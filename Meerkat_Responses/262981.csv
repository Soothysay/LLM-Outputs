   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and today transferred to MICU to due
   worsening respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia and increasing oxygen requirement. Was
   transferred on 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at 92-93%.
   Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.  Acute hypoxic event
   yesterday today thought to be due to decreasing respiratory drive from
   methadone in setting of increased pulmonary edema.  Overnight,
   transitioned to Bipap.
   - Continue 02 as tolerated BiPap as needed to maintain 02 Sats>92%
   - check daily weight
   - follow I/O with goal 500cc neg
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - will send BNP and obtain TTE to rule out cardiac cause of pulm edema
   - Will place a-line for serial ABGs
   - Vanc/cefipime started for possible aspiration pneumonia
   .
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 93**],
   now 2.0, from 1.9 yesterday. Currently undergoing treatment for HRS. No
   hypertension. Last paracentesis [**9-13**] ~3L. Urine Na 21 on [**9-10**], urine
   culture with contaminants. Potassium at time of transfer was 5.2

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8072**] is transferred to the ICU with progressive hypoxemic
   respiratory distress.  She denies nausea and there was no witnessed
   aspiration event noted. She has been therapeutically tapped for
   worsening ascites. She has needed BiPAP overnight but does not appear
   to be using accessory muscles at present on NRB oxygen.
   We will treat for possible aspiration with resultant [**Doctor Last Name 2**]/ early ARDS
   and also diurese with lasix if there is an element of hydrostatic edema
   (elevated JVP and HJR). Other possible atypical pathogens may be at
   play too. BNP/ cardiac echo will be ordered today and an A line placed
   for closer BP/ ABG monitoring. A PICC line will be placed for infusion
   antibiotics and octreotide if needed. She is a full code and if needed
   would intubate for worsening hypoxemia.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. She was previously on methadone, which may have contributed to her hypoxic event yesterday. The patient's oxygen saturation was initially at 92-93% and she required 15L rebreather and 4L NC. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV prior to transfer. Overnight, she was transitioned to BiPAP.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia and increasing oxygen requirement. She will continue on 02 as tolerated BiPAP to maintain O2 Sats >92%. Daily weight, I/O, serial chest exams, albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing, sparing use of diuretics due to Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS), fluid restriction to 750 cc, BNP and TTE to rule out cardiac cause of pulmonary edema, and a-line for serial ABGs will be done.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level was 1.2, which increased to 2.7 on admission and now it is 2"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She has been admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxia and has required an increasing amount of oxygen. She was initially placed on a rebreather and then transitioned to BiPAP to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%.

The patient's recent medical history includes a failed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure and previous episodes of abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. She also has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is currently receiving insulin therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 106/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of PCV+Assist, set respiratory rate of 14, peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/d"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She has diabetes mellitus and presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. She has an elevated creatinine level, indicating acute kidney injury (ARF), and her MELD score is 20. She also has a history of failed TIPS procedure, elevated AFP levels, and congestive gastropathy. The patient is currently receiving treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and is being managed with diuretics, albumin infusions, and lactulose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has experienced hypoxia overnight and requires supplemental oxygen. She is currently on 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at 92-93%. The hypoxia may be due to decreased respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, indicating the possibility of acute respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support with BiPap as needed are recommended to maintain 02 sats >92%.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has ARF with a creatinine level of 2.0, and there is"

   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU to due worsening
   respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films yesterday suggestive of ARDS,
   corroborated by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs.
   hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP
   throughout day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without
   positive pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She also has diabetes mellitus. The patient presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. She was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
1. Hypoxia - The patient experienced hypoxia overnight and required supplemental oxygen. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV prior to transfer.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) - The patient's chest films showed findings suggestive of ARDS, which was confirmed by a normal TTE (Transthoracic Echocardiogram). The etiology of ARDS is uncertain, with possibilities including HAP (Healthcare-associated pneumonia), hepatopulmonary syndrome, or SBP (Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).
3. BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) - The patient tolerated BiPAP well, maintaining oxygen saturation above 92%. This may be continued as needed.
4. Fluid management - The patient's fluid intake will be restricted to 750 cc, and the head of bed will be elevated >30 degrees. Diuretics will be used sparingly due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
5. Acute kidney injury (ARF) - The patient's baseline creatinine level"

   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU to due worsening
   respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films yesterday suggestive of ARDS,
   corroborated by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs.
   hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP
   throughout day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without
   positive pressure.
   - Continue BiPap as needed to maintain 02 Sats>92%, consider trial of
   non-rebreather if chest film improved this AM
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS -> lasix 40 IV given this am
   since Cr stable
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - Will recheck ABG this afternoon and consider intubation if
   respiratory status not improved

   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films yesterday suggestive of ARDS,
   corroborated by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs.
   hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP
   throughout day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without
   positive pressure.
   - Continue BiPap as needed to maintain 02 Sats>92%, consider trial of
   non-rebreather if chest film improved this AM
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS -> lasix 40 IV given this am
   since Cr stable
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - Will recheck ABG this afternoon and consider intubation if
   respiratory status not improved

   CRITICAL CARE ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She remains on BiPAP today with stable sats and no worsening tachypnea.
   Creat down to 1.8 but CXR has not improved. I am worried about atypical
   infection including PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will induce sputum for PCP today and
   [**Name9 (PRE) 8097**] treat with steroids/ bactrim (dosed for creatinine
   clearance). An HIV test will be obtained . if she should need
   intubation, we will proceed with bronchoscopy and BAL. ? possibility of
   eosioniphilic pneumonia despite lack of peripheral eos raised. Urine
   will be screened for esopiniphils.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine levels, leading to her transfer to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia overnight and a new oxygen requirement. Initially, she required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining O2 sats at 92-93%. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer. An acute hypoxic event earlier on the day of transfer to CCU likely resulted from decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. Repeat chest films yesterday suggested ARDS, corroborated by a normal TTE. The etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs. hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely). The patient has been maintained on BiPAP throughout the day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without positive pressure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a compromised respiratory function. This could be due to ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), which is suggested by the chest films and normal TTE.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating impaired renal function. This may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. She was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has diabetes mellitus, which is well controlled on insulin at home.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient experienced hypoxia overnight and required supplemental oxygen. She was given Lasix 40 mg IV before transfer and maintained on BiPAP to maintain oxygen saturation above 92%. Further interventions include considering a trial of non-rebreather if chest film improves, elevating the head of the bed, and following clinically with serial chest exams.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's chest films showed signs suggestive of ARDS, which was confirmed by a normal trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Etiology of ARDS includes Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), hepatopulmonary syndrome, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient will be continued on BiPAP as needed and may require intubation if respiratory status does not improve.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level increased from 1.2 to 2.7 on admission and is now 2.0. She is undergoing treatment"

   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing [**Month/Year (2) 1476**] drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films consistent with ARDS, corroborated
   by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs. hepatopulmonary
   syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP throughout day
   and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without positive
   pressure.  Attempts to wean FiO2 below 80% have been unsuccessful.
   - Consider intubation this AM, as Bipap resulting in skin breakdown and
   unable to wean

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She has diabetes mellitus and presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening hepatic status.

The patient experienced hypoxia overnight and required new oxygen support. Initially, she needed 15L rebreather and 4L NC to maintain oxygen saturation at 92-93%. Lasix 40 mg IV was given prior to transfer. An acute hypoxic event earlier on the day of transfer to CCU likely occurred due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. Repeat chest films consistent with ARDS were corroborated by normal TTE. Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs. hepatopulmonary syndrome vs. SBP (less likely). The patient was maintained on BiPAP throughout the day and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without positive pressure. Attempts to wean FiO2 below 80% have been unsuccessful.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential hypoxia, which may require further intervention such as intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events indicate the administration of Lasix 40mg IV twice, repeated lithium levels which are stable, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) to be repeated around 3 pm with no change from the previous results. The patient tolerates FiO2 of 80% but was unable to tolerate a lower FiO2, as attempted reduction to 60 resulted in a pO2 on ABG down to 50. The patient also has skin breakdown on the nose and chin due to the use of bipap.

The patient has been started on Bactrim/solumedrol due to concern for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP). Induction sputum is being attempted to send for PCP testing. The patient's last dose of antibiotics includes vancomycin, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, and Bactrim.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature (Tmax) is 36.7°C (98°F) and current temperature (Tcurrent) is 35.6°C (96°F). The patient's heart rate (HR) is 54 bpm with a range of 54-72 bpm, blood pressure (BP) is 122/56 mmHg with a previous reading of 73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) is"

   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing [**Month/Year (2) 1476**] drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films consistent with ARDS, corroborated
   by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs. hepatopulmonary
   syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP throughout day
   and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without positive

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She has been admitted to the ICU with worsening liver function, acute hypoxic event, and respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's oxygen requirement increased overnight, and she is currently on BiPAP with FiO2 of 80%. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxic event suggests difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation. Continuous monitoring and consideration for intubation may be necessary.
2. ARDS: The patient's chest films are consistent with ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate renal impairment, which could be due to HRS. Treatment for HRS should be initiated.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Although the patient's SBP is negative at the moment, monitoring for any signs of infection or worsening abdominal symptoms is crucial.
5. Hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS): Given the patient's history of liver disease and respiratory issues, HPS should also be considered and monitored for.
6. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): The patient has an elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, which raises the possibility of HCC. Further evaluation is needed"

   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU to due worsening
   [**Month/Year (2) 1476**] status.
   .
   # Hypoxia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen requirement.
   Initially required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining 02 sats at
   92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event earlier on day of transfer to CCU likely due to
   decreasing [**Month/Year (2) 1476**] drive from methadone in setting of increased
   pulmonary edema.  Repeat chest films consistent with ARDS, corroborated
   by normal TTE.  Etiology of ARDS includes HAP vs. hepatopulmonary
   syndrome vs. SBP (less likely).  Pt maintained on BiPAP throughout day
   and overnight, tolerated well, desats to 70s without positive
   pressure.  Attempts to wean FiO2 below 80% have been unsuccessful.
   - Consider intubation this AM, as Bipap resulting in skin breakdown and
   unable to wean
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS -> lasix 40 IV x2 given over past
   24 hours

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8072**] was intubated earlier today for worsening [**Known lastname 1476**]
   fatigue on BiPAP. She has needed sedation to allow us to ventilate and
   oxygenate her with increasing levels of PEEP. Bronchscopy / BAL will be
   performed at the bedside to r/o atypical pathogens including PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 6568**] test is awaited. We will continue bactrim/ steroids in addition to
   treatment of nosocomial pneumonia. She will have close monitoring of
   ABG
s and management of airway pressures on ARDSNet ventilator stategy.
   We will continue tube feeds as tolerated. Her children have been
   updated regarding her condition.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and an elevated creatinine level. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening liver status.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), hepatic cirrhosis with ascites, and diabetes. She has been on BiPAP throughout the day and overnight, but is unable to tolerate FiO2 below 80%. The patient also has skin breakdown on her nose and chin from BiPAP use.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Further deterioration of ARDS and the need for intubation.
2. Progression of AKI and the development of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).
3. Development of infections, including pneumonia and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
4. Complications related to diabetes management, such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Bleeding or variceal hemorrhage due to portal hypertension.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy.
7. Hepatocellular carcinoma.

These are potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's current condition and medical history."

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, s/p failed TIPS procedure,
   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU due to worsening
   respiratory status.
   .
   # Hypoxemia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen
   requirement.  Originally required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining
   02 sats at 92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer likely due to decreasing
   respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased pulmonary
   edema.  Pt is now s/p endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG.
   Suspect mild ARDS  in setting of HAP
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - will f/u BAL results, specifically PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]; low pre-test
   probability, but in interim will continue bactrim and prednisolone
   - goal Is/Os today is even, will give lasix IV PRN to achieve goal
   - will cont Abx today day [**5-19**]
   - daily portable chest films
   .
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 93**],
   now 2.0, from 1.9. Currently undergoing treatment for HRS. No
   hypertension. Last paracentesis [**9-13**] ~3L. Urine Na 21 on [**9-10**], urine
   culture with contaminants. Potassium at time of transfer was 5.2.
   - Repeat serum lytes
   - Kayexalate PRN
   - low potassium diet
   - Continue [**Month (only) **]/mid/alb, goal creatinine 1.5, no diuretics at this time
   - monitor blood pressure
   - daily creatinine
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis and ascites: Pt w/ chronic HCV and cirrhosis (Grade 1
   varices and congestive gastropathy) that is usually managed by weekly
   parascentesis, s/p failed TIPS ([**7-20**]). SBP (-) on [**9-13**]. Also has elevated
   AFP=10.2. Para cx NG from [**9-13**]. Patent main portal vein and hepatic
   vasculature. MELD 20 today.
   - continue [**Month (only) **]/mild/albumin - patient appears to be benefitting
   - continue holding diuretics
   - continue lactulose
   - consider paracentsis today
   - TIPS to be done as outpatient.
   - f/u on calorie count.
   .
   # Diabetes. Patient reports that her diabetes is well controlled on
   insulin at home.
   - Continue Insulin, control has worsened in setting of steroids, will
   cont SSI for now, consider gtt if continued poor control
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes as needed, will start TF today,
   appreciate nutrition recs, will give vit K for increasing INR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis, complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient experienced an acute hypoxic event overnight and required endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is now on ARDSnet protocol and tolerating it well. There is suspicion of mild ARDS in the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's head of bed should be elevated >30 degrees, and she should be monitored with serial chest exams. Nebulized albuterol/ipratropium should be given every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. Diuretic use should be limited due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and fluid intake should be restricted to 750 mL. Blood cultures and BAL results, specifically PCP, should be followed up on. Bactrim and prednisolone should continue until further results are available. The goal is to maintain isotonic balance today, with Lasix IV given as needed to achieve this goal. Antibiotics will be continued today.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF), with a creatinine level of 2.7 on admission from a baseline of 1.2,"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has responded well to sedation/ PEEP and continued antibiotics. Her
   infiltrates have improved and lung compliance has also increased. She
   is no longer that hypoxemic and continues to have a brisk urine
   output/. Glycemic control has been a problem.
   We will await results of BAL before tapering antibiotics/ steroids and
   wean PEEP slowly. If possible, she will also have sedation adjusted to
   allow CPAP/ PSV in am [**2140-9-20**] if there is continued improvement in [**Doctor Last Name 2**]/
   ARDS. Nutritional support will be started with tube feeds.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status and required endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating ARDSnet protocol well.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced hypoxemia overnight and required increased oxygen. She was given Lasix IV x 1 prior to transfer. The hypoxic event was likely due to decreased respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. Mild ARDS is suspected in the setting of HAP.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine was 1.2, which increased to 2.7 on admission and now 2.0. She is undergoing treatment for Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS). No hypertension was noted, and the urine Na was 21 on 09/10. Potassium at the time of transfer was 5.2.
3. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis and Ascites: The patient has chronic HCV cirrhosis with grade 1 varices and congestive gastropathy. She previously had a failed TIPS procedure and currently has elevated AFP levels. She"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis, complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. They presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, elevated creatinine, and were transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient experienced an acute hypoxic event prior to transfer, likely due to decreased respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. The patient is now intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG.

There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is suspected of having mild ARDS in the setting of HAP. Close monitoring of daily weight, elevating the head of bed, following clinically with serial chest exams, and using albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing should be implemented.

2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: Due to the patient's cirrhosis and ascites, there is a risk of hepatic hydrothorax developing, which is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space. This can lead to respiratory compromise.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to HRS, a type of kidney failure that occurs in advanced liver disease. Close monitoring of"

   presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and found to
   have an elevated creatinine and transferred to MICU due to worsening
   respiratory status.

   # Hypoxemia - Patient with hypoxia overnight and new oxygen
   requirement.  Originally required 15L rebreather and 4L NC maintaining
   02 sats at 92-93%. Given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 prior to transfer.
   Acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer likely due to decreasing
   respiratory drive from methadone in setting of increased pulmonary
   edema.  Pt is now s/p endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG.
   Suspect mild ARDS  in setting of HAP

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites.
- She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, elevated creatinine, and worsening respiratory status.
- The patient was transferred to the MICU due to hypoxemia and required endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure.
- She is currently being managed for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), hepatic hydrothorax, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
- The patient also has a history of diabetes, which is poorly controlled in the setting of steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to the need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's presentation and clinical findings, ARDS is suspected. This condition can progress and lead to severe lung dysfunction.
3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): The patient has evidence of renal dysfunction with elevated creatinine levels. HRS is a potential complication of cirrhosis and can lead to acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   She has had a slow PEEP wean and appears to be tolerating this without
   significant setbacks. FiO2 still at 0.6. Her chest XR has shown slow
   resolution of infiltrates and she will do well to start diuresis with
   goals for fluid balance of net negative 1-1.5L. We will also transition
   to CPAP/ PSV in next 24 hours if sedation levels allow as lung
   compliance is not severely decreased. Bactrim and steroids stopped with
   negative BAL stain for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] feed goals are being met. Urine
   culture from [**9-15**] shows pansensitive Klebsiella.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites, bilateral leg edema, and elevated creatinine. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status and required endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatic encephalopathy (HRS), acute kidney injury (ARF), and hepatocellular carcinoma (elevated AFP). She also has diabetes mellitus, which is well controlled on insulin.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 43 bpm, blood pressure 137/69 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, lactate, and liver enzymes. Her blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels are also elevated. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs at the bases, soft and non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, distended abdomen, muscle wasting, and warm skin. 

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing with ARDSnet protocol, elevating the head of bed, using"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicated by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, presented with abdominal
   ascites, and found to have an elevated creatinine and transferred to
   MICU due to worsening respiratory status.
   # Respiratory distress- Acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer
   likely due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of
   increased pulmonary edema.  Pt is now s/p endotracheal intubation for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with
   improved exam and ABG.  Suspect mild pulmonary edema secondary to HRS
   versus ARDS (although no e/o HAP on BAL micro).
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - daily portable chest films
   - decreased PEEP today
   - over next several days will try to transition from versed to propofol
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 93**],
   now 2.1. Suspect HRS as etiology of pt's renal failure.
   - Continue HRS regimen (octreotide, midodrine, albumin)
   - Renal consult per hepatology, re: HRS dx
   - [**Month (only) 11**] require additional paracentesis tomorrow, hold off for now due to
   ARF
   # HCV cirrhosis and ascites: Pt w/ chronic HCV and cirrhosis (Grade 1
   varices and congestive gastropathy) that is usually managed by weekly
   paracentesis, s/p failed TIPS ([**7-20**]). SBP (-) on [**9-13**]. Also has elevated
   AFP=10.2. Para cx NG from [**9-13**]. Patent main portal vein and hepatic
   vasculature.
   - continue [**Month (only) **]/mild - patient appears to be benefiting
   - give albumin 50g today
   - gentle diuretics to restart once renal function improves
   - continue lactulose
   - TIPS to be done as outpatient.
   - possible para tomorrow
   # Thrombocytopenia: Differential includes drug-induced (heparin versus
   vanco), liver disease, sequestration [**2-15**] splenomegaly. Do not suspect
   hemolysis as bili is normal. 4T score is 4 (intermediate prob) and
   heparin products have been held since 2 days into hospitalization.
   Unclear if pt has HIT
   - Continue to hold heparin products
   - D/c Vanco
   - Trend plts
   - discuss with heme need to start direct thrombin inhibitor
   # UTI: Pt has klebsiella growing on urine culture.
   - d/c cefepime
   - 7 day course of abx with cipro
   # Diabetes.
   - Insulin SS for now as pt on continuous TF
   # Decreased stomach motility: KUB with large stomach, large residuals
   - will start reglan 5mg TID
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes as needed, started TF, appreciate
   nutrition recs, will give vit K for increasing INR

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites and was found to have elevated creatinine levels. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient experienced an acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer, likely due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. She is now intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is tolerating the ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG.

The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient had an acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer, which was likely due to decreased respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. She is now on mechanical ventilation and is tolerating it well with improved exam and ABG. Mild pulmonary edema secondary to Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS) versus Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is suspected, although no evidence of Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) on BAL micro.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a creatinine level of 2.7 on admission from a baseline of 1.2, suggesting acute kidney injury. HRS is suspected as the etiology of the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo woman with a history of chronic Hep C cirrhosis complicatied by
   portal HTN and refractory ascites, DM, presented with abdominal
   ascites, and found to have an elevated creatinine and transferred to
   MICU due to worsening respiratory status.
   # Respiratory distress- Acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer
   likely due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of
   increased pulmonary edema.  Pt is now s/p endotracheal intubation for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with
   improved exam and ABG.  Suspect mild pulmonary edema secondary to HRS
   versus ARDS (although no e/o HAP on BAL micro).
   - check daily weight
   - elevate head of bed >30 degrees.
   - follow clinically with serial chest exams
   - albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn SOB or wheezing
   - sparing use of diuretics due to HRS
   - Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
   - goal Is/Os today is -1L (already -1.5L)
   - Gentle diuresis in future per hepatology recs, consider lasix gtt
   - daily portable chest films
   # ARF: Pt w/ Cr of 2.7 on admission from baseline of 1.2 in early [**Month (only) 93**],
   now 2.1. Suspect HRS as etiology of pt's renal failure.
   - Continue HRS regimen (octreotide, midodrine, albumin)
   - Renal consult per hepatology, re: CVVH
   - [**Month (only) 11**] require additional paracentesis tomorrow as abdomen distended;
   but is currently having robust urination with lasix
   # HCV cirrhosis and ascites: Pt w/ chronic HCV and cirrhosis (Grade 1
   varices and congestive gastropathy) that is usually managed by weekly
   parascentesis, s/p failed TIPS ([**7-20**]). SBP (-) on [**9-13**]. Also has elevated
   AFP=10.2. Para cx NG from [**9-13**]. Patent main portal vein and hepatic
   vasculature.
   - continue [**Month (only) **]/mild/albumin - patient appears to be benefitting
   - gentle diuretics
   - continue lactulose
   - TIPS to be done as outpatient.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Differential includes drug-induced (heparin versus
   vanco), liver disease, sequestration [**2-15**] splenomegaly. Do not suspect
   hemolysis as bili is normal. 4T score is 4 (intermediate prob) and
   heparin products have been held since 2 days into hospitalization.
   - Continue to hold heparin products
   - D/c Vanco
   - Trend plts
   # UTI: Pt has klebsiella growing on urine culture.
   - If continues to be afebrile overnight would favor d/c cefepime and
   complete 7 day course of abx with cipro
   # Diabetes.
   - Insulin SS for now as pt on continuous TF
    FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes as needed, started TF, appreciate
   nutrition recs, will give vit K for increasing INR

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites and an elevated creatinine, leading to her transfer to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. 

The patient is currently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG. She is suspected to have mild pulmonary edema secondary to Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS) versus Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 

The assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient experienced an acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer, likely due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. She is now intubated and tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG. Suspect mild pulmonary edema secondary to HRS versus ARDS.

- Check daily weight
- Elevate head of bed >30 degrees
- Follow clinically with serial chest exams

- Sparingly use diuretics due to HRS
- Will fluid restrict to 750 cc
- Goal Is/Os today is -1L (already -1.5L)

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and cirrhosis. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. They have a known allergy to benzocaine and an unknown general allergy. The patient has been receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, diuretics, sedatives, pain medications, and others.

The 24-hour events include diuresis of 1.5L yesterday, increased versed due to agitation, and weaning FiO2 down to 50% with a saturation of 98%. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure of 123/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. The patient's temperature is 37.4 C (99.4 F), and their Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is not assessed.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished but thin, with no PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and normal cardiovascular exam. The patient has crackles in the anterior chest, soft and distended abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, increased creatinine, low white blood cell count, and platelet count within normal limits. Other lab results"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and cirrhosis. They have been sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient's allergies include benzocaine and unknown general allergens. They have received various antibiotics, including Bactrim, Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Ciprofloxacin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/55-147/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 50% FiO2. They are on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate normal oxygenation and ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, normal cardiovascular system, symmetric chest expansion with crackles in the anterior region, distended abdomen, and absence of lower extremity edema. Neurologic assessment is not possible due to sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, increased creatinine, and abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests. Imaging"

   MICU due to worsening respiratory status.
   # Respiratory distress- Acute hypoxic event prior to MICU transfer
   likely due to decreasing respiratory drive from methadone in setting of
   increased pulmonary edema.  Pt is now s/p endotracheal intubation for
   hypoxemic respiratory failure, tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with
   improved exam and ABG.  Suspect mild pulmonary edema secondary to HRS
   versus ARDS (although no e/o HAP on BAL micro). Was able to wean down
   her FIO2 to 40% overnight but worsening airspace opacity with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis complicated by portal hypertension and refractory ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, acute respiratory failure, and hypoxemia. She presented with abdominal ascites and an elevated creatinine level. 

The patient was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status and was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure prior to transfer. She underwent endotracheal intubation and is tolerating ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG. There is suspicion of mild pulmonary edema secondary to Hepatic Respiratory Syndrome (HRS) versus Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's FiO2 was decreased to 40% overnight, but there is worsening airspace opacity with decreasing PEEP.

The patient's recent lab results show a platelet count of 58,000/uL, which indicates thrombocytopenia. The differential includes drug-induced (heparin versus vancomycin), liver disease, and sequestration in the spleen due to splenomegaly. The 4T score is 4, suggesting an intermediate probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin products have been held since the second day of hospitalization.

The patient has also been diagnosed with acute renal failure, with a creatinine level of 2.7 from a"

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites, as well as type II diabetes mellitus. She presented with abdominal ascites and elevated creatinine levels, leading to transfer to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient experienced acute hypoxic events prior to MICU transfer, likely due to decreased respiratory drive from methadone in the setting of increased pulmonary edema. She is now intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and tolerating the ARDSnet protocol well with improved exam and ABG.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CMV mode, set Vt of 450 mL, RR of 18, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%. Her SpO2 is 98%, and her ABG shows pH 7.44, PaCO2 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 223. She has mild pulmonary edema secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Daily chest exams, head-of-bed elevation, and fluid restriction should be maintained. There is a plan to decrease PEEP and transition from versed to propofol sedation.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, refractory ascites, diabetes mellitus, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She presented with abdominal ascites and an elevated creatinine level, leading to her transfer to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to worsening respiratory status.

The patient underwent endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation. She is suspected to have mild pulmonary edema secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) versus ARDS. The patient also has restrictive lung disease due to large ascitic abdomen. There has been minimal improvement in weaning from the ventilator, so the FiO2 was increased to 50%. Lasix infusion was held per renal recommendations, and a small volume paracentesis will be attempted today.

The patient's renal function is impaired, with a creatinine level of 2.7 on admission from a baseline of 1.2 in early [Month 93], now 2.3, up from 2.1 yesterday. This suggests prerenal failure versus HRS as the etiology of the patient's renal failure. She is receiving treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (octreotide, midodrine, albumin), and a small volume paracentesis will be performed to improve respiratory status and minimize fluid shifts.

The patient has a history of chronic Hepatitis C and cir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, refractory ascites, type II diabetes mellitus, and worsening respiratory status. She presented with abdominal ascites and elevated creatinine levels. She was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status and is now on mechanical ventilation for hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is tolerating ARDSnet protocol well. There is suspicion of mild pulmonary edema secondary to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has a large ascitic abdomen, restrictive lung process, and minimal improvement in weaning from the ventilator. She had a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of the right lower lobe. Her CXR showed effusion on the right lung. She has a history of chronic HCV and cirrhosis with grade 1 varices and congestive gastropathy. She underwent a failed transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) on [**7-20**]. She has negative spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) on [**9-13**], elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) of 10.2, and para cx NG from [**9-13**].

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, refractory ascites, diabetes mellitus (type II), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She presented with abdominal ascites, elevated creatinine, and worsening respiratory status, leading to endotracheal intubation for hypoxemic respiratory failure.

The patient has been weaned down to FiO2 of 40% and still requires PEEP of 12. A bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (BAL) of the right lower lobe was performed on 9/22 with no growth. The plan is to repeat paracentesis today and attempt to wean sedation followed by a trial of pressure support (PS). The patient had been apneic on PS the previous day.

The patient's daily weight should be checked, and re-tap is planned today as the patient tolerated the procedure yesterday. The head of bed should be elevated >30 degrees, and albuterol/ipratropium nebs should be given every 6 hours as needed for shortness of breath or wheezing. Sedation should be continued with fentanyl/propofol/versed and weaned after the tap. VAP bundle should be continued, and extubation should be attempted after the second paracentesis.

The patient has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine of 2.3 and is currently trending down to 1."

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, refractory ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, and acute respiratory failure. She presented with abdominal ascites and an elevated creatinine level. She was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. 

She is currently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and has a large ascitic abdomen, indicating a restrictive process. She also has a right-sided pleural effusion, which could indicate hepatic hydrothorax. Her FiO2 was decreased to 40% overnight, but she still requires a PEEP of 12. She underwent bronchoscopy on September 22nd with a BAL from the right lower lobe, but no growth was found. 

She is being managed with several interventions including elevating the head of the bed >30 degrees, using albuterol/ipratropium nebs q6h prn for SOB or wheezing, continuing sedation with fentanyl/propofol/versed, implementing a VAP bundle, and attempting extubation after the second paracentesis. 

The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 1.2 that increased to 2.7 on admission and is now trending down to 1.8. Urine sediment shows crystals/granular casts. She is receiving treatment for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) with octre"

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, refractory ascites, diabetes mellitus type II, acute respiratory failure, and chronic viral hepatitis. She presented with abdominal ascites and elevated creatinine levels. She was transferred to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient is currently intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure and is tolerating the ARDSnet protocol well. There is suspicion of mild pulmonary edema secondary to hepatorenal syndrome versus acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although no evidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia on bronchoalveolar lavage microscopy. Additionally, the patient has a restrictive process due to large ascitic abdomen. Minimal improvement has been seen in weaning from the ventilator, so the FiO2 has been increased to 50%. Lasix gtt has been held. A bronch was performed on 9/22 with a BAL of the right lower lobe. The chest X-ray shows effusion on the right lung.

The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 2.3 from a baseline of 1.2. This suggests prerenal azotemia versus hepatorenal syndrome as the etiology of the patient's renal failure. The HRS regimen (octreotide, midodrine, albumin) is to be continued. A small volume paracentesis will be attempted today to improve respiratory status"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual with refractory ascites. They have undergone a paracentesis, removing 3.5 liters of fluid. The patient's creatinine levels have improved as a result. The patient is sedated and in encephalopathy, unable to provide their medical history. 

The patient is currently on various medications including insulin sliding scale, celexa, midodrine, octreotide, lactulose, chlorhexidine, rifaximin, reglan, levofloxacin, and protonix. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 50 bpm, blood pressure of 95/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set volume of 450 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and ABG results of ///22/. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat, normal heart sounds, diminished breath sounds on the right side, symmetrical chest expansion, edema absence in both lower extremities, muscle wasting, warm skin, and unresponsive neurologic status with purposeful movements. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.1 K/uL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She also has diabetes mellitus and presented with abdominal ascites, elevated creatinine, and worsening respiratory status. The patient was transferred to the MICU due to respiratory distress and is now intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. She has a large ascitic abdomen and a right-sided pleural effusion, indicating hepatic hydrothorax. The patient underwent a bronchoscopic lavage on 9/22 with BAL of right lower lobe. She had paracentesis performed yesterday, resulting in improvement in her respiratory status and minimizing fluid shifts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemic respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.
2. Hepatic Hydrothorax: The presence of a right-sided pleural effusion suggests the possibility of hepatic hydrothorax, a complication of cirrhosis where fluid accumulates in the pleural space due to increased pressure in the portal vein.
3. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and ascites, there is a risk of SBP, a potentially severe infection of the ascitic fluid.

","The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She also has diabetes mellitus and presented with abdominal ascites. Her current conditions include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, bradycardia, diabetes mellitus type II, hypoxemia, and ineffective coping. The patient has been in the ICU due to worsening respiratory status and required intubation.

The patient underwent bronchoscopic lavage and respiratory culture, which showed the presence of yeast and absence of oropharyngeal flora. She has been on a regimen of octreotide, midodrine, and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient also has thrombocytopenia, likely due to drug-induced causes, liver disease, or sequestration. Klebsiella was found in her urine culture, and she has completed a 7-day course of antibiotics. She has decreased stomach motility, and her diabetes is being managed with insulin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/79 mmHg to 164/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 1,620 mL and total output of 4,330 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 2,710 mL. She is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The respiratory culture indicates the presence of yeast, and the fungal culture is pending. The patient's platelet count is low, and she has thrombocytopenia. The arterial blood gas values are within normal limits.

The patient's plan includes weaning off midazolam and fentanyl, attempting extubation today if more alert, checking daily weight, elevating the head of the bed, administering albuterol/ipratropium nebs every six hours as needed, implementing a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle, holding tube feeds for possible extubation, repleting phosphate, and continuing hepatorenal syndrome treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and refractory ascites. She presented with abdominal ascites and elevated creatinine levels, leading to her transfer to the MICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, likely due to a restrictive process caused by her large ascitic abdomen and possible hepatic hydrothorax. She underwent bronchoscopy with BAL of the right lower lobe and had paracentesis yesterday, which resulted in an improvement in her respiratory status and minimal fluid shifts.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing restrictive respiratory distress due to her large ascitic abdomen and possibly hepatic hydrothorax. This has been managed with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and bronchoscopy with BAL of the right lower lobe.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 1.2, which has increased to 2.7 on admission and is now trending down to 1.7. This indicates acute kidney injury, likely not hepatorenal given the improvement in creatinine levels. The patient is being treated for hepatorenal syndrome with octreotide, midodrine, and albumin.

3. Hepatitis C Cirrhosis and Ascites: The patient has chronic Hepatitis C cirrhosis with grade 1 var"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and cirrhosis. They have been sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient is on multiple medications, including fentanyl for pain management, pantoprazole for acid reflux, heparin for prophylaxis against blood clots, and several others for various conditions such as cirrhosis and diabetes. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation and is expected to be extubated in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is acute respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxemia and subsequent organ damage if not promptly managed.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of cirrhosis puts them at risk for complications such as portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Ineffective Coping: The patient is experiencing ineffective coping mechanisms, possibly due to their critical condition. This may lead to increased stress and anxiety for both the patient and the family.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Although the patient's thrombocytopenia has resolved after discontinuing vancomycin and ranitidine"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan.

   on:[**2140-9-26**] 15:55 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on pressure support trial and has a history of respiratory failure. There is a risk of recurring respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of cirrhosis indicates underlying liver disease. This condition can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Encephalopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, which can be a result of liver dysfunction or other factors. Monitoring and managing this condition is important to prevent further deterioration.

4. Hypertension: The patient has intermittent hypertension, which could be related to medication use or withdrawal symptoms. It is crucial to monitor blood pressure closely and adjust treatment accordingly.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has excoriated areas, indicating possible skin breakdown or infection. Proper wound care and monitoring are necessary to prevent further complications.

6. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory values show signs of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of kidney function and appropriate management are essential.

7. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's tube feeds are on hold for extubation. Assessing swallow function after extubation and placing an NG tube if needed are important to maintain adequate nutrition.

8. Ineffective coping: The patient may be experiencing stress or difficulties in adapting to the ICU environment"
