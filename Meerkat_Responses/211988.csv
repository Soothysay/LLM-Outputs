   Assessment and Plan
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF, now s/p
   PEA arrest today.
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on and poor O2 sat pleth prior to event.  Probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also consider PE
   (other etiologies more likely and oxygenating well) and need to
   consider air embolus given timing.
   - CT head and chest without obvious air embolism
 f/u final reads
   - Appears to be hemodynamically stable currently off pressors
   - Continues on arctic sun protocol with consult service on board
   - F/u consult service recs
   - Continue for 24 hrs total
   - Trend CE
s for one more value and if continues to trend down can stop
   trending
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenating well on code ABG.
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  On propofol; also given IV ativan
   x1 without significant change.
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today, so far no
   activity to suggest seizures
   - Neuro following.
   - Cooling as above.
   - Neuro recs MRI to further eval hypoxic injury to brain, can consider
   once pt stabilized and done with cooling
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - f/u renal recs.
   - BK virus pending
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Respiratory acidosis.  Will now be able to correct with vent but
   unclear why has appeared to have this chronically.  One concern was
   lack of reliability of ABGs given past UE fistulas, but some ABG pH
   seem out of proportion to what expected if solely from this.  Chronic
   respiratory acidosis of ?etiology, ?obesity hypoventilation.
   - Adjust vent prn for goal pCO2 high 50s-low 60s.
   - A line in place.
   .
   # HTN.
   - Hold antiHTNs for now.
   .
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on
   metabolism/gluconeogenesis?
   - D/c Glargine and cover with only sliding scale.
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   .
   # ?UTI. Borderline UA.
   - Will await culture, if positive start [**Doctor Last Name **] other than cipro given
   ?seizure.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus type II (DM), and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest (PEA arrest) likely due to hypoxia or acidosis. 

The patient's current assessment includes ongoing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, potential seizure activity, acute on chronic renal failure, chronic respiratory acidosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and anemia. There are also concerns about a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The plan involves continued monitoring and treatment for these conditions. The patient is currently being cooled as part of the Arctic sun protocol to protect the brain after the cardiac arrest. An EEG is ongoing to evaluate for seizure activity. Renal failure management includes CVVH and awaiting results for BK virus. The patient's diabetes management involves discontinuing Glargine and using a sliding scale for blood sugar control. 

Other interventions include adjusting the ventilator settings to correct respiratory acidosis, holding anti-HTN medications, and awaiting urine culture results. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending clinical improvement."

   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on and poor O2 sat pleth prior to event.  Probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also consider PE
   (other etiologies more likely and oxygenating well) and need to
   consider air embolus given timing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) today and required resuscitation. The likely etiology of the arrest is hypoxia due to difficulties in keeping the mask on and poor oxygen saturation prior to the event. Other possible causes include acidosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and air embolus. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure, End Stage (ESRD): The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently experiencing acute renal failure. The etiology of ARF is unclear. The patient is receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).
2. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to hypoventilation-related hypoxia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with assisted control (AC) settings.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest today, likely secondary to hypoxia. The cause is still under investigation, with possible contributing factors including acidosis, PE, and air embolus.
4. Seizure Activity vs. Myoclonus: The patient has been experiencing seizure-like"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Renal failure: The patient is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), indicating severe kidney dysfunction or failure.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may not be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient requires invasive ventilation support.

3. Cardiac arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, indicating a life-threatening heart rhythm disturbance that caused a temporary loss of heart function.

4. Neurological injury: The patient is showing signs of neurologic injury, possibly due to hypoxic brain injury. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended during the cooling protocol. Posturing should not be treated with benzodiazepines unless there is concern for prolonged seizure activity.

5. Hypoglycemia: The patient has low blood sugars, which may require close monitoring and management.

6. Infectious complications: The patient's cultures are pending for blood, urine, and sputum. There is a possibility of developing infections, especially considering the invasive lines and ventilatory support.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU. Prophylaxis measures should be in place to prevent clot formation.

8. Stress ulcer: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness and the use of corticosteroids. Prophylaxis with"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on and poor O2 sat pleth prior to event.  Probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation.
   - CT chest final read without evidence of air embolism, although
   atelectasis vs PNA found
   - CT head pending final read; sinuses look full
   - Norepinephrine as a pressor.  Patient requiring this again starting
   at midnight
   - Arctic sun protocol finished
   - F/u consult service recs
   - Has not been getting Cisatracurium boluses any longer- no shivering;
   keep order written in case shivering occur again
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenating well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest.  Also,
   had an episode of desat yesterday to 73.  Was suctioned and bagged and
   improved.
   -Bronchoscopy today for mucous plug removal
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now
   -Send sputum for culture because first was contaminated
   -Possibly start antibiotics if ABG's worsen
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  On propofol; also given IV ativan
   x1 without significant change.
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today, so far no
   activity to suggest seizures
   - Neuro following.
   - Neuro recs MRI to further eval hypoxic injury to brain, can consider
   once pt stabilized and done with cooling
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - Renal recs
   -----add CVVHD with citrate
   -----renal dosing of ceftriaxone
   -----MMF for immunosuppression
   - BK virus pending
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Respiratory acidosis.  Will now be able to correct with vent but
   unclear why has appeared to have this chronically.  One concern was
   lack of reliability of ABGs given past UE fistulas, but some ABG pH
   seem out of proportion to what expected if solely from this.  Chronic
   respiratory acidosis of ?etiology, ?obesity hypoventilation.
   - Adjust vent prn for goal pCO2 high 50s-low 60s.
   - A line in place.
   .
   # HTN.
   - Hold antiHTNs for now.
   .
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on
   metabolism/gluconeogenesis?
   - D/c Glargine and cover with only sliding scale.
   - Start D10 at 30/hr and get q1hr finger sticks
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now comatose. The likely etiology of the arrest was hypoxia due to difficulties with mask ventilation and poor oxygen saturation prior to the event. Other possible causes, such as pulmonary embolism and air embolism, were ruled out.

The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with assisted control settings. A bronchoscopy was performed to remove a mucous plug. The patient's sputum culture came back contaminated, so it will be repeated. Antibiotics may be started if the patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values worsen.

The patient also had seizure-like activity, which was initially treated with IV ativan without significant change. The patient is currently on propofol and fentanyl for sedation. Continuous EEG monitoring will continue, and the neurology service will be consulted further.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and the etiology of acute renal failure (ARF) is unclear. The patient underwent continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT) in the past. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been initiated. Renal dosing of ceftriaxone and CVVHD with citrate are recommended"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   .
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on and poor O2 sat pleth prior to event.  Probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation
   - CT chest final read without evidence of air embolism, although
   atelectasis vs PNA found
   - CT head pending final read
   - Norepinephrine as a pressor.  Patient requiring this again starting
   at midnight
   - Continues on arctic sun protocol and 24 hour will be over today.
   - F/u consult service recs
   - Has not been getting Cisatracurium boluses any longer- no shivering;
   keep order written in case shivering occur again
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenating well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest.  Also,
   had an episode of desat yesterday to 73.  Was suctioned and bagged and
   improved.
   -Bronchoscopy today for mucous plug removal
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now
   -Send sputum for culture because first was contaminated
   -Possibly start antibiotics if ABG's worsen
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  On propofol; also given IV ativan
   x1 without significant change.
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today, so far no
   activity to suggest seizures
   - Neuro following.
   - Cooling as above.
   - Neuro recs MRI to further eval hypoxic injury to brain, can consider
   once pt stabilized and done with cooling
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - Renal recs

   - BK virus pending
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Respiratory acidosis.  Will now be able to correct with vent but
   unclear why has appeared to have this chronically.  One concern was
   lack of reliability of ABGs given past UE fistulas, but some ABG pH
   seem out of proportion to what expected if solely from this.  Chronic
   respiratory acidosis of ?etiology, ?obesity hypoventilation.
   - Adjust vent prn for goal pCO2 high 50s-low 60s.
   - A line in place.
   .
   # HTN.
   - Hold antiHTNs for now.
   .
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on
   metabolism/gluconeogenesis?
   - D/c Glargine and cover with only sliding scale.
   - Start D10 at 30/hr and get q1hr finger sticks
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently comatose. The likely etiology of the arrest is hypoxia, possibly related to difficulties keeping a mask on and poor oxygen saturation prior to the event. Other possible causes include acidosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), and air embolus. However, CT chest did not reveal evidence of air embolism, although atelectasis versus pneumonia (PNA) was found. CT head is pending final read.

The patient requires norepinephrine as a pressor starting at midnight. He continues on the Arctic Sun protocol and 24-hour cooling protocol. Fentanyl and propofol are being administered for sedation. An EEG is being monitored for seizure activity.

The patient has respiratory failure and is intubated due to arrest with likely hypoventilation-related hypoxia. There is some question of PNA on CT chest. A bronchoscopy is planned for mucous plug removal. Mechanical ventilation with assist-control (AC) settings is being used. Sputum culture will be sent because the initial culture was contaminated. Antibiotics may be started if ABG values worsen.

The patient may have experienced seizure activity versus myoclonus. He is on propofol and has been given IV ativan without significant"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and is currently comatose. The patient's medical history includes chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a previous continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT). He is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH-D) with citrate anticoagulation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 34.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/54 to 134/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with assisted control (AC) settings. The patient has been experiencing episodes of desaturation, and bronchoscopy has been performed for mucous plug removal. There is a possibility of pneumonia on the CT chest.

The patient is also on sedation with propofol and fentanyl, and seizure activity has been observed, which is being monitored with an electroencephalogram (EEG). Neurological recommendations include an MRI to evaluate hypoxic injury to the brain and the use of IV ativan for prolonged seizure activity.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from his current condition.

1. Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). This indicates that his kidneys are not functioning properly, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated and has a history of desaturation events. There is a concern for acute respiratory failure, although it is noted that there is no clear evidence of new infiltrate on imaging. This suggests that the patient's respiratory function may continue to be compromised.

3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and the cause remains unclear. The chest CT was negative for an air embolus. The patient is being rewarmed after therapeutic hypothermia, and the neurology team will re-evaluate the patient's neurological status. Further imaging modalities will be discussed with neurology.

4. Infections: The patient has a history of antibiotic use, including ceftriaxone, which may increase the risk of antibiotic-associated complications such as Clostridium difficile infection. Additionally, the patient is being held off on further antibiotics due to a pending urine culture"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced a cardiac arrest and is currently in the ICU. He has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 34.3°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/53 to 131/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. The patient has been sedated and unable to provide a history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PEA arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which is a type of cardiac arrest. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. There is no evidence of new infiltrates on imaging, so additional antibiotics may not be necessary at this time.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
4. Neurological Status: The patient's neurological status needs re-evaluation as he is sedated but showing some signs of responsiveness.
5. Infections: The patient has a central venous catheter (CVC) and may be at risk for central line-associated blood"

   61-year-old man with hx of renal transplant and ARF and CRF now
          s/p asystolic/PEA arrest
          Respiratory failure
          ARF on CVVHD
   We will await CT-h formal results and neurology recommendations, as
   well as EEG interpretation.  Examine off propofol today.
   For respiratory failure, continue CVVHD to keep slightly negative.  His
   vent pressures are higher then expected
 may be related to
   drive/dysynchroncy, tube malposition, etc.  Peak-plateau difference
   relatively high.  Trial of bronchodilators with measurements of
   resistance.
   For ARF, continue CVVHD with goal even to slightly negative.
   For anemia, follow for now.
   ID:  Not completely clear if there is infection.  Currently on Zosyn.
   For Pseudomonal culture in urine, discuss with transplant renal.  Zosyn
   adequate for now.  Although sinusitis is possible, as is pneumonia, we
   will hold off on treatment for now since culture negative and does not
   seem systemically infected at present.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of renal transplant and acute renal failure (ARF) who experienced a cardiac arrest and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He is currently in the ICU and is supported on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. The patient is also undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for ARF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 40%. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 100%. However, the plateau pressure is elevated at 29 cmH2O, indicating the potential risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. The healthcare team should carefully monitor the patient's lung compliance and consider adjusting the ventilator settings to minimize barotrauma.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of renal transplant and ARF. He is currently on CVVHD, which indicates the presence of renal dysfunction. The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 3.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is also increased. Close monitoring of renal function and ongoing management of AKI are essential to prevent further deterioration"

   Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular
   congestion and hilar enlargement developed acutely on [**11-15**] along
   with transient pleural effusions, documented by CT scanning. On
   [**11-17**], pulmonary vascular congestion had returned along with
   new consolidation at the base of the left lung. Small right pleural
   effusion has enlarged subsequently but the other findings are stable
   consistent with varying degrees of cardiac decompensation, not
   appreciably changed over 24 hours. ET tube is in standard placement and
   nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Left
   jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins, and a
   dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the mid
   and low right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pneumonia cannot be excluded but
   the simplest explanation is chronic mild cardiac decompensation and
   left lower lobe atelectasis.

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on, poor O2 sat pleth prior to event, and probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation
 CT chest
   and head without air embolism. Had worsening respiratory status several
   days ago after being moved to the R but improved this am.
    - Arctic sun is now off after 24hrs of being on
   - Will need to start waking him up more and checking his mental status
   - CT head [**11-17**] without any acute differences
   - Once stabilized could consider MRI to help guide prognostics
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenated well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Get CXR this am
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - Viral Cx from bronch yesterday was insufficient, if bronched again
   will need repeat Cx. Gstain and Ag screen were negative
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  On propofol and occasionally looks
   much worse off sedation and occasionally look OK, following commands
   and tracking.
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol
 Neuro recs yesterday to keep on
   Propofol and notify them if we are going to wean, and may need to be
   covered with Keppra if so.
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today
 did have
   some epileptiform activity on EEG 2d ago, but not outright seizures
   - Neuro following.
   - Neuro recs MRI to further eval hypoxic injury to brain, can consider
   once pt stabilized and done with cooling
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies
   - Were treating with Ceftriaxone before, but have changed to Zosyn,
   will d/c that and continue with the Zosyn that was started yesterday to
   cover for Pseudomonas.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative.
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - BK virus is negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   # Fluid filled sinus on CT: Started on Zosyn for this, but likely this
   is result of intubation and chronic, not really an acute infection.
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He subsequently experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) and is now comatose. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and has undergone continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. There is also a concern for pneumonia (PNA) based on imaging findings, although it has not been definitively confirmed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and is experiencing acute-on-chronic renal failure. The etiology of ARF is unclear at this time. He is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and will need ongoing management of his renal condition.
3. Cardiac Arrest: The patient experienced a sudden cardiac arrest, likely due to hypoxia, acidosis, or possibly a pulmonary embolism (PE) or air embolism. These events can have serious long-term consequences, including brain injury or death.
4. Infection: The patient has a positive urine culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating a urinary tract infection"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Nursing witnessed: 7:15am when propofol off, nurse noted R facial
   twitching and stiffening of body. Off sedation, pt noted to wiggle
   toes, open eyes, to command.
   - 8am Neuro resident noticed R facial twitching and L arm clonic
   movements, off propofol. Not typical movements for sz, and on EEG did
   not look like sz.
   - EEG without sz's, just epileptiform sharp features.
   - Neuro: [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] [**2083**] Jama article: if no spont eye movement today, has
   20% chance recovery with mod to severe disability. If does have spont
   eye movement, today has 75% chance recovery with mod disability.
   - Recs: Continue propofol for sedation bc has antiepileptic activities.
   If wean sedation, needs Keppra prophy. Will continue EEG. If sz
   activity push the button and record activity.
   - 4pm labs:
   - 7.29/53/152 on AC 400x22 40% PEEP 8 --> change to 400x24, 40%, PEEP 5
   with repeat ABG: 7.29/51/134/26 --> increased rr to 26
   - Neb trial didn't make much change in airway resistance
   - CXR [**11-18**]: chronic mild cardiac decompensations with LLL atelectasis.
   ""Varying degrees of cardiac decompensation"" over past several days (see
   CXR report)
   - f/[**Location 10843**] head --> no acute intracranial process
   - art line may need to be replaced soon
   - BCx with GPR's --> spoke with ID, watch identification of it, if
   corynebacterium not as worrisome but if clostridium needs to address
   - UCx Pseudomonas came back pan sensitive
   - 8pm I did off propofol neuro exam: Eyes open and upward deviated with
   R exotropia. Lips and periorbital muscles twitching L>R. Forward
   flexing at hip clonically. Bilateral arms outstretched but not rigid.
   No purposeful movements, not following commands at all. Unresponsive to
   voice or tactile stimulation. Pupils 3mm bilaterally with L slight
   constriction to light, none on R. Lots of drooling and trying to spit
   out oral airway, indicating intact gag reflex. Has corneal reflex.
   Couldn't elicit bilateral brachial, brachioradialis, patellar, or
   Achilles reflexes. Couldn't elicit Babinski's. Did withdraw to pain on
   R foot nailbed crushing, all other extrems none. During this, RT
   reported about 1 min of apnea.

   Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular
   congestion and hilar enlargement developed acutely on [**11-15**] along
   with transient pleural effusions, documented by CT scanning. On
   [**11-17**], pulmonary vascular congestion had returned along with
   new consolidation at the base of the left lung. Small right pleural
   effusion has enlarged subsequently but the other findings are stable
   consistent with varying degrees of cardiac decompensation, not
   appreciably changed over 24 hours. ET tube is in standard placement and
   nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Left
   jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins, and a
   dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the mid
   and low right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pneumonia cannot be excluded but
   the simplest explanation is chronic mild cardiac decompensation and
   left lower lobe atelectasis.

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Overnight notable for repeat exam off of propofol with hip and arm
   flexion, perioral twitching, also episode of apnea.  High PIPs
   possibly in setting of agitation
 now improved.  CT head repeated, and
   was unchanged.
   VS notable for Tm 100.  Remains on vent, AC 400 x 26 / 5/ 40%.
   Exam notable for withdrawal to pain b/l, eyes deviated L and up.
   Pupils ~2mm reactive L> ?R.
   Labs notable for Cr of 2.6.  Blood cx with GPC in 1 bottle.
   Meds include propofol, prednisone 5, mycophenylate, cefepime.
   Likely anoxic encephalopathy; minimal, if any progress neurologically.
   Will need to discuss c neurology whether further testing (eg MRI) would
   be helpful for further diagnosis or prognosis, and plan to discuss with
   the family.  In the meantime he will continue on full vent support,
   cefepime for UTI, CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently comatose. The patient's respiratory status has been worsening, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and anemia. The patient's condition is critical, and his prognosis is uncertain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and he is dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the ventilation settings are not optimized or if there is an underlying pneumonia.
2. Seizure Activity: The patient has shown signs of possible seizure activity or myoclonus. Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended to detect any epileptiform activity, and appropriate antiepileptic medications may be necessary.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, and his renal function is further compromised due to ARF. There is a risk of worsening renal failure, which could require renal replacement therapy such as continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH).
4. Infection: The patient has a UTI caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and there is a possibility of other infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and imaging studies"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Nursing witnessed: 7:15am when propofol off, nurse noted R facial
   twitching and stiffening of body. Off sedation, pt noted to wiggle
   toes, open eyes, to command.
   - 8am Neuro resident noticed R facial twitching and L arm clonic
   movements, off propofol. Not typical movements for sz, and on EEG did
   not look like sz.
   - EEG without sz's, just epileptiform sharp features.
   - Neuro: [**Doctor Last Name 2576**] [**2083**] Jama article: if no spont eye movement today, has
   20% chance recovery with mod to severe disability. If does have spont
   eye movement, today has 75% chance recovery with mod disability.
   - Recs: Continue propofol for sedation bc has antiepileptic activities.
   If wean sedation, needs Keppra prophy. Will continue EEG. If sz
   activity push the button and record activity.
   - 4pm labs:
   - 7.29/53/152 on AC 400x22 40% PEEP 8 --> change to 400x24, 40%, PEEP 5
   with repeat ABG: 7.29/51/134/26 --> increased rr to 26
   - Neb trial didn't make much change in airway resistance
   - CXR [**11-18**]: chronic mild cardiac decompensations with LLL atelectasis.
   ""Varying degrees of cardiac decompensation"" over past several days (see
   CXR report)
   - f/[**Location 10843**] head --> no acute intracranial process
   - art line may need to be replaced soon
   - BCx with GPR's --> spoke with ID, watch identification of it, if
   corynebacterium not as worrisome but if clostridium needs to address
   - UCx Pseudomonas came back pan sensitive
   - 8pm I did off propofol neuro exam: Eyes open and upward deviated with
   R exotropia. Lips and periorbital muscles twitching L>R. Forward
   flexing at hip clonically. Bilateral arms outstretched but not rigid.
   No purposeful movements, not following commands at all. Unresponsive to
   voice or tactile stimulation. Pupils 3mm bilaterally with L slight
   constriction to light, none on R. Lots of drooling and trying to spit
   out oral airway, indicating intact gag reflex. Has corneal reflex.
   Couldn't elicit bilateral brachial, brachioradialis, patellar, or
   Achilles reflexes. Couldn't elicit Babinski's. Did withdraw to pain on
   R foot nailbed crushing, all other extrems none. During this, RT
   reported about 1 min of apnea.
   - Later in the evening talked to family
   - Unclear why Cefepime was started, will need clarification in the am.

   IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-15**] through 12:
   Moderate to severe cardiomegaly is chronic. Pulmonary vascular
   congestion and hilar enlargement developed acutely on [**11-15**] along
   with transient pleural effusions, documented by CT scanning. On
   [**11-17**], pulmonary vascular congestion had returned along with
   new consolidation at the base of the left lung. Small right pleural
   effusion has enlarged subsequently but the other findings are stable
   consistent with varying degrees of cardiac decompensation, not
   appreciably changed over 24 hours. ET tube is in standard placement and
   nasogastric tube passes below the diaphragm and out of view.  Left
   jugular line ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins, and a
   dual-channel right supraclavicular central venous line ends in the mid
   and low right atrium. No pneumothorax. Pneumonia cannot be excluded but
   the simplest explanation is chronic mild cardiac decompensation and
   left lower lobe atelectasis.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on, poor O2 sat pleth prior to event, and probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation
 CT chest
   and head without air embolism. Had worsening respiratory status several
   days ago after being moved to the R but improved this am.
   - Arctic sun is now off after 24hrs of being on
   - Will need to have a meeting with neuro to come to consensus about
   pt
s prognosis so that we can present this information to family and
   have them decide what their goals of care are.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined
   - If family decides for CMO will withdraw care
   - If family decides otherwise, will have to start to think about trach
   tube, PEG tube, and placement.
   - Could consider MRI to help guide prognostics, would f/u this with
   Neuro though
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenated well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Get CXR this am
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - As above for overall goals of care
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. On propofol and occasionally looks
   much worse off sedation but per others reports, occasionally looks OK,
   following commands and tracking. I have not seen this to be the case at
   all.
   - As above re: goals of care
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol Neuro recs yesterday to keep on
   Propofol and notify them if we are going to wean, and may need to be
   covered with Keppra if so.
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today
 did have
   some epileptiform activity on EEG 2d ago, but not outright seizures
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies
   - Was being treated with Ceftriaxone, but then yesterday started on
   Zosyn, now switched to Cefipime. Continue as is.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative.
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - BK virus is negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   # Fluid filled sinus on CT: Started on Zosyn for this, but likely this
   is result of intubation and chronic, not really an acute infection. We
   will not treat for this, but rather for UCx with Pseudomonas
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on
   metabolism/gluconeogenesis? Glargine was d/c
d and pt covered only with
   SSI and given some D10, with q1hr fingersticks.
   - BS

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently comatose after experiencing a cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's recent events include nursing witnessing right facial twitching and stiffening of the body when propofol was turned off, indicating possible seizure activity. A neuro resident also observed right facial twitching and left arm clonic movements, which were not typical for seizures and did not show any signs of seizure activity on EEG. The neuro resident noted that the patient's lack of spontaneous eye movement today carries a 20% chance of recovery with moderate to severe disability, but if the patient does have spontaneous eye movement, there is a 75% chance of recovery with moderate disability. It was recommended to continue propofol for sedation due to its antiepileptic properties.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure of 101/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with assist-control settings. A chest X-ray showed moderate to severe cardiomegaly and"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on, poor O2 sat pleth prior to event, and probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation of CT chest
   and head without air embolism. Had worsening respiratory status several
   days ago after being moved to the R but improved this am.
   - Will need to have a meeting with neuro to come to consensus about
   pt
s prognosis so that we can present this information to family and
   have them decide what their goals of care are.  Family meeting with
   Neuro at 1pm on Monday.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; patient very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - If family decides for CMO will withdraw care
   - If family decides otherwise, will have to start to think about trach
   tube, PEG tube, and placement.
   - Could consider MRI to help guide prognostics, would f/u this with
   Neuro though
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenated well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Get CXR this am
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - As above for overall goals of care
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. On propofol and occasionally looks
   much worse off sedation (seizure-like activity and agitation)
   - As above re: goals of care
   - Currently on Fentanyl and Propofol Neuro recs yesterday to keep on
   Propofol and notify them if we are going to wean, and may need to be
   covered with Keppra if so.
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today
 did have
   some epileptiform activity on EEG 2d ago, but not outright seizures
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.

   # Fluid filled sinus on CT: Started on Zosyn for this, but likely this
   is result of intubation and chronic, not really an acute infection. We
   will not treat for this, but rather for UCx with Pseudomonas

   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and recent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The patient was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently comatose and in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 164/63 to 196/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with assisted control settings.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention. Firstly, there is a new blood culture positive for gram-negative rods, which may indicate a potential bloodstream infection. Secondly, the patient's urine culture is positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, suggesting a urinary tract infection (UTI). Thirdly, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to the recent ARF. Fourthly, there is a fluid-filled sinus seen on the CT scan, possibly related to intubation. Fifthly, the patient has uncontrolled blood sugars due to DM type II. Lastly, the patient has chronic anemia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently comatose. The likely etiology of the PEA arrest was hypoxia due to difficulties in keeping a mask on, poor oxygen saturation, and potential hypoxic conditions during medication administration. Other possible causes such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and air embolus were considered but ruled out through CT chest and head without air embolism. The patient's respiratory status improved after being moved back to the regular room.

The patient's overall goals of care need to be determined by a family meeting with the neurologist. Sedation and ventilation will not be weaned until the goals are established, as the patient is agitated with attempts to wean. If the family decides for comfort measures only (CMO), care will be withdrawn. If otherwise, tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes may be considered.

The patient has respiratory failure with intubation during the arrest, possibly due to hypoventilation-related hypoxia. There is a question of pneumonia on CT chest, and the patient has had chest X-rays with left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. A new bronchoscopy was unrevealing, and cultures gathered.

The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on, poor O2 sat pleth prior to event, and probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation of CT chest
   and head without air embolism. Had worsening respiratory status several
   days ago after being moved to the R but improved this am.
   - Will need to have a meeting with neuro to come to consensus about
   pt
s prognosis so that we can present this information to family and
   have them decide what their goals of care are.  Family meeting with
   Neuro at 1pm on Monday.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; patient very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - If family decides for CMO will withdraw care
   - If family decides otherwise, will have to start to think about trach
   tube, PEG tube, and placement.
   - Could consider MRI to help guide prognostics, would f/u this with
   Neuro though
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenated well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Get CXR this am
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - As above for overall goals of care
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. On propofol and occasionally looks
   much worse off sedation (seizure-like activity and agitation)
   - As above re: goals of care
   - Currently on Fentanyl and
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today. did have
   some epileptiform activity on EEG earlier, but not outright seizures
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   -Need to have them leave a note today about: whether he is seizing, med
   recs, and imaging recs.
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies
   - Was being treated with Ceftriaxone, but then yesterday started on
   Zosyn, now switched to Cefipime. Continue as is.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative.
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - BK virus is negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Fluid filled sinus on CT: Started on Zosyn for this, but likely this
   is result of intubation and chronic, not really an acute infection. We
   will not treat for this, but rather for UCx with Pseudomonas
   .
   # DM type II. Has had persistently low blood sugars through admission
   yesterday. Possibly due to cooling effect and effects on
   metabolism/gluconeogenesis? Glargine was d/c
d and pt covered only with
   SSI and given some D10, with q1hr fingersticks.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently comatose and on mechanical ventilation with assisted control settings. He has been treated with multiple antibiotics for suspected infections, including a new blood culture positive for gram-positive rods. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and is being treated with cefepime. He has acute on chronic renal failure and is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The patient has a fluid-filled sinus on CT, which is likely related to intubation. His diabetes is managed with subcutaneous short-acting insulin (SSI). The patient is anemic, possibly due to chronic kidney disease or anemia of chronic disease (ACD). The patient's code status is full code, and his access lines include peripheral IVs, left internal jugular (IJ) tunneled catheter for long-term dialysis, and right IJ hemodialysis line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about possible pneumonia (PNA) and the need for a tracheostomy"

   Physical Examination
   Off of propofol this morning the patient was able to follow some basic
   commands like squeezing hands, moving both feet.  He would not open and
   close his eyes but did appear to be tracking.  He appeared to be
   coughing but did not show any activity suspicious for seizures.  On
   lung exam he has coarse central breathing sounds.  Heart slightly tachy
   but regular.  Abdomen soft, NTND.  RUE swelling is stable, LE with
   wrinkled skin but improved edema.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has dramatically
   worsened mental status after a PEA arrest [**11-15**].  However, his
   neurologic status seems to be significantly improved today, though it
   is unclear what level of recovery he can have.  He had a negative n/c
   head CT but has not had an MRI.  His EEG reads are mostly pending.
   - We need to have a family meeting to discuss prognosis with
   neurology.  That could not be done today at 1pm because no one was
   available from the neurology team.  We are re-scheduling for 4pm
   tomorrow.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; he has been very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - will get an MRI head w/o contrast today to assess for ischemic
   damage.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  .  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had
   CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has
   PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - Will not wean aggressively until we know goals of care, which should
   hopefully happen tomorrow.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.
   - First dialysis session planned for tomorrow.
   - BK virus and CMV negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Now day 4 of 7.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has R>L swelling.  U/S could not completely
   visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will continue to

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in a comatose state.

The patient's mental status has significantly improved today, but it is unclear what level of recovery he can achieve. His neurological status is being assessed through EEG monitoring, and an MRI head without contrast has been ordered to evaluate for ischemic damage.

The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to intubation during the arrest, and there is some question of pneumonia on chest CT and CXRs showing left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. A bronchoscopic evaluation of the airways (bronch) did not reveal any significant findings.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure and has undergone continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). He can now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis, with the first session planned for tomorrow. The etiology of ARF is still unclear. The patient has tested negative for BK virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV).

The patient's seizure activity or myoclonus is being monitored through EEG, and there are pending results. Treatment for prolonged seizure activity may include IV ativan.

The patient has a new blood culture positive for gram-positive rods, which could potentially indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # s/p PEA arrest.  Likely etiology is hypoxia given difficulties with
   keeping mask on, poor O2 sat pleth prior to event, and probably hypoxic
   in setting of getting meds for procedure.  Also could be acidosis
   related (has acute on chronic respiratory acidosis).  Also considered
   PE and air embolus, although neither revealed in evaluation of CT chest
   and head without air embolism. Had worsening respiratory status several
   days ago after being moved to the R but improved this am.
   - Will need to have a meeting with neuro to come to consensus about
   pt
s prognosis so that we can present this information to family and
   have them decide what their goals of care are.  Family meeting with
   Neuro at 1pm on Monday.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; patient very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - If family decides for CMO will withdraw care
   - If family decides otherwise, will have to start to think about trach
   tube, PEG tube, and placement.
   - Could consider MRI to help guide prognostics, would f/u this with
   Neuro though
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with ?hypoxia
   beforehand.  Seemingly hypoventilation related hypoxia as above.
   Oxygenated well on code ABG.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Get CXR this am
   - Mechanical vent with AC settings for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - As above for overall goals of care
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. On propofol and occasionally looks
   much worse off sedation (seizure-like activity and agitation)
   - As above re: goals of care
   - Continue EEG monitoring and touch base with Neuro today. did have
   some epileptiform activity on EEG earlier, but not outright seizures
   - Neuro also recs: don't treat posturing with benzos, if concern for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   -Need to have them leave a note today about: whether he is seizing, med
   recs, and imaging recs.
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies
   - Was being treated with Ceftriaxone, but then yesterday started on
   Zosyn, now switched to Cefipime. Continue as is.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  CMV negative.
   - Currently getting CVVH
   - BK virus is negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.

   #RUE swelling: possible DVT
   -U/S to r/o DVT

   #Constipation and distention:
   - suppository and possible enema if not having bowel movement

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.

2. The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and renal failure. He is unresponsive to verbal and tactile stimuli but shows some withdrawal to pain. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 152/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

3. The patient has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation with assist-control settings. He is also receiving propofol for sedation.

4. The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. Other lab values such as white blood cell count, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

5. Imaging studies reveal a stable retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray (CXR) and no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity. However, there is an ETT (endotracheal tube) that appears to be too low.

6. Microbiology cultures have grown Gram-positive rods, but the species has not been specified yet.

7. The patient's goals of care are pending consensus between the medical team and the family. A family meeting with the neurologist is scheduled to discuss the patient's prognosis.

8. The patient has several ongoing issues that require attention, including possible seizure activity, agitation, and weaning off sedation and ventilation. His overall goals of care need to be determined before any further management decisions can be made.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Prolonged respiratory failure and associated complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

2. Renal failure may worsen, leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.

3. There is a risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering the patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest.

4. The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium or coma, affecting his overall prognosis and ability to interact with healthcare providers.

5. Seizure activity or myoclonus may continue, requiring appropriate management and monitoring.

6. Infection control measures should be implemented to prevent healthcare-associated infections, particularly given the presence of indwelling lines and catheters.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function"

   His neurologic exam has substantively improved, and he now reproducibly
   follows commands though does not seem fully alert.  We will discuss
   with neurology, pursue MRI if helpful, and discuss with family.  The
   improvement in exam suggests substantial uncertainty and that
   meaningful recovery is not excluded.
   Since we will likely pursue MRI, will leave intubated for now.  He has
   had multiple challenges relating to sedation/hypoxemia, so will be
   relatively conservative in pursuing extubation trials.
   Agree with renal that converting from continuous to intermittent
   dialysis seems appropriate.
   Watch blood cultures.  Suspect contaminant (e.g. corynebacterium), but
   reculture and consider rx if spikes.

   children.  Current status, including his improvement in exam, reviewed,
   as well as the fact that substantial uncertainty exists about prognosis
 ranging from significant chronic brain damage to meaningful
   recovery.  All questions answered.  They are particularly interested in
   clearly understanding the events that led up to his cardiac arrest.
   Because of work issues, though, several of them had to leave to go to
   work and could not stay until IR and renal attendings were available.
   We will therefore reschedule for 4pm tomorrow to review events leading
   up to arrest.  In addition, we have consulted SW to assist with coping,
   disability insurance forms, visas for out-of-country relatives, etc.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of renal transplant, admitted with acute renal failure (ARF) and now experiencing respiratory failure following a cardiac arrest. The patient underwent CPR for 13 minutes and was treated with a hypothermia protocol. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His neurologic exam has improved, but he does not seem fully alert. The attending physician plans to discuss further management with neurology and pursue an MRI if necessary. The patient's blood culture shows a pan-sensitive UTI, and there is a suspicion of contaminant, so reculture and consider treatment if spikes. The patient is also on intermittent dialysis, and his lines are being monitored for potential complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring due to the previous cardiac arrest and subsequent respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which can be prevented by maintaining proper head of bed elevation, performing mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and monitoring respiratory system infection probability (RSBI).
2. Infection: The presence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated by the blood culture suggests a risk of infection. Monitoring for any signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment will be important.
3. Neurological complications: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest and encephalopathy, there is a possibility of neurological complications such as stroke or brain damage. Regular neurologic"

   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.
   - Family meeting at 4pm today to discuss events surrounding PEA arrest
   [**11-15**] and neurological prognosis.
   - Very agitated with weaning of sedation.  We will wean periodically to
   assess mental status and ability to wean ventilator, but otherwise
   should keep him comfortable for the rest of today.
   - Limit fentanyl to boluses per neurology recommendations to avoid
   lowering seizure threshold.
   - f/u final neurology recs.
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling
   Urinary source seems less likely.  Pancreatitis is possible given
   prolonged sedation with propofol.  He did have a positive blood culture
   for gram positive rods on [**11-15**] that has not been speciated.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Discuss with renal and family about changing dialysis catheter site
   and replacing triple lumen
 possibly femoral site.
   - Check lipase for possible pancreatitis and other LFTs.
   - f/u speciation of GPR
s in blood culture
   - add on diff to this morning
s CBC
   - check lactate
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now weaning as tolerated.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.  Dialysis was planned for
   today, but he may not tolerate it due to hypotension.
   - BK virus and CMV negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Was day 5 of 7, but will likely continue further
   b/c of new hypotension and fevers.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has stable R>L swelling.  U/S could not
   completely visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will
   continue to monitor.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest (PEA arrest) and is currently comatose. The patient's medical history includes chronic renal failure, hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD). 

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status following the PEA arrest, respiratory failure, hypotension, and acute kidney injury. The altered mental status is being monitored, and the patient is being sedated periodically to assess mental status and ability to wean from the ventilator. 

The hypotension is believed to be hypovolemic in origin due to excessive fluid removal or infectious causes. The patient has a fever and is on cefepime for a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). No infectious source has been identified on the chest X-ray, and there is concern about the possibility of a line infection given the multiple lines in place. 

The respiratory failure is attributed to the intubation during the cardiac arrest, with possible hypoxia beforehand. There is some question about the presence of pneumonia on the CT chest and previous chest X-rays showing left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. 

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure and is planned for intermittent dialysis. The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear. 

There is also mention of possible seizure activity"

   Physical Examination
   Off of yesterday the patient was able to follow some basic commands
   like squeezing hands, moving both feet.  He would not open and close
   his eyes but did appear to be tracking.   This morning he is writhing
   in bed, moving all extremities spontaneously.  On lung exam he has
   coarse central breathing sounds.  Heart slightly tachy but regular w/
   IV/VI systolic murmur.  Abdomen soft, NTND.  RUE swelling is stable, LE
   with wrinkled skin but improved edema.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has dramatically
   worsened mental status after a PEA arrest [**11-15**].  However, his
   neurologic status seems to be significantly improved today, making
   meaningful recovery far more likely.  He had a negative n/c head CT but
   has not had an MRI.  His EEG reads have not shown clear seizure
   activity.
   - We need to have a family meeting to discuss prognosis with
   neurology.  That could not be done today at 1pm because no one was
   available from the neurology team.  We are re-scheduling for 4pm
   tomorrow.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; he has been very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - will get an MRI head w/o contrast today to assess for ischemic
   damage.
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling
   Urinary source seems less likely.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  .  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had
   CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has
   PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - Will not wean aggressively until we know goals of care, which should
   hopefully happen tomorrow.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.
   - First dialysis session planned for tomorrow.
   - BK virus and CMV negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Now day 4 of 7.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has R>L swelling.  U/S could not completely
   visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, will cautiously restart tube feeds
   given vomiting yesterday.  Has not had elevated residuals.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, resulting in altered mental status. 

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, cardiac arrest, and an altered mental status post PEA arrest. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics for a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI). There is also a new blood culture showing Gram-positive rods, which could indicate a new infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis or septic shock is crucial.

2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and acute on chronic renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is essential. Dialysis sessions are planned for tomorrow.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is on assisted control ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging given the patient's agitation when sedation and ventilation are reduced. Regular assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient had a cardiac arrest and has a history of HTN and DM, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Monitoring for signs of heart failure"

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest and comatose
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has dramatically
   worsened mental status after a PEA arrest [**11-15**].  However, his
   neurologic status seems to be significantly improved today, making
   meaningful recovery far more likely.  He had a negative n/c head CT but
   has not had an MRI.  His EEG reads have not shown clear seizure
   activity.
   - We need to have a family meeting to discuss prognosis with
   neurology.  That could not be done today at 1pm because no one was
   available from the neurology team.  We are re-scheduling for 4pm
   tomorrow.
   - Will not actively start to wean sedation or ventilation until greater
   overall goals of care are determined; he has been very agitated with
   attempts to wean
   - will get an MRI head w/o contrast today to assess for ischemic
   damage.
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, does have
   multiple lines.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  .  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had
   CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has
   PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now. Has elevated airway
   pressures and airway resistance did not resolve with neb trail
   - Will not wean aggressively until we know goals of care, which should
   hopefully happen tomorrow.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.
   - First dialysis session planned for tomorrow.
   - BK virus and CMV negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   # New BCx with Gram Positive Rods: Unclear which bacteria this could
   be, not a common infection to have blood [**Location (un) **]. Will await speciation
   and sensitivity to decide if we have to treat or call this a
   contaminant.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Now day 4 of 7.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has R>L swelling.  U/S could not completely
   visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will continue to
   monitor.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, will cautiously restart tube feeds
   given vomiting yesterday.  Has not had elevated residuals.

   Off of propofol this morning the patient was able to follow some basic
   commands like squeezing hands, moving both feet.  He would not open and
   close his eyes but did appear to be tracking.  He appeared to be
   coughing but did not show any activity suspicious for seizures.  On
   lung exam he has coarse central breathing sounds.  Heart slightly tachy
   but regular.  Abdomen soft, NTND.  RUE swelling is stable, LE with
   wrinkled skin but improved edema.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea, acute renal failure (ARF), and now post-cardiac arrest in a comatose state. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be closely monitored and managed. These include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient experienced a significant change in mental status following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Although there seems to be some improvement in his neurologic status, the extent of recovery is uncertain. An MRI head without contrast is planned to assess for any ischemic damage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated due to respiratory failure, which occurred during the cardiac arrest and possibly before that. There is some question about the presence of pneumonia (PNA) on the CT chest, and the CXR shows left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. Further evaluation is needed to determine if the patient truly has PNA or not.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, likely due to the recent cardiac arrest. The etiology of acute renal failure (ARF) is unclear. Adequate volume removal with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) has been achieved, and the patient can now transition to intermittent dialysis."

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss
   events surrounding PEA arrest.
   - Very agitated with weaning of sedation.  We will wean periodically to
   assess mental status and ability to wean ventilator, but otherwise
   should keep him comfortable for the rest of today.
   - Neurololgy recommended fentanyl boluses, but patient did not
   tolerated well.  Keep on fenatanyl drip for now.
   - Neurology continues to follow patient with daily exams off propofol.
   Will continue to f/u any recs they have.
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines which have been continuously contaminated with
   salivations.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary
   source seems less likely. Lipase was negative, so not likely
   pancreatitis.  Did have a positive blood culture for gram positive rods
   on [**11-15**] that was not able to be speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get peripheral access
   - Differential from yesterday showed eosinophilia, will recheck this
   morning
   - Also, may need to have ART replaced for better monitoring
   .
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so are likely the source.  His lipase was WNL, so
   pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider drug fever if not
   improved with line removal.
   - talk to family about removing and replacing lines
   - if lines will be replaced, can do VIP and PICC so nurses have 2
   ports.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now weaning as tolerated.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.  No report yet this
   morning regarding whether or not he will be dialyzed.  BK virus and CMV
   negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Was day 6of 7, but will likely continue further
   b/c of new hypotension and fevers.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has stable R>L swelling.  U/S could not
   completely visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: peripherals, L IJ TLC, R IJ HD line -> may need to be replaced
   considering patient drooling.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's condition:

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, but there are signs of improvement, suggesting a potential meaningful recovery. However, the MRI was limited by motion artifact, and no signs of acute ischemia were observed.
- The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemia or infection. There is a concern about line infections, as multiple lines have been continuously contaminated with salivations. The patient has an allergy to vancomycin, so alternative antibiotics will be used.
- The patient's fever is ongoing, and the source of infection remains unclear. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found in the urine culture, but it could be a contaminant. The IJ lines appear infected, so they may need to be removed and replaced.
- The patient is intubated and on assist control ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is some uncertainty regarding the presence of pneumonia.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated acutely on top of chronic renal failure. The etiology of ARF is unclear, and the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  Family meeting yesterday to discuss
   events surrounding PEA arrest.
   - Very agitated with weaning of sedation.  We will wean periodically to
   assess mental status and ability to wean ventilator, but otherwise
   should keep him comfortable for the rest of today.
   - Neurololgy recommended fentanyl boluses, but patient did not
   tolerated well.  Keep on fenatanyl drip for now.
   - Neurology continues to follow patient with daily exams off propofol.
   Will continue to f/u any recs they have.
   .
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines which have been continuously contaminated with
   salivations.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary
   source seems less likely. Lipase was negative, so not likely
   pancreatitis.  Did have a positive blood culture for gram positive rods
   on [**11-15**] that was not able to be speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get peripheral access
   - Differential from yesterday showed eosinophilia, will recheck this
   morning
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now weaning as tolerated.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  He has had adequate volume removed with CVVH and can
   now be transitioned to intermittent dialysis.  No report yet this
   morning regarding whether or not he will be dialyzed.  BK virus and CMV
   negative
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Was day 56of 7, but will likely continue further
   b/c of new hypotension and fevers.
   .
   #RUE swelling: Patient has stable R>L swelling.  U/S could not
   completely visualize subclavian vein, but clot seems unlikely.  Will
   continue to monitor.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: peripherals, L IJ TLC, R IJ HD line -> may need to be replaced

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM) admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently comatose.
- MRI shows chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old left frontal encephalomalacia but no signs of acute infarct.
- Extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease.
- The patient has multiple lines, including an endotracheal tube, left internal jugular (IJ) line, and right IJ line.
- Urine culture shows Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to cefepime and meropenem.
- Blood culture shows gram-positive rods that have not been speciated.
- The patient has been treated with cefepime, linezolid, and heparin.
- The patient's mental status exam is reassuring, but he remains comatose.
- There are concerns about hypotension, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, possible pancreatitis, and seizure activity.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further evaluation of pending tests and cultures.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced a cardiac arrest during hemodialysis line placement and was admitted for acute renal failure in the setting of renal transplantation. The patient has shown meaningful neurological recovery with reassuring MRI findings. However, the main present issues include fever, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and potential line infections may lead to sepsis, which can be a life-threatening condition.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory support and low oxygen saturation levels indicate respiratory failure. This could be due to various causes such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or aspiration.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure requires renal replacement therapy. AKI can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for ongoing dialysis support.

4. Cardiovascular complications: Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest, there is a risk of cardiovascular complications such as arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, or heart failure.

5. Infection control: The presence of multiple lines and catheters increases the risk of healthcare-associated infections, including bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

6. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and other complications.

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old man s/p cardiac arrest during HD line placement in IR,
   after admission for ARF in setting of renal transplant.  He has shown
   meaningful neurological recovery, with a reassuring (if limited) MRI.
   Main present issues are fever, respiratory failure, and ARF requiring
   renal replacement therapy.
   Most likely source of fever is lines.  See my note from yesterday
   regarding decisionmaking.  I think they need to be removed and resited
   today.  Given prior events, will call Mrs. [**Known lastname 10044**] and review potential
   options.  I favor travel to I.R. and femoral HD with VIP port, plus
   PICC if possible.  Alternative would be fem HD and fem TLC placement in
   ICU, but may be complex given his many prior vascular issues.  He is in
   a safer position now, since he is intubated.
   Otherwise, continue present antibiotics and follow cultures.
   Once lines in place, will try topical anesth for ET tube irritation,
   weaning propofol, and SBT assessment.
   Will probably need dialysis today or tomorrow.
   Other issues as per ICU team note today.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced a cardiac arrest during hemodialysis line placement in the intensive care unit (ICU). He has shown meaningful neurological recovery but is currently dealing with fever, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF) requiring renal replacement therapy.

The patient has several medical issues, including allergies to vancomycin, hypertension, and prior vascular problems. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device. His vital signs indicate a fever of 101.6°F, hypertension with blood pressure readings ranging from 162/67 mmHg to 178/94 mmHg, heart rate between 84 and 112 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19-32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, C-reactive protein, and lactate levels. His blood cultures are pending, and other lab values such as glucose, electrolytes, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include the removal and resiting of central lines due to suspected line-associated infection, travel to the interventional radiology department for femoral hemodialysis with a vascular insertion portal (VIP) port, and placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line if possible. The alternative option is femoral"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  His physical exam off sedation is
   inconsistent though, with some seeing meaningful, purposeful actions,
   following commands, and others just seeing agitation and no purposeful
   movements.
   - Continues on Fentanyl gtt. Neuro recommended boluses but did not
   tolerate well so will continue with gtt now but will try to wean down.
   Also continues on Propofol gtt and and Versed boluses
 will d/c Versed
   boluses. Overall the plan will be to go down on the Fentanyl as
   tolerated and try to use the Propofol more.
   - Plan was also to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate
   the ETT tube, but per respiratory that didn't help much
   - Will continue to periodically wean him from sedation and assess
   mental status for continued improvement
   - F/u Neurology recs, they feel he is making improvements, with 75%
   chance recovery with moderate disability
   # Hypertension: Pt was having issues with hypotension due to either
   hypovolemia vs infectious source, but now issue is hypertension and he
   has been started on Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]. He continues to be
   hypertense this morning with BP's getting up to the 200's.
   - Increase Labetalol as necessary
   - Will speak with pharmacy about the potential for interaction between
   Propofol and Linezolid causing increased BP
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so were likely the source, and have been replaced.  His
   lipase was WNL, so pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider
   drug fever if not improved with line removal.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   - Continues on Cefepime and Linezolid
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will do RSBI / SBT today
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  BK virus and CMV negative. He was getting CVVH, then
   the plan was to stop and get IHD, but was restarted back on CVVH
   yesterday after getting new lines placed. Don't feel that we need to be
   as aggressive with fluid removal as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Will continue CVVH through today but can continue to speak with renal
   about when we could start HD
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines which have been continuously contaminated with
   salivations.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary
   source seems less likely. Lipase was negative, so not likely
   pancreatitis.  Did have a positive blood culture for gram positive rods
   on [**11-15**] that was not able to be speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get peripheral access
   - Differential from yesterday showed eosinophilia, will recheck this
   morning
   - Also, may need to have ART replaced for better monitoring
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac arrest. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, renal failure, hypertension, and fever.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors including the recent cardiac arrest, sedation, and possible encephalopathy. The patient's MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia, and his EEG readings have not shown clear seizure activity. The plan is to wean the patient off sedation gradually and assess his mental status for continued improvement.

The patient's respiratory failure is being managed with assist-control ventilation. There is some uncertainty regarding the presence of pneumonia (PNA) on the patient's chest X-ray, which showed left lower lobe atelectasis. Bronchoscopic evaluation was unrevealing, and cultures are pending.

The patient's acute-on-chronic renal failure is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear, but BK virus and cytomegalovirus (CMV) have been ruled out. The patient's elevated PTH levels are likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal failure.

The patient's fever is being investigated, with infectious work-ups being largely unrevealing. The patient had pseudomonas in his urine and gram-positive"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  His physical exam off sedation is
   inconsistent though, with some seeing meaningful, purposeful actions,
   following commands, and others just seeing agitation and no purposeful
   movements.
   - Continues on Fentanyl gtt. Neuro recommended boluses but did not
   tolerate well so will continue with gtt now but will try to wean down.
   Also continues on Propofol gtt and and Versed boluses
 will d/c Versed
   boluses. Overall the plan will be to go down on the Fentanyl as
   tolerated and try to use the Propofol more.
   - Plan was also to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate
   the ETT tube, but per respiratory that didn't help much
   - Will continue to periodically wean him from sedation and assess
   mental status for continued improvement
   - F/u Neurology recs, they feel he is making improvements, with 75%
   chance recovery with moderate disability
   # Hypertension: Pt was having issues with hypotension due to either
   hypovolemia vs infectious source, but now issue is hypertension and he
   has been started on Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]. He continues to be
   hypertense this morning with BP's getting up to the 200's.
   - Increase Labetalol as necessary
   - Will speak with pharmacy about the potential for interaction between
   Propofol and Linezolid causing increased BP
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so were likely the source, and have been replaced.  His
   lipase was WNL, so pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider
   drug fever if not improved with line removal.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   - Continues on Cefepime and Linezolid
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will do RSBI / SBT today
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  BK virus and CMV negative. He was getting CVVH, then
   the plan was to stop and get IHD, but was restarted back on CVVH
   yesterday after getting new lines placed. Don't feel that we need to be
   as aggressive with fluid removal as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Will continue CVVH through today but can continue to speak with renal
   about when we could start HD
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # Hypotension: This has been less of an issue in the most recent past
   as pt is now hypertense. It is worth leaving on the problem list though
   because he was recently having significant hypotension, etiology likely
   hypovolemic (17 liters negative length of stay, which may be too much)
   vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.
   No infectious source on CXR, and he does have multiple lines which have
   been continuously contaminated with salivations.  It is especially
   worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary source seems less likely.
   Lipase was negative, so not likely pancreatitis.  Did have a positive
   blood culture for gram positive rods on [**11-15**] that was not able to be
   speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line,
   which has been done.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get PICC
   - Also, may need to have ART replaced for better monitoring
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease, old left frontal encephalomalacia, extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease, and chronic anemia. The patient was admitted with dyspnea, acute renal failure (ARF), and now suffered a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient has several ongoing medical complications including altered mental status, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, hypertension, fever, urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible line infection. 

The patient's vital signs show an increased body temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 104 to 166 mmHg, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving assist control ventilation. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and C-reactive protein (CRP). The patient also has elevated levels of glucose, amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase, and troponin-T. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, while calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  His physical exam off sedation is
   inconsistent though, with some seeing meaningful, purposeful actions,
   following commands, and others just seeing agitation and no purposeful
   movements.
   - Continues on Fentanyl gtt. Neuro recommended boluses but did not
   tolerate well so will continue with gtt now.
   - Also continues on Propofol gtt and and Versed boluses
   - Plan was also to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate
   the ETT tube, but per respiratory that didn't help much
   - Will continue to periodically wean him from sedation and assess
   mental status for continued improvement
   - F/u Neurology recs, they feel he is making improvements, with 75%
   chance recovery with moderate disability
   # Hypertension: Pt was having issues with hypotension due to either
   hypovolemia vs infectious source, but now issue is hypertension and he
   has been started on Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]. He continues to be
   hypertense this morning with BP's getting up to the 200's.
   - Increase Labetalol as necessary
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so were likely the source, and have been replaced.  His
   lipase was WNL, so pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider
   drug fever if not improved with line removal.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   - Continues on Cefepime and Linezolid
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now weaning as tolerated.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  BK virus and CMV negative. He was getting CVVH, then
   the plan was to stop and get IHD, but was restarted back on CVVH
   yesterday after getting new lines placed. Don't feel that we need to be
   as aggressive with fluid removal as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Will continue CVVH through today but can continue to speak with renal
   about when we could start HD
   # Elevated PTH: with resultant hypercalcemia. Originally thought to be
   due to Ca infusions with CVVH but PTH is clearly elevated
   - Endo consult
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # Hypotension: etiology likely hypovolemic (17 liters negative length
   of stay, which may be too much) vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On
   Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.  No infectious source on CXR, and he does
   have multiple lines which have been continuously contaminated with
   salivations.  It is especially worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary
   source seems less likely. Lipase was negative, so not likely
   pancreatitis.  Did have a positive blood culture for gram positive rods
   on [**11-15**] that was not able to be speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get peripheral access
   - Differential from yesterday showed eosinophilia, will recheck this
   morning
   - Also, may need to have ART replaced for better monitoring
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and cardiac arrest. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and is now on mechanical ventilation. He has altered mental status following the cardiac arrest, but MRI and EEG results do not show signs of acute ischemia or seizure activity. The patient's physical examination shows inconsistent findings, with some observers noting meaningful purposeful actions and others observing agitation without purposeful movements. He is currently sedated with propofol and fentanyl.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 104/65 mmHg to 161/77 mmHg, heart rate between 66 and 78 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. His fluid balance shows a negative total intake of 740 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient has a history of chronic microvascular white matter ischemic disease with old left frontal encephalomalacia and extensive paranasal sinus and mastoid air cell disease. His urine culture is positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and his blood culture is positive for"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual who experienced a cardiac arrest. The note highlights several medical interventions and observations made in the ICU.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line due to a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with collaterals, necessitating a planned angioplasty prior to removal. The patient also had a dialysis catheter placed and subsequently started.

The patient has a fever of 101.1°F, which was recorded at 4:00 PM on 11/23/2107. The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated. Allergies to vancomycin with a rash have been documented.

Infusions include fentanyl (concentrate) at 150 mcg/hour, KCl (CRRT) at 3 mEq./hour, and other ICU medications such as propofol, midazolam (Versed), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and famotidine (Pepcid).

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted below flowsheet data. Vital signs indicate a maximum temperature of 38.4°C (101.1°F) and a current temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F). Blood pressure ranges from 138/69 mmHg to 166/92 mmHg, heart rate is between 66-90 bpm, respiratory rate is 26"

   Assessment and Plan
   61-year-old man s/p cardiac arrest during HD line placement in IR,
   after admission for ARF in setting of renal transplant.  He has shown
   meaningful neurological recovery, with a reassuring (if limited) MRI.
   Main present issues are fever, respiratory failure, altered mental
   status/encephalopathy, and ARF requiring renal replacement therapy.
   Most likely source of fever is lines.  We removed them yesterday and
   are covering for likely pathogens while awaiting cultures.  Fever has
   generally trended down.  We will continue present ABX for now.

   Dialysis per renal.
   Was agitated today on lightening of sedation
 will d/c midaz, decrease
   fentanyl back toward 50, and use Propofol if needed, then re-assess
   later today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced a cardiac arrest during hemodialysis line placement. He was admitted for acute renal failure in the setting of a renal transplant. The patient has shown meaningful neurological recovery with reassuring MRI findings. However, he is currently facing several issues including fever, respiratory failure, altered mental status/encephalopathy, and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a persistent fever, which may indicate an infection. The most likely source of the fever is the lines, and they have been removed. Coverage for likely pathogens is being provided while awaiting culture results.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation to support his breathing. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and appropriate prophylactic measures are being taken.
3. Altered Mental Status/Encephalopathy: The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. There is a plan to decrease sedation gradually and reassess the patient's mental status.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires renal replacement therapy. Dialysis catheter placement and management are essential to ensure proper fluid and electrolyte balance.
5. Potential complications from renal replacement therapy: This includes issues related to access site infection, bleeding, hypotension, and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis"

   Chief Complaint: Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - Question about ETT placement given bad am CXR --> re-shot. Talked to
   rads, said it's abt 3cm from carina.
   - Restarted Calcitriol
   - D/c Versed and trying to wean down Fentanyl --> down to 100 and was
   having some head bobbing motions, so up to 125 --> 2230pm on 100 Fent
   and 80 Propofol with plans to go down on Fentanyl as tolerated.
   - RSBI/SBT today: did not happen, will get one early tomorrow morning
   - Wake him up and re-examine him: opened eyes spontaneously but does
   not respond to his name or to command. Does not appear to interact with
   external stimuli, only appears to gag and move his head from left to
   right and flex at the hip, and raise his L arm. Pupils approx. 3mm and
   not much reaction to light. Has good gag and corneal reflexes. Didn't
   withdraw limb to nailbed crushing, but could see facial grimacing.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have not shown clear
   seizure activity.  We have not been able to repeat the mental status
   exam from Tuesday morning, presumably because of sedating medications.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl.
   - repeat an exam this afternoon off of propofol
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # Fever: Patient
s fever curve is improving now with lines removed.
   Dialysis line is growing micrococcus.
   - ID consult to ensure that we are adequately covering micrococcus.  As
   this was an infected line/bacteremia, we should cover with 14 days of
   adequate antibiotics.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid pending ID input.
   # Respiratory failure.  Respiratory status is improved, as he is doing
   well on pressure support.  He was originally intubated in setting of
   arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT
   chest and has had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear
   whether he truly has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
   negative to date.
   - Continue with pressure support ventilation.  Will likely not be able
   to think of extubation until patient
s mental status improves.
   - Should do daily RSBI / SBT today
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Restarted back on
   CVVH after getting new lines placed, yesterday many liters negative.
   Don't feel that we need to be as aggressive with fluid removal as he is
   about 14L negative through LOS.
   - there are problems today with his femoral dialysis port.  We will try
   to open with tPA and then consult IR as needed.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and now presents with altered mental status. The patient has been sedated with propofol and fentanyl, and his pupils are pinpoint and not responsive to light. He has labile blood pressures, a fever curve that is improving, and an infected dialysis line. He also has respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an infected dialysis line and a positive culture for Micrococcus. There is a need to ensure adequate coverage with antibiotics.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can occur in critically ill patients.
3. Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressures, with intermittent hypotension that may be due to hypovolemia or an infectious source.
4. Hypertension: The patient experiences hypertension, for which he was given Labetalol. Tight control of blood pressure is important, especially during fluid removal.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient requires pressure support ventilation due to respiratory failure. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (RSBI/SBT) should be performed.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have not shown clear
   seizure activity.  We have not been able to repeat the mental status
   exam from Tuesday morning, presumably because of sedating medications.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl.
   - repeat an exam this afternoon off of propofol
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give
   - Increase Labetalol as necessary
   - Will speak with pharmacy about the potential for interaction between
   Propofol and Linezolid causing increased BP
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so were likely the source, and have been replaced.  His
   lipase was WNL, so pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider
   drug fever if not improved with line removal.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   - Continues on Cefepime and Linezolid
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will do RSBI / SBT today
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  BK virus and CMV negative. He was getting CVVH, then
   the plan was to stop and get IHD, but was restarted back on CVVH
   yesterday after getting new lines placed. Don't feel that we need to be
   as aggressive with fluid removal as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Will continue CVVH through today but can continue to speak with renal
   about when we could start HD
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His mental status has been altered since the PEA arrest. The patient has labile blood pressures, intermittent hypotension, and hypertension. He also has fever, with an unrevealing infectious work-up except for pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood, which could have been a contaminant. His inferior vena cava (IVC) line is infected with pus, and it has been replaced. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, possibly secondary to continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) or intermittent hemodialysis (IHD). His elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) is likely secondary or tertiary due to renal failure. There is swelling in the right upper extremity (RUE), and a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein was found during placement of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with culture positive for pseudomonas, sensitive to cefepime and zosyn. He is being treated with cefepime and linezolid."

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient
s mental status exam
   is increasingly reassuring that he is likely to have some sort of
   meaningful recovery.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion
   artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads have
   not shown clear seizure activity.  His physical exam off sedation is
   inconsistent though, with some seeing meaningful, purposeful actions,
   following commands, and others just seeing agitation and no purposeful
   movements.
   - Continues on Fentanyl gtt. Neuro recommended boluses but did not
   tolerate well so will continue with gtt now but will try to wean down.
   Also continues on Propofol gtt and and Versed boluses
 will d/c Versed
   boluses. Overall the plan will be to go down on the Fentanyl as
   tolerated and try to use the Propofol more.
   - Plan was also to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate
   the ETT tube, but per respiratory that didn't help much
   - Will continue to periodically wean him from sedation and assess
   mental status for continued improvement
   - F/u Neurology recs, they feel he is making improvements, with 75%
   chance recovery with moderate disability
   # Hypertension: Pt was having issues with hypotension due to either
   hypovolemia vs infectious source, but now issue is hypertension and he
   has been started on Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **]. He continues to be
   hypertense this morning with BP's getting up to the 200's.
   - Increase Labetalol as necessary
   - Will speak with pharmacy about the potential for interaction between
   Propofol and Linezolid causing increased BP
   # Fever: patient spiking fevers.  Infectious work-up have overall been
   unrevealing.  He had pseudomonas in his urine and GPR in his blood,
   which could have been a contaminant.  His IJ lines look infected with
   frank pus, so were likely the source, and have been replaced.  His
   lipase was WNL, so pancreatitis d/t Propofol not likely.  Also consider
   drug fever if not improved with line removal.
   - consider stopping unnecessary medication.
   - Continues on Cefepime and Linezolid
   # Respiratory failure.  Intubated in setting of arrest with possible
   hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's
   with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s gathered.
   - Continue assist control ventilation for now, weaning as tolerated.
   - Will do RSBI / SBT today
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far.  BK virus and CMV negative. He was getting CVVH, then
   the plan was to stop and get IHD, but was restarted back on CVVH
   yesterday after getting new lines placed. Don't feel that we need to be
   as aggressive with fluid removal as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Will continue CVVH through today but can continue to speak with renal
   about when we could start HD
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   # Hypotension: This has been less of an issue in the most recent past
   as pt is now hypertense. It is worth leaving on the problem list though
   because he was recently having significant hypotension, etiology likely
   hypovolemic (17 liters negative length of stay, which may be too much)
   vs infectious (new fever to 101.1).  On Cefepime for pseudomonas UTI.
   No infectious source on CXR, and he does have multiple lines which have
   been continuously contaminated with salivations.  It is especially
   worrisome that he is drooling   Urinary source seems less likely.
   Lipase was negative, so not likely pancreatitis.  Did have a positive
   blood culture for gram positive rods on [**11-15**] that was not able to be
   speciated and is likely contamination.
   - Continue cefepime and broaden with linezolid (vancomycin allergy) for
   GPC from possible line infection.
   - Renal attending notes ok with changing HD line to temp femoral line,
   which has been done.
   - Will remove IJ line as well and get PICC
   - Also, may need to have ART replaced for better monitoring
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. EEG monitoring device still in
   place.  There are several days of reads pending.  Neuro has said that
   at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   - Plan is to not treat posturing with benzos, but if concerned for
   prolonged seizure, Tx with 2-4mg IV ativan and let Neuro know.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Post-arrest, the patient has an altered mental status, which is improving but still inconsistent. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 107/61 to 189/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation via an endotracheal tube with assist-control ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels. Electrolyte imbalances are also present. Imaging studies reveal stable cardiomediastinal contour on chest X-ray without large pleural effusion. 

The patient has several medical complications, including renal failure, respiratory failure, hypertension, fever, and altered mental status. He is currently being treated with various medications, including fentanyl,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced a cardiac arrest during hemodialysis line placement in the intensive care unit (ICU).
- He was admitted for acute renal failure in the setting of a renal transplant.
- The patient has shown meaningful neurological recovery with reassuring MRI findings.
- His current main issues include fever, respiratory failure, altered mental status/encephalopathy, and acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy.
- There is a concern for a hemodialysis line infection, as Micrococcus was growing on the line tip.
- The lines have been resited while on adequate therapy, and the patient is being consulted with an infectious disease specialist.
- The patient's fever curve is downtrending, so continuing the present antibiotics is planned.
- The patient is sedated and encephalopathic, with efforts made to reduce benzodiazepine and decrease fentanyl.
- Propofol will be examined later today, and discussion with the neurologist is planned.
- There are concerns about hypertension/hypotension, and using labetalol may be necessary.
- A fluid challenge has been withheld for now, and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is being run.
- The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and requires dialysis per renal.
- Issues related to managing higher bicarbonate levels and discontinuing enteral bicarbonate need to be discussed.
- Other issues are mentioned"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  He was originally intubated in setting of
   arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT
   chest and has had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear
   whether he truly has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
   negative to date.
   - Continue with ventilation.  Will likely not be able to think of
   extubation until patient
s mental status improves.
   - Cannot have CVVH today because of  HD catheter malfunction.  Renal
   notified and feel this is fine for today and they will reassess
   tomorrow.
   - Continue to do daily RSBI / SBT
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads show possible seizure
   activity.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl; he is not tolerating the lowering of
   fentanyl well
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   - start  Keppra when off propofol
   - consider haldol instead of fentanyl in the future
    .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   .
   # Fever: Patient
s fever curve is improving now with lines removed
   (some low grade fevers overnight)  Dialysis line is growing
   micrococcus.
   - ID believes cefepime will suffice for treatment.  As this was an
   infected line/bacteremia, we should cover with 14 days of adequate
   antibiotics.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid pending ID input.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Restarted back on
   CVVH after getting new lines placed, yesterday many liters negative.
   Don't feel that we need to be as aggressive with fluid removal as he is
   about 14L negative through LOS.   Will have to await a new line before
   proceeding with dialysis
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy,
   but may be some seizure activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when
   Propofol off
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He recently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has several medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to possible hypoxia during the arrest. There is a question of pneumonia (PNA) on the chest CT, but the cultures are negative to date. Continuous ventilation is ongoing, and extubation may not be considered until the patient's mental status improves.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered following the PEA arrest. Agitation and continuous gagging are observed when lightening sedation. An MRI did not show signs of acute ischemia, but EEG readings show possible seizure activity. Propofol and small amounts of fentanyl will be used to sedate the patient. Lidocaine oral spray will be tried to help tolerate the endotracheal tube. Neurology recommendations will be followed, and Keppra will be started when off propofol.

3. Labile Blood Pressures: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension possibly due to hypovolemia or an infectious source, as well as intermittent hypertension. Labetalol will be given if hypertensive,"

   Chief Complaint: s/p PEA arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - 4am RSBI 46 on CPAP. Left on CPAP 5/5 for a while with gas afterwards
   7.35/47/170
   - EEG f/u: suspicion low for seizure. When propofol weaned will
   consider Keppra.
   - curb-sided Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9134**] from ID: micrococcus is generally susceptible
   to beta-lactams and cefepime should be adequate treatment.
   - renal recs on bicarb: bicarb will correct with CVVH.  If CVVH has to
   be held b/c of catheter, can give sodium bicarb w/ fluid boluses
   instead of normal saline.  [**Doctor Last Name 699**] spoke to family, she does not
   expect his transplant to have a meaningful return of function.  It had
   been chronically failing with a climbing Cr over several years
   - HD catheter replaced at bedside by IR over line.  Now back on CVVH.
   - Exam off propofol: able to respond with eyes to name and respond to
   commands to squeeze hands and move toes intermittently.  Other times
   just gagging continuously and agitated.  Has copious oral secretions.
   - stopped labetalol for low BPs.
   - 3:30am patient w/ RR 8-10. Becomes more agitated with lower fentanyl.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Respiratory status declined last night as we
   was moved back onto CMV/Assist from pressure support.  He was
   originally intubated in setting of arrest with possible hypoxia
   beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's with
   LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to date.
   - Continue with pressure support ventilation.  Will likely not be able
   to think of extubation until patient
s mental status improves.
   - Continue continuous dialysis to remove any excess fluid
   - Should do daily RSBI / SBT today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads show possible seizure
   activity.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl; he is not tolerating the lowering of
   fentanyl well
   - repeat an exam this afternoon off of propofol
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   - start  Keppra when off propofol
    .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   .
   # Fever: Patient
s fever curve is improving now with lines removed
   (some low grade fevers overnight)  Dialysis line is growing
   micrococcus.
   - ID believes cefepime will suffice for treatment.  As this was an
   infected line/bacteremia, we should cover with 14 days of adequate
   antibiotics.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid pending ID input.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Restarted back on
   CVVH after getting new lines placed, yesterday many liters negative.
   Don't feel that we need to be as aggressive with fluid removal as he is
   about 14L negative through LOS.  Femoral dialysis port was replaced
   last night by IR
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to a possible hypoxic event during cardiac arrest. The patient's respiratory status declined when moved back onto pressure support ventilation, and there are questions about pneumonia on the chest CT and CXRs showing left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. The patient's mental status has been altered since the cardiac arrest, and he is agitated when sedation is lightened. His MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia, but his EEG shows possible seizure activity. 

The patient has labile blood pressures, with intermittent hypotension and hypertension, for which he was given labetalol. The fever curve is improving after removing infected lines, and the dialysis line is growing micrococcus. The ID believes cefepime will be sufficient for treatment. The patient's acute-on-chronic renal failure is unclear, but he will likely not regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis. He has been restarted on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) after getting new lines placed. 

The patient's elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary due to renal failure and not clinically significant at this point. He should restart calcitriol. The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, which is"

","The patient is a 61-year-old man who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and required resuscitation. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on chronic hemodialysis. He also has diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension.

Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He was sedated with propofol and received fentanyl for pain management. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and delirium. He has copious oral secretions, which may require additional interventions.

The patient's blood pressure has been labile, with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. Labetalol was initially used to control blood pressure, but it was stopped due to low blood pressures. The patient's fever curve has improved since removing the infected lines.

Renal function tests indicate acute on chronic renal failure. The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear, but it is unlikely that the patient will regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis. The patient is currently undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with CVVH.

Other issues include a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to cefepime. The patient is still on cefepime to cover this infection. Additionally, there are concerns about seizure"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Respiratory status declined last night as we
   was moved back onto CMV/Assist from pressure support.  He was
   originally intubated in setting of arrest with possible hypoxia
   beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's with
   LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to date.
   - Continue with pressure support ventilation.  Will likely not be able
   to think of extubation until patient
s mental status improves.
   - Cannot have CVVH today because of
   - Should do daily RSBI / SBT today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads show possible seizure
   activity.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl; he is not tolerating the lowering of
   fentanyl well
   - repeat an exam this afternoon off of propofol
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   - start  Keppra when off propofol
    .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   .
   # Fever: Patient
s fever curve is improving now with lines removed
   (some low grade fevers overnight)  Dialysis line is growing
   micrococcus.
   - ID believes cefepime will suffice for treatment.  As this was an
   infected line/bacteremia, we should cover with 14 days of adequate
   antibiotics.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid pending ID input.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Restarted back on
   CVVH after getting new lines placed, yesterday many liters negative.
   Don't feel that we need to be as aggressive with fluid removal as he is
   about 14L negative through LOS.  Femoral dialysis port was replaced
   last night by IR
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in the ICU. The patient has multiple medical conditions, including hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of chronic renal failure treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT). He has been intubated due to respiratory failure, and his mental status is altered post-PEA arrest. The patient's blood pressures are labile, and he has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and hypertension. He also has a fever, which has improved with the removal of infected lines. The patient's renal function is acute on chronic, and he is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). He has an elevated parathyroid hormone level, indicating secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism due to renal failure. The patient also has right upper extremity swelling, likely due to a thrombosed/stenosed brachio-cephalic vein. He has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is sensitive to cefepime. There is also a suspicion of seizure activity or myoclonus, which is being evaluated further. The patient's glucose control is maintained with a sliding scale insulin. His anemia is chronic and stable, possibly"

   Chief Complaint: s/p PEA arrest
   24 Hour Events:
   - 4am RSBI 46 on CPAP. Left on CPAP 5/5 for a while with gas afterwards
   7.35/47/170
   - EEG f/u: suspicion low for seizure. When propofol weaned will
   consider Keppra.
   - curb-sided Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9134**] from ID: micrococcus is generally susceptible
   to beta-lactams and cefepime should be adequate treatment.
   - renal recs on bicarb: bicarb will correct with CVVH.  If CVVH has to
   be held b/c of catheter, can give sodium bicarb w/ fluid boluses
   instead of normal saline.  [**Doctor Last Name 699**] spoke to family, she does not
   expect his transplant to have a meaningful return of function.  It had
   been chronically failing with a climbing Cr over several years
   - HD catheter replaced at bedside by IR over line.  Now back on CVVH.
   - Exam off propofol: able to respond with eyes to name and respond to
   commands to squeeze hands and move toes intermittently.  Other times
   just gagging continuously and agitated.  Has copious oral secretions.
   - stopped labetalol for low BPs.
   - 3:30am patient w/ RR 8-10. Becomes more agitated with lower fentanyl.
   Gas 7.25/66/169 so put on AC w/ RR 18 for time being.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Respiratory status declined last night as we
   was moved back onto CMV/Assist from pressure support.  He was
   originally intubated in setting of arrest with possible hypoxia
   beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's with
   LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to date.
   - Continue with pressure support ventilation.  Will likely not be able
   to think of extubation until patient
s mental status improves.
   - Continue continuous dialysis to remove any excess fluid
   - Should do daily RSBI / SBT today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  It has recently been difficult
   to assess his mental status because he is so agitated when we lighten
   sedation.  His MRI, though severely limited by motion artifact, did not
   show any signs of acute ischemia.  His EEG reads show possible seizure
   activity.
   - We will try to sedate him as much as possible with just propofol and
   small amounts of fentanyl; he is not tolerating the lowering of
   fentanyl well
   - repeat an exam this afternoon off of propofol
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - F/u Neurology recs.
   - start  Keppra when off propofol
    .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   .
   # Fever: Patient
s fever curve is improving now with lines removed
   (some low grade fevers overnight)  Dialysis line is growing
   micrococcus.
   - ID believes cefepime will suffice for treatment.  As this was an
   infected line/bacteremia, we should cover with 14 days of adequate
   antibiotics.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid pending ID input.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Restarted back on
   CVVH after getting new lines placed, yesterday many liters negative.
   Don't feel that we need to be as aggressive with fluid removal as he is
   about 14L negative through LOS.  Femoral dialysis port was replaced
   last night by IR
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Not clinically significant at this point.
   - Restart Calcitriol
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought to be unlikely. When pt had PICC placed yesterday
   found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   .
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 7d course but will continue due
   to persistent fevers.
   .
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy.
   - f/u EEG results
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He recently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been intubated.

The patient's respiratory status has declined, and he is currently on pressure support ventilation. There are concerns about possible pneumonia, but chest X-rays have shown left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate, and bronchoscopy has been unrevealing. The patient is also on continuous dialysis to remove excess fluid.

The patient's mental status is altered post-PEA arrest, and he is agitated when sedation is lightened. An MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia, but EEGs show possible seizure activity. Propofol and fentanyl sedation will be continued, and a repeat neurological examination will be done today.

The patient has labile blood pressures, which may be due to hypovolemia or an infectious source. Labetalol will be given if the patient is hypertensive, and small fluid boluses will be given if hypotensive. If CVVH is not working and the patient has metabolic acidosis, sodium bicarb boluses may be considered.

The patient's fever curve is improving now that lines have been removed. The dialysis line is growing Micrococcus species, and ID believes cefepime will suffice for"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was originally intubated in the setting of arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand. There is ongoing debate regarding pneumonia on CT chest and has had chest X-rays showing left lower lobe atelectasis versus infiltrate. It is unclear whether he truly has pneumonia or not. A bronchoscopic evaluation was unrevealing, and cultures have been negative to date.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, making it difficult to assess his level of consciousness. He is agitated when sedation is lightened, which limits the ability to perform spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). There are plans to continue daily trials of stopping sedation and measuring respiratory system compliance (RSBI) / SBT.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's acute renal failure (ARF) is superimposed on his pre-existing ESRD. The etiology of ARF is unclear, but it is unlikely that he will regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis. He has been restarted on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) after getting new lines placed. However, there have been problems"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
   Active issues at this point:
   # Respiratory failure.  He was originally intubated in setting of
   arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT
   chest and has had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear
   whether he truly has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
   negative to date.
   - Continues mechanically ventilated due to mental status and it is
   unclear if his mental status will improve given that his off sedation
   exams have been less purposeful recently, after initial signs of
   progress and following commands.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
   - Will have to start thinking about trach/PEG if family wants to
   continue support.
   - Will need to have repeat family meeting about goals of care, but will
   have to touch base with Neurology about his chances of recovery first,
   given most recent exams
   - Daily off sedation exams, RSBI
s, SBT
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  His MRI, though severely
   limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute ischemia.
   Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   - Had been trying to wean the Fentanyl and sedate more with Propofol,
   but has not tolerated this very well and still on substantial amts of
   Fentanyl
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - Start  Keppra when off propofol
   - consider haldol instead of fentanyl in the future
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful.
   - No need for urgent HD/CVVH per renal
   - Will need to go to IR on Monday for replacement of his line, then
   restart CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # Fever: Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long course
   of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days. These
   were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown out
   Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the other
   day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 10 of
   Cefepime and day 6 of Linezolid
   - Would clarify the exact time course for these two ABx
 14d from when
   Micrococcus was isolated?
   # HypoNa: Possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS. Will give small 250cc bolus today and f/u electrolytes later
   today.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   Other stable issues:
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy,
   but may be some seizure activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when
   Propofol off
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: L art line, R PICC placed [**11-23**], and R fem HD line with VIP

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. The patient was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. 

The active issues at this point include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is mechanically ventilated due to mental status and it is unclear if his mental status will improve. He also has copious secretions, which is concerning for aspiration if he were to be weaned from the ventilator.
2. Altered mental status post-PEA arrest: The patient's MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia, but he has been agitated upon weaning of sedation. Sedation has been restarted with Propofol.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The etiology of ARF is unclear, but the patient's renal function is unlikely to improve enough to be free of dialysis. The patient's CVVH has not been functioning well, and the HD line needs to be replaced.
4. Labile blood pressures: The patient has intermittent hypotension due to either hypovolemia or an infectious source, and hypertension for which he was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG. Tighter control of blood pressure is needed.
5. Fever: The patient has low"

   61 y/o man s/p asystolic/PEA arrest while in I.R. to get HD line.  S/P
   cooling.  Other issues include ARF in renal transplant (etiology not
   clear
 predated arrest) and fever.  Has had really remarkable
   improvements in neurologic exam and has good chance for significant
   recovery, but has been more delirious for the past couple of days.
   active issues:
          post-arrest (post-cooling)
          ARF in renal transplant
          resp failure
          mental status- now on propofol30/fent50. (A few days ago pt
   was able to follow commands, track, laugh at a joke)
          oral secretions
          micrococcus line infection
   Plan:
   Mental status/delirium/sedation: try adding Haldol 2-5mg IV to observe
   if possible to decrease propofol.
   At this point mental status is limiting barrier to extubation.
   Will need discussion with neuro and then family to readdress mental
   status and goals of care. It is day 12 intubation, will need trach/PEG
   if he is unable to liberate from vent, which seems unlikely given his
   lack of improvement in mental status.
   ID: linezolid/cefipime for micrococcus line infection
   Hyponatremia- may be hypovolemic. Trial small bolus NS.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man who experienced an asystolic/PEA arrest while in the intensive care unit (ICU) to get a hemodialysis line. The patient has a history of renal transplant and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a recent cardiac arrest. The patient's neurologic exam has shown significant improvement, but he has been more delirious for the past few days.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm with a range of 87-108 bpm, blood pressure of 82/74 mmHg with previous readings ranging from 78/47 mmHg to 138/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glucose, and troponin T levels. The sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium levels are within normal ranges. The urine output has"

 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
   Active issues at this point:
   # Respiratory failure.  Back on pressure support this morning and
   tolerating well.  Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.
   - Continues mechanically ventilated due to mental status and it is
   unclear if his mental status will improve given that his off sedation
   exams have been less purposeful recently, after initial signs of
   progress and following commands.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
   - Need to discuss trach/peg with family.
   - Daily off sedation exams, RSBI
s, SBT
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of 700.
   - Have had to change to fentanyl/versed because of very high
   triglycerides
   - Start  Keppra if having EEG
   - f/u neurology recs.
   - consider haldol instead of fentanyl in the future
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Needs to have femoral HD line
   replaced today.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF unclear thus
   far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will regain enough
   renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back on CVVH after
   getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not been
   functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 11 of
   Cefepime and day 7 of Linezolid
   - Would clarify the exact time course for these two ABx
 14d from when
   Micrococcus was isolated?
   # HypoNa: Today level is because of lipemia.  Possibly volume deplete
   as he is about 14L negative through LOS. Will give small 250cc bolus
   today and f/u electrolytes later today.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   Other stable issues:
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy,
   but may be some seizure activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when
   Propofol off
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: L art line, R PICC placed [**11-23**], and R fem HD line with VIP

 will need to have R fem HD line replaced
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and is now vent-dependent due to mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to be mechanically ventilated due to mental status and copious secretions, which increases the risk of aspiration.
2. Altered mental status: The patient has intact brainstem reflexes but has difficulty assessing his cortex. Weaning of sedation has shown agitation, and there is a concern for potential seizure activity.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient needs to have his femoral hemodialysis (HD) line replaced today, and CVVH is not functioning well. He may require stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
4. Labile blood pressures: The patient has intermittent hypotension due to hypovolemia or an infectious source, as well as hypertension. Close monitoring and management are necessary.
5. Fever: The patient continues to have low-grade temperatures despite being on long courses of antibiotics (Cefepime and Linezolid). The source of infection needs further investigation.
6. HypoNa: The patient's sodium levels are low due to lipemia. Small fluid boluses will be given to address this issue.
7. Elevated PTH: The patient's parathyroid hormone level is elevated likely secondary or tertiary due to renal failure. Renal follow-up is recommended.
8. RUE swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, which may be related to a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein. Plasty is required prior to PICC removal.
9. UTI: The patient has a culture-positive urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas, sensitive to Zosyn and Cefepime. Continuing Cefepime is recommended.
10. Seizure activity vs. myoclonus: An EEG was done to differentiate between seizures and myoclonus. Keppra may be started when Propofol is off.
11. DM type II: The patient's blood sugar levels are well-controlled with a sliding scale only.
12. Anemia: The patient has chronic and stable anemia, possibly related to renal disease or ACD.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient is now dependent on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to be mechanically ventilated due to mental status changes and the risk of aspiration. There is a need for further evaluation and potential tracheostomy if the patient's mental status does not improve.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has not improved despite weaning off sedation, indicating a potential ongoing neurological issue. Further assessment by neurology is recommended to determine the chances of recovery.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is severely compromised, and the etiology of acute renal failure is unclear. It is unlikely that he will regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.
4. Fever: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to have low-grade fevers. The source of infection is still unclear, and additional testing is required to identify the cause.
5. Hypotension and Hypertension: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension and hypertension, which may be due to hypovolemia or an infectious source. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluid and medication therapy are necessary.
6. Catheter-Related Infection: The patient had a catheter tip culture positive for Micrococcus, but it is being treated with Cefepime.
7. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a negative fluid balance and may have hypoNa. Small fluid boluses and electrolyte monitoring are recommended.
8. Hypercalcemia and Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has elevated PTH levels secondary to renal failure. Renal consultation is needed for further management.
9. RUE Swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity, possibly due to a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein. Vascular intervention may be required.
10. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas, which is sensitive to Cefepime. Continuing the antibiotic therapy is necessary.
11. Seizure Activity vs. Myoclonus: The patient may be experiencing seizure activity or myoclonus. An EEG was performed, and the neurology team is evaluating the results.

These potential medical complications require close monitoring and appropriate management to optimize the patient's health outcomes."

   Assessment and Plan
 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
   Active issues at this point:
   # Respiratory failure.  Back on pressure support this morning.
   He was originally intubated in setting of arrest with possible hypoxia
   beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has had CXR's with
   LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly has PNA or
   not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to date.
   - Continues mechanically ventilated due to mental status and it is
   unclear if his mental status will improve given that his off sedation
   exams have been less purposeful recently, after initial signs of
   progress and following commands.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
   - Will have to start thinking about trach/PEG if family wants to
   continue support.
   - Will need to have repeat family meeting about goals of care, but will
   have to touch base with Neurology about his chances of recovery first,
   given most recent exams
   - Daily off sedation exams, RSBI
s, SBT
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
    Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of 700.
   - Had been trying to wean the Fentanyl and sedate more with Propofol,
   but has not tolerated this very well and still on substantial amts of
   Fentanyl
   - Continue to try Lidocaine oral spray to see if he can tolerate the
   ETT tube
   - Start  Keppra when off propofol
   - consider haldol instead of fentanyl in the future
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF
   unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful.
   - No need for urgent HD/CVVH per renal
   - Will need to go to IR on Monday for replacement of his line, then
   restart CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.
   Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long course of
   Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days. These were
   initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown out
   Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the other
   day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 11 of
   Cefepime and day 7 of Linezolid
   - Would clarify the exact time course for these two ABx
 14d from when
   Micrococcus was isolated?
   # HypoNa: Possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through
   LOS. Will give small 250cc bolus today and f/u electrolytes later
   today.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   Other stable issues:
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy,
   but may be some seizure activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when
   Propofol off
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - BS
s in 100
s, will continue to cover with SSI only
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease
   - continue to monitor.
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: L art line, R PICC placed [**11-23**], and R fem HD line with VIP
   port placed [**11-23**]
 will need to have R fem HD line replaced
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. 

The patient is currently mechanically ventilated due to mental status and the uncertainty of his ability to wean off sedation. There are concerns about potential pneumonia (PNA) and the need for a tracheostomy/peg tube if the family decides to continue life support. 

The patient's altered mental status is attributed to the PEA arrest, and his brain MRI did not show signs of acute ischemia. Weaning of sedation has shown agitation, and he has been switched from propofol to versed due to hypertriglyceridemia.

The patient is experiencing labile blood pressures, intermittent hypotension, and hypertension. The cause of hypotension is unclear, with possibilities including hypovolemia or an infectious source. Hypertension is being managed with labetalol.

There are ongoing issues with fever, and the patient is still on cefepime and linezolid. These medications were initially prescribed to treat a urinary tract infection (UTI) with Pseudomonas, but the recent growth of Micrococcus from catheter tips suggests a possible catheter-related bloodstream infection. The ID physician has confirmed that cef"

   Assessment and Plan
 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Has been on AC for most of MICU course, but yesterday tried on
   pressure support and tolerating well.
   - At this point, most importantly need to speak with family and discuss
   trach/PEG and moving towards rehab as he doesn
t appear to be making
   great strides in terms of his mental status or his respiratory status.
   - His agitation could be in part due to the ETT and it
s reasonable to
   to think getting it out could be beneficial
 Trach talk with family
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700.
   - Neuro has been following and they have put him back on continuous EEG
   due to a staring spell that they witnessed yesterday
   - Start  Keppra if having EEG changes
   - Will give a trial of Haldol today to see if any improvement.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful. Needs to have femoral HD line replaced today.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide per renal recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 12 of
   Cefepime and day 8 of Linezolid
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen but unclear if this will only be with HD/CVVH
   - continue to monitor.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # HypoNa: Normal today but recently low. Thought to be lipemic samples
   vs  possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through LOS.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers as above
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  His first round of continuous EEG
   monitoring did not show outright seizure activity but
epileptiform
   activity
 according to Neuro. He was not ever started on AED
s and they
   said that it is likely encephalopathy, but may be some seizure
   activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when Propofol off.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and altered mental status. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and experienced a post-cardiac arrest (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Active issues at this point include respiratory failure, altered mental status, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been intubated due to possible hypoxia and potential pneumonia (PNA), which is still unclear. He has been on acetaminophen and cefepime for most of his MICU course. Recently, he was tried on pressure support and tolerated it well.

The patient's altered mental status post-PEA arrest is a concern. He has intact brainstem reflexes but shows signs of agitation and lack of progress. An MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia, but continuous EEG monitoring was restarted due to a staring spell witnessed yesterday. The neuro team plans to start keppra if there are EEG changes and will give a trial of Haldol today to see if there is any improvement.

In terms of renal failure, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to his ESRD. The etiology of ARF is unclear, but it is unlikely that he will regain enough renal function to be"

   Assessment and Plan
 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure.  Back on pressure support this morning and
   tolerating well.  Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.
   - Continues mechanically ventilated due to mental status and it is
   unclear if his mental status will improve given that his off sedation
   exams have been less purposeful recently, after initial signs of
   progress and following commands.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
   - Need to discuss trach/peg with family.
   - Daily off sedation exams, RSBI
s, SBT
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of 700.
   - Neuro will put back on continuous EEG to evaluate for any seizure
   activity
   - Need to touch base with Neuro regarding overall prognosis and what
   the trajectory of his mental status is
   - Have had to change to fentanyl/versed because of very high
   triglycerides
   - Start  Keppra if having EEG changes
   - consider haldol instead of fentanyl in the future
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  Needs to have femoral HD line
   replaced today.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of ARF unclear thus
   far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will regain enough
   renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back on CVVH after
   getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not been
   functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide per renal recs
   - Renal is following
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen but unclear if this will only be with HD/CVVH
   - continue to monitor.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 12 of
   Cefepime and day 8 of Linezolid
   - Would clarify the exact time course for these two ABx -->  14d from
   when Micrococcus was isolated?
   # HypoNa: Today level is because of lipemia.  Possibly volume deplete
   as he is about 14L negative through LOS. Not hypoNa today
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   Other stable issues:
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus. Another 20 minute EEG was done this
   morning  Neuro has said that at this point it is likely encephalopathy,
   but may be some seizure activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when
   Propofol off
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiac arrest. The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes.

Active issues at this point include respiratory failure, altered mental status, renal failure, and possible seizure activity. The patient has been experiencing copious secretions, which is concerning for aspiration if he were to be weaned from the ventilator. The altered mental status may be a result of the recent cardiac arrest, and it is unclear if his mental status will improve given that his off sedation exams have been less purposeful recently.

The patient also has labile blood pressures, intermittent hypotension, and hypertension. There is a possibility of an infectious source causing the hypotension. The patient is currently on a long course of antibiotics including cefepime and linezolid. The fever could be due to an ongoing infection, and the patient has recently grown Micrococcus from catheter tips, which is being treated with cefepime.

Other stable issues include chronic anemia, hypoNa, and elevated PTH levels secondary to renal failure. The patient has RUE swelling, possibly related to a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) with culture positive for Pseudomonas.

   Will start 5mg haldol tid PO to control agitation.
   Renal failure:  HD after replacement of dialysis line.
   Will discuss with family today to see if we can get tracheostomy
   tomorrow.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of failed renal transplant and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD). He experienced a cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. The patient has allergies to vancomycin and has received cefipime and linezolid as antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/45 mmHg to 137/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including fentanyl, midazolam, famotidine, heparin sodium, prednisone, insulin, cell cept, albuterol, epo, and others. 

Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,524 mL and a total output of 1,442 mL. 

The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The ABG results indicate a pH of 7.27, PaCO2 of 55 mmHg, HCO3- of 22 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Physical examination reveals generalized edema in both lower extremities and unresponsiveness with no assessment of movement or tone. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), potassium, and glucose. The white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while hemoglobin and platelet levels are within normal ranges. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, electrolytes, and cardiac markers are also provided. 

The patient has a history of diarrhea, altered mental status (not delirium), renal failure (ESRD), acute respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. 

The plan includes starting haloperidol to control agitation, replacing the dialysis line, discussing tracheostomy with the family, and continuing ICU care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further deterioration of renal function."

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Has been on AC for most of MICU course, but yesterday tried on
   pressure support and tolerating well.
   - At this point, most importantly need to speak with family and discuss
   trach/PEG and moving towards rehab as he doesn
t appear to be making
   great strides in terms of his mental status or his respiratory status.
   - His agitation could be in part due to the ETT and it
s reasonable to
   to think getting it out could be beneficial
 Trach talk with family
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700.
   - Neuro has been following and they have put him back on continuous EEG
   due to a staring spell that they witnessed yesterday
   - Start  Keppra if having EEG changes
   - Will give a trial of Haldol today to see if any improvement.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful. Needs to have femoral HD line replaced today.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide per renal recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 12 of
   Cefepime and day 8 of Linezolid
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
    - Will start Epogen but unclear if this will only be with HD/CVVH
   - continue to monitor.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # HypoNa: Normal today but recently low. Thought to be lipemic samples
   vs  possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through LOS.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers as above
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  His first round of continuous EEG
   monitoring did not show outright seizure activity but
epileptiform
   activity
 according to Neuro. He was not ever started on AED
s and they
   said that it is likely encephalopathy, but may be some seizure
   activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when Propofol off.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest (PEA). The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. Active issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, fever, and labile blood pressures. Other less active/stable issues include anemia, hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, and right upper extremity swelling. The patient has been on a prolonged course of antibiotics and has grown Micrococcus from central line tips, but ID has stated that cefepime will suffice for this organism. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, as he is ventilator-dependent and has had episodes of LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate. The need for tracheostomy and weaning from the ventilator should be discussed with the family.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has not improved despite previous efforts to wean sedation. Continuous EEG monitoring has been restarted due to a staring spell witnessed by neurology. Additional trials of antipsychotic medications may be considered.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is likely to remain impaired, and he may require ongoing dialysis. The placement of a"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.
   - Need to talk to family about trach PEG today.
   - His agitation could be in part due to the ETT and it
s reasonable to
   to think getting it out could be beneficial
 Trach talk with family
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700.
   - Neuro has been following and they have put him back on continuous EEG
   due to a staring spell that they witnessed yesterday
   - Start  Keppra if having EEG changes
   - Will give a trial of Haldol today to see if any improvement.
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful. Needs to have femoral HD line replaced today.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide per renal recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 12 of
   Cefepime and day 8 of Linezolid
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
    - Will start Epogen but unclear if this will only be with HD/CVVH
   - continue to monitor.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # HypoNa: Normal today but recently low. Thought to be lipemic samples
   vs  possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through LOS.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers as above
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  His first round of continuous EEG
   monitoring did not show outright seizure activity but
epileptiform
   activity
 according to Neuro. He was not ever started on AED
s and they
   said that it is likely encephalopathy, but may be some seizure
   activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when Propofol off.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea, acute renal failure (ARF), and cardiac arrest. Currently, he is ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient's active issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, and fever. The respiratory failure is likely due to possible hypoxia during cardiac arrest and subsequent ventilator dependence. The altered mental status may be a result of the PEA arrest, and further evaluation with continuous EEG monitoring is ongoing.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely secondary to the ESRD, and the etiology of ARF is unclear. CVVH has been initiated, but it is not functioning well. The patient needs to have a femoral HD line replaced today for better dialysis.

The fever is low-grade and may be due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by Pseudomonas, which has been treated with cefepime. However, recently Micrococcus has grown from the catheter tips of the central venous line (CVL), but ID has stated that cefepime will suffice for this infection.

Other less active/stable issues include anemia, labile blood pressures, hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, right upper extremity swelling, and possible seizure activity.

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now

    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with

   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.
   - Need to talk to family about trach PEG today.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will continue today with schedule Haldol to see if any improvement in
   his mental status
 5mg PO tid
   - If no response to Haldol, consider Seroquel
   - Get baseline EKG for Haldol
   - Continue Fent/Versed for sedation for now
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will

   - He is scheduled to go to IR today for placement of a subclavian HD
   line
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. Today is day 14 of the Cefepime and day 9 of Linezolid.
   - We will stop ABx at this point, as he has gotten a long course of
   Cefepime and Linezolid.
   - Watch fever curve
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen with HD
   - His Hct is acutely down this am, will consider transfusing him
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and if he
   is hypertense through the day we will restart the Labetalol either prn
   or scheduled, as necessary. If hypotension returns, would give small
   boluses of fluid
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Normal today but recently low. Thought to be lipemic samples
   vs  possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through LOS.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  His first round of continuous EEG
   monitoring did not show outright seizure activity but
epileptiform
   activity
 according to Neuro. He was not ever started on AED
s and they
   said that it is likely encephalopathy, but may be some seizure
   activity.  Recommended starting Keppra when Propofol off.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and is now dependent on the ventilator due to mental status changes. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, fever, anemia, labile blood pressures, hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, RUE swelling, and possible seizure activity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on the ventilator due to mental status changes and agitation. There is a concern for pneumonia, and the possibility of tracheostomy placement is being considered.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has not improved despite weaning off sedation. There is a concern for continued seizures, and he has been started on Kendra (levetiracetam) for seizure prophylaxis.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is unstable, and he requires ongoing dialysis. There is a need for a reliable vascular access, and a subclavian HD line placement has been scheduled.
4. Fever: The patient has had a long course of antibiotics for a positive urine culture with Pseudomonas. Now that the culture results are back, the antibiotics may be stopped, and the fever curve will be monitored.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.
   - Need to talk to family about trach PEG today.
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro -
   - Will continue today with schedule Haldol to see if any improvement in
   his mental status.
   - Continue Fent/Versed for sedation for now
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and have been
   unsuccessful. Needs to have femoral HD line replaced today.
   - Will need to go to IR today for replacement of his line, then restart
   CVVH afterwards.
   - continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - stop calcitriol and increase aluminum hydroxide per renal recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: continued low-grade temps.  Will continue cefepime and
   linezolid.  Pt still with some low grade fevers, has been on long
   course of Cefepime and most recently Linezolid added for past 6 days.
   These were initially treating UTI with Pseudomonas. Now, he has grown
   out Micrococcus from
 catheter tips from CVL
s that were pulled the
   other day. ID has said that Cefipime will suffice for this Micrococcus.
   - Continue Cefepime and Linezolid for 14d course. Today is day 12 of
   Cefepime and day 8 of Linezolid
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
    - Will start Epogen but unclear if this will only be with HD/CVVH
   - continue to monitor.
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt having intermittent hypotension due to
   either hypovolemia vs infectious source, and hypertension for which he
   was getting Labetalol 400mg PO/NG [**Hospital1 **].  Next time he is hypertensive we
   will try a labetalol drip to have tighter control with a short-acting
   medication that can be stopped when we are trying to remove fluid.  In
   the meantime, if he is hypotensive we should give small fluid boluses
   while running CVVH even.
   - Labetolol gtt if hypertensive
   - If hypotensive, give small fluid boluses.  If CVVH is not working and
   patient still has metabolic acidosis, consider boluses with sodium
   bicarb.
   # HypoNa: Normal today but recently low. Thought to be lipemic samples
   vs  possibly volume deplete as he is about 14L negative through LOS.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   - F/u with renal about electrolytes
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile
   #  UTI. Borderline UA. Culture positive for Pseudomonas of 2
   morphologies.  Sensitive to Zosyn and cefepime.
   - Continue Cefepime.  Has now completed 10d course but will continue
   due to persistent fevers as above
   # ?Seizure activity vs. myoclonus.  His first round of continuous EEG
   monitoring did not show outright seizure activity but

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. He was admitted with acute respiratory failure and acute kidney injury (AKI). He subsequently developed septic shock and cardiac arrest, requiring mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current dependence on mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure. Agitation and thrashing around when sedation is weaned suggest a possible underlying cause such as an infectious process or seizures. Tracheostomy placement may be necessary for long-term airway management.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits agitation, lack of responsiveness, and difficulty tracking, which may be due to encephalopathy or seizure activity. Continuous EEG monitoring has shown epileptiform activity, prompting the initiation of antiepileptic medication (Keppra). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and guide appropriate treatment.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has a history of ESRD and is currently experiencing acute renal failure. The etiology of AKI is unclear, and the patient's renal function is expected to remain compromised. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) may be required for ongoing renal support, and medication adjustments might be necessary due to altered drug clearance.
4. Fever: The patient continues to"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, who suffered from a cardiac arrest and is currently in respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving sedation for agitation and has been started on Keppra for seizures. He is also on Haldol to control agitation and reduce medication drips. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 145/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 6.5, 7.9, and 8.3 mg/dL, as well as elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 126 mg/dL to 188 mg/dL. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is within normal range, but the platelet count is not provided. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium (K+) and phosphorus (PO4), while calcium (Ca++) and magnesium (Mg++) levels are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, right lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity edema. Neurologically, the patient is attentive but does not follow commands and responds only to"

   - Have spoken to IP --> they can do on Friday, need to talk with family
   about moving forward. They will get back to us.
   - Stopped Cefepime and Linezolid
   - Renal recs: calcium will improve with CVVH, to be restarted
   - IR for HD line placement --> DONE! Now has L subclavian HD line and
   CVVH has been restarted.
   - Start Haldol 5 tid
   - Asked attending to call wife
   - In evening called to assess HTN to 180's. Around 4pm, pt went to IR,
   got Propofol to sedate him, and bp's were 130-150. Came back up, off
   Propofol back to Fent 100/Versed 8. BP's to 180's, resistant to
   Labetalol prn's. Face looks agitated/angry and biting down on ETT.
   Given Seroquel 50mg once.
   - Then, RT switched AC to CPAP bc he was fighting vent. Pt began having
   episode that neuro witnessed other day: staring straight up, not
   blinking. Face tense appearing. Witnessed fasciculations in bilateral
   temporal areas, concerning for electrical discharge in facial nerve??
   Not rigid in rest of body. BP's 170's. --> Will give time for Seroquel
   to work, then consider going up on the Versed, especially if seizure
   activity.
   - HTN, so scheduled Labetalol. Increased Versed gtt.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.
   - First priority for today will be to coordinate IP and family for
   trach/PEG tomorrow when IP is available
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will slowly uptitrate his Versed gtt. Continue on Fentanyl as is.
   - Will continue today with schedule Haldol to see if any improvement in
   his mental status 5mg PO tid
   - Seroquel was also tried last night, but unsure if either the Haldol
   or the Seroquel, or increasing the Versed, has made much difference
   - F/u EKG for Haldol/Seroquel
   - Get baseline EKG for Haldol
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH per renal recommendations.
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Continue off ABx for now, watch fever curve.
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen with HD
   - Had considered transfusing yesterday, will give him 1U PRBC's today
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and has
   started on scheduled Labetalol.
   - Keep watching pressures, and go up on Labetalol as necessary.
   - If hypoTN returns, stop Labetalol and consider small boluses in
   context of getting CVVH.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure. He had a cardiac arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, fever, anemia, labile blood pressures, hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, RUE swelling, and diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status can increase the risk of aspiration, seizures, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of chronic renal failure may result in further deterioration of renal function, electrolyte imbalances, and fluid overload.
4. Fever: The presence of fever could indicate an ongoing infection, which may lead to sepsis or septic shock if not promptly identified and treated.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may contribute to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
6. Labile Blood Pressures: The patient's labile blood pressures can increase the risk of end-organ damage and complications associated with hypertension.
7. HypoNa: The patient"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now vent dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.
   - First priority for today will be to coordinate IP and family for
   trach/PEG tomorrow when IP is available
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will slowly uptitrate his Versed gtt. Continue on Fentanyl as is.
   - Will continue today with schedule Haldol to see if any improvement in
   his mental status 5mg PO tid
   - Seroquel was also tried last night, but unsure if either the Haldol
   or the Seroquel, or increasing the Versed, has made much difference
   - F/u EKG for Haldol/Seroquel
   - Get baseline EKG for Haldol
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH per renal recommendations.
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Continue off ABx for now, watch fever curve.
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen with HD
   - Had considered transfusing yesterday, will give him 1U PRBC's today
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and has
   started on scheduled Labetalol.
   - Keep watching pressures, and go up on Labetalol as necessary.
   - If hypoTN returns, stop Labetalol and consider small boluses in
   context of getting CVVH.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation and is now dependent on the ventilator due to altered mental status.

The patient's current issues include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated during cardiac arrest and may have had hypoxia prior to that. There is a question of pneumonia on chest CT, but the patient's bronchoscopy and cultures have been negative so far. The main hindrance to weaning from the ventilator is his agitation, thrashing around, and lack of responsiveness. There is concern for aspiration due to excessive secretions.

2. Altered mental status: The patient had a post-cardiac arrest altered mental status. His MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia. Weaning of sedation leads to agitation and thrashing. He was on Propofol but switched to Versed due to triglyceride levels of 700. Neurology has noted a staring spell that could be concerning for seizures, so continuous EEG was performed, showing epileptiform spikes but no seizure activity. Keppra was started, and the dose needs to be clarified with Neurology. Haldol and Seroquel were tried but with limited success.

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.
   - First priority for today will be to coordinate IP and family for
   trach/PEG tomorrow when IP is available; need consent for procedures
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will slowly uptitrate his Versed gtt. Continue on Fentanyl as is.
   - Increase haldol to 10mg tid
   - F/u EKG done today because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH per renal recommendations.
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Continue off ABx for now, watch fever curve.
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen with HD
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC's today
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and has
   started on scheduled Labetalol.
   - Keep watching pressures, and go up on Labetalol as necessary.
   - If hypoTN returns, stop Labetalol and consider small boluses in
   context of getting CVVH.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a cardiac arrest. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent and has been experiencing agitation and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to the inability to wean off the ventilator. The main hindrance is his agitation and thrashing around, which can lead to potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be a result of the cardiac arrest or an underlying neurological condition. It is crucial to monitor for seizures and continue EEG monitoring. The patient is currently on antiepileptic medication (Keppra) and sedatives (Versed and Haldol) to manage his agitation and potential seizure activity.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is superimposed on chronic renal failure. This could be due to several factors, including hypotension, infection, or medication toxicity. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) has been restarted, but there have been issues with its functioning. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte imbalances is essential.
4. Fever: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient continues to"

   - Stopped Cefepime and Linezolid
   - Renal recs: calcium will improve with CVVH, to be restarted
   - IR for HD line placement --> DONE! Now has L subclavian HD line and
   CVVH has been restarted.
   - Start Haldol 5 tid
   - Asked attending to call wife
   - In evening called to assess HTN to 180's. Around 4pm, pt went to IR,
   got Propofol to sedate him, and bp's were 130-150. Came back up, off
   Propofol back to Fent 100/Versed 8. BP's to 180's, resistant to
   Labetalol prn's. Face looks agitated/angry and biting down on ETT.
   Given Seroquel 50mg once.
   - Then, RT switched AC to CPAP bc he was fighting vent. Pt began having
   episode that neuro witnessed other day: staring straight up, not
   blinking. Face tense appearing. Witnessed fasciculations in bilateral
   temporal areas, concerning for electrical discharge in facial nerve??
   Not rigid in rest of body. BP's 170's. --> Will give time for Seroquel
   to work, then consider going up on the Versed, especially if seizure
   activity.

   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will slowly uptitrate his Versed gtt. Continue on Fentanyl as is.
   - Increase haldol to 10mg tid
   - F/u EKG done today because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH per renal recommendations.
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Continue off ABx for now, watch fever curve.
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Will start Epogen with HD
   - Transfuse 1U PRBC's today
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and has
   started on scheduled Labetalol.
   - Keep watching pressures, and go up on Labetalol as necessary.
   - If hypoTN returns, stop Labetalol and consider small boluses in
   context of getting CVVH.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who presented with dyspnea, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and possible hypoxia. The patient was intubated during cardiac arrest and has been ventilator-dependent ever since. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, hypertension, altered mental status, renal failure, and cardiac arrest.

Respiratory failure: The patient's main hindrance to weaning from the ventilator is his agitation, which could be due to the endotracheal tube (ETT). There is also concern for aspiration due to copious secretions. It is recommended to coordinate with the patient's family for a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tomorrow when the patient is available.

Altered mental status: The patient has intact brainstem reflexes but has difficulty assessing his cortex. The MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia. Weaning of sedation consistently shows agitation, and there have been recent episodes of thrashing around, not following commands, and not making progress. Propofol was changed to versed due to triglyceride levels of 700. The neurologist noted a staring spell that was concerning for continued seizures, so continuous EEG was performed, showing epileptiform spikes but no outright seizure activity.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who experienced cardiac arrest and respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU and requires increased sedation due to agitation overnight. The patient has a history of hypertension, diarrhea, altered mental status, renal failure, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest. He is on multiple medications including calcium gluconate, fentanyl, midazolam, KCl, and others. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, but he has right and left lower extremity edema. His laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and glucose, while other values are within normal range. The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and SpO2 of 100%. The patient's cardiovascular system shows normal heart sounds, and peripheral pulses are not assessed. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive and does not follow simple commands. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Seizures: The patient may be having seizure activity, and the dose of keppra is being uptitrated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's agitation is a major limitation on weaning from mechanical ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
   .
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and trach placement should help with this.
   - IP for trach and PEG--> need to call to assure is on schedule; if not
   will ask surgery to do procedures
   - He is also having copious secretions which is concerning for
   aspiration if he were to be weaned from the vent
   - He is very agitated and difficult to be weaned from the vent
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Will slowly uptitrate his Versed gtt. Continue on Fentanyl as is.
   - Haldol to 10mg tid
   - Seroquel can be added because QTc was normal
   - F/u EKG done today because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Continue CVVH per renal recommendations.
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   .
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Chest xray this morning
   - re pan culture this morning
   - add abios if he has CXR
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - On  Epogen with HD
   - Transfused 1U PRBC's
   - Will continue to monitor
   .
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, and has
   started on scheduled Labetalol.
   - Continue on PRN IV labetalol because pressures are labile and cannot
   prescribe standing dose.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure.
- He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest.
- The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status and has been sedated.
- He has been experiencing respiratory failure, with difficulty weaning from the ventilator due to agitation and risk of aspiration.
- The patient's altered mental status post-PEA arrest has shown some improvement but with recent regression, including a staring spell that was concerning for seizures.
- He has been on continuous EEG monitoring, and epileptiform spikes have been observed without outright seizure activity.
- The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is ongoing, with unclear etiology of ARF. He is unlikely to regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.
- He has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has had issues with the functioning of his renal access lines.
- The patient has had a long course of antibiotics for a positive urine culture with Pseudomonas and recently developed purulent appearing central venous lines (CVLs) that were removed and grew Micrococcus.
- He has been receiving a combination of Cefepime and Linezolid for his infections.

Active issues at this point include respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, fever, anemia, labile blood pressures, hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, right upper extremity swelling, and diabetes mellitus type II. 

The patient has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics for a positive urine culture, antiepileptic drugs due to suspected seizures, and renal replacement therapy. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate several abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high creatinine, elevated potassium, and abnormal liver function tests. 

Imaging studies have shown bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing CVVH, tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, weaning off sedation, titrating midazolam, increasing haloperidol, and monitoring for seizures. 

Other less active/stable issues include hypoNa, endocrine abnormalities, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with respiratory failure following a cardiac arrest. He remains agitated and requires heavy sedation. The patient has a history of hypertension, anemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). He is currently experiencing diarrhea and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 145/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine levels, and altered electrolyte levels. His glucose levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, anemia, and ESRD. He is being treated with various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is the main barrier due to poor muscle strength. There is a concern for increased secretions, and a new chest X-ray may be necessary to assess any changes.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is on reduced doses of sedatives and has been given haloperidol to manage agitation. Monitoring for any changes in mental status is important to prevent further complications.

3. Renal Failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG
   yesterday
   - Low grade fevers, secretions on L, L lobe collapse, gm (+) cocci and
   GNR--> start VAP treatment with cefipime, linezolid, and cipro
   - weaning sedation in now that using PO haldol and seroquel.  Has been
   tolerating decrease in midaz by 2 and fentanyl by 25 every shift.  Will
   stop haldol and increase seroquel to 75 TID.
   - add methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl.
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Weaning his drip sedations now that treating with haldol and
   seroquel.
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully since yesterday.
   - Will get HD today and a unit of pRBC
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   .
   # Fever: Continued low-grade temps, although none most recently. Has
   had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2 wks ago with
   Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for purulent
   appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the CVL
   grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should have
   covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Start antibiotics as above.

   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.

    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.  Had to
   start labetalol drip last night because could not control BP.  Stop
   drip for HD and reassess after HD session
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Try to restart home labetalol 600mg [**Hospital1 **] after HD

   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.

   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.

   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Active issues at this time include respiratory failure, altered mental status post-PEA arrest, acute on chronic renal failure, fever, anemia, labile blood pressures, hypoNa, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, right upper extremity swelling, and diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) insertion, percutaneous tracheostomy, bronchoscopy, and insertion of various central venous lines. He is currently receiving multiple medications, including sedatives, analgesics, antihypertensives, antibiotics, and anticonvulsants.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal a collapsed left lung with areas of atelectasis and free air under the right hemidiaphragm, likely due to the PEG tube placement. Microbiology reports indicate the presence of gram-positive cocci in pairs and gram-negative rods in the sputum sample.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG
   yesterday
   - Low grade fevers, secretions on L, L lobe collapse, gm (+) cocci and
   GNR--> start VAP treatment with cefipime, vanc, and cipro
   - weaning sedation in now that using PO haldol and seroquel.  Has been
   tolerating decrease in midaz by 2 and fentanyl by 25 every shift
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Weaning his drip sedations now that treating with haldol and
   seroquel.
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back

   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been

   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.  Had to
   start labetalol drip last night because could not control BP.  Stop
   drip for HD and reassess after HD session

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Active Issues:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to his mental status and inability to wean from the ventilator.
2. Agitation: The patient exhibits agitation and thrashing around when sedation is weaned, making it difficult to assess his cortex.
3. Fever: The patient has had low-grade fevers, and there is suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of improvement followed by agitation and unresponsiveness.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The etiology of ARF is unclear, but it is unlikely that the patient will regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.
6. Hypotension: The patient has labile blood pressures and requires careful monitoring and management.
7. Anemia: The patient has chronic and stable anemia, possibly related to renal disease or autoimmune conditions.
8. Endocrine issues: The patient has hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, likely"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill, elderly male with a history of multiple medical conditions, including hypertension, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone several procedures, including PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) and tracheostomy. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 of 0.4 and is being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's sputum is growing gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods, indicating a possible infection. Additionally, there may be subtle patchy infiltrates seen on the chest X-ray. Close monitoring and repeat CXR in the next 24 hours are recommended to rule out VAP.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been labile with episodes of hypertension. Labetalol has been initiated for blood pressure control.
3. Fever: The patient developed a fever in the past 24 hours, which could be due to an infection or another underlying cause. Further investigation is required to identify the source of infection.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 7.0 g/dL. Blood transfusion is planned to address the anemia.
5. End-stage renal disease (ESRD): The patient has acute renal failure, and his kidney function is deteriorating, as indicated by the increasing serum creatinine levels. Dialysis is"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs scheduled
   - ID consult, will appreciate their recs in terms of managing ABx and
   also helping find a source.
   - Surface echo to eval for vegetations.
   - will likely need to pull PICC and replace with new R IJ CVL
 now
   that pt is no longer intubated with ETT, he is not drooling as much,
   and hopefully line infxn with drool will not be an issue as it was in
   past. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the PICC, see below under
   less active/stable issues.
   - ABx as started yesterday: Cefipime, Linezolid, Cipro for L lobe
   collapse, GPC and GNR's on sputum
   - Consider broadening with Flagyl to cover anaerobes and gut flora
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - No more transfusions for now
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - [**Male First Name (un) **]
t give Labetalol while pt hypotense
   - Pt continues on Levophed for now, if unable to wean, would consider
   adding Vasopressin
   - Consider CT thorax to look for source
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG
   yesterday
   - Will defer trach mask trials/RSBI/SBT's in the setting of active
   febrility
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation. Currently off the Versed and using only
   Fentanyl and scheduled Seroquel. Stopped Haldol yesterday
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl.
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - Had HD yesterday
   - F/u with renal about next HD
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - Renal recs stopping AlOH and starting Renagel today 800 tid
 will
   do this today
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Had 1U PRBC transfusion yesterday
   - guaiac stools
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a history of cardiac arrest. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Active issues at this point include new spiking fevers, hypotension, infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and positive sputum culture), blood transfusion reaction (received 1 unit yesterday, no prior transfusions), possible drug reaction (recently started Keppra), or TTP (less likely). There is also a concern for abdominal perforation with free air under the diaphragm (although just had percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement).

The patient has a long course of Cefepime for a positive urine culture (Pseudomonas) about 2 weeks ago, and most recently, Linezolid was added for purulent appearing central venous line (CVL). One of the CVLs grew out Micrococcus, and according to ID, the Cefepime should have covered it. The patient received a 14-day course of Cefepime and a 9-day course of Linezolid.

Assessment and plan:
1. Fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin)
   - Hypertension, benign
   - Diarrhea
   - Altered mental status (not delirium)
   - Renal failure, end-stage (ESRD)
   - Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name])
   - Cardiac arrest

Less active/stable issues:
1. Anemia. Chronic and stable.?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs. related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Had 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion yesterday
   - Guaiac stools

2. Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low blood pressures and give prn for elevated blood pressures.

3. Endo: Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recommendations, have increased AlOH to 45 tid.

4. RUE swelling: Had ultrasound (u/s) that did not completely visualize subclavian vein, but was thought that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was unlikely. When pt had peripherally inserted central catheter"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
   # New spiking fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now
   with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got
   1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs scheduled
   - ABx as started yesterday: Cefipime, Linezolid, Cipro for L lobe
   collapse, GPC and GNR's on sputum
   - Consider broadening with Flagyl to cover anaerobes and gut flora
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile rxn still possible
   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - No more transfusions for now
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG
   yesterday
   - Will defer trach mask trials/RSBI/SBT's in the setting of active
   febrility
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation. Currently off the Versed and using only
   Fentanyl and scheduled Seroquel. Stopped Haldol yesterday
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl.
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back

   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Had 1U PRBC transfusion yesterday
   - guaiac stools
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Active issues at this point include:
1. New spiking fevers: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could be due to an infection or a drug reaction. It is also possible that the fevers are related to a blood transfusion reaction or abdominal perforation.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to possible hypoxia and has not been able to be weaned off the ventilator. There is a concern about pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed.
3. Altered mental status: The patient has had a decrease in mental status since his cardiac arrest. Sedation weaning has been attempted, but the patient becomes agitated and unresponsive. An MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function has worsened, and he may not regain enough function to be free of dialysis. He had a recent episode of hypotension and hypertension.

Less active/stable issues include:
1. Anemia: The patient has chronic and stable anemia, possibly related to renal disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ACD).
2. HypoNa: The patient had issues with hy"

   Patient with persistent fevers in past 36 hours and rising WBC. Now
   hypotensive as well - concern for sepsis. Cultures pending.  On broad
   spectrum antibiotics. Need to consider possible dialysis line infection
   concerning that his condition worsened post dialysis yesterday. Remove
   PIC. Abdominal exam benign except in region of recent PEG placment.
   Galactomannan being checked.    Consider echocardiogram to assess for
   cardiac vegetations.
   Would vasopressin to pressors given possible sepsis. Try to wean
   levophed. Difficult to assess intravascular volume, but lack of
   response to fluid boluses yesterday suggests that he is not
   significantly volume depleted.
   Had dialysis yesterday; electrolytes and acid-base status acceptable.
   Decreased level of responsiveness probably reflects delirium in setting
   of fevers.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have a history of renal failure, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, and anemia. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers for the past 36 hours and is now hypotensive, raising concerns for sepsis. Cultures have been pending, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a concern for a possible dialysis line infection, given the worsening condition after dialysis yesterday. The patient also has an abdominal exam that is benign except in the region of recent PEG placement. A galactomannan test is being conducted, and consideration is being given to an echocardiogram to assess for cardiac vegetations. The patient has been receiving vasopressor support due to possible sepsis. Efforts are being made to wean off levophed. It is difficult to assess intravascular volume, but a lack of response to fluid boluses suggests that the patient is not significantly volume depleted. The patient had dialysis yesterday, and their electrolytes and acid-base status are acceptable. Their level of responsiveness has decreased, likely reflecting delirium in the setting of fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers, hypotension, and rising white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. Cultures are pending to identify the source of infection.
2. Dialysis Line Infection"

   impressed w/ EKG.  Trop near his baseline and flat.  Got lopressor and
   SL nitro to control HTN and bottomed out.
   - Then spiked fever to 101.5 accompanied w/ hypotension. Given
   temporary Neo gtt.  Blood cx drawn.
   - ID consult: recommended stopping cipro and linezolid and starting
   zosyn and vancomycin with a slow infusion (given unclear history of
   allergy of rash) to start. Consider sucralfate instead of famotidine.
   - changed cipro for zosyn -> contact[**Name (NI) **] by pharmacy as they wanted us to
   consider tobramycin instead, but we are avoiding that b/c of his renal
   fxn.  Could discuss with renal, as transplant may not be salvageable.

   ICU Care
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs scheduled
   - Start zosyn and vancomycin (slow infusion given history of rash)
   - D/c cipro and linezolid and flagyl
   - f/u ID consult
   - will likely need to pull PICC (febrile, and it
s an older line) and
   replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the PICC,
   see below under less active/stable issues; also difficulty with CVL
   placement. Hold for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - no beta-blockers
   - Pt continues on Levophed for now, if unable to wean, would consider
   adding Vasopressin
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG placed
   on [**12-2**].
   - Pressure support trial
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, try to turn off the fentanyl. Currently
   off the Versed
   - Seroquel (have d/c
d haldol previously)
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean
   to 7.5mg tid.
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   -          f/u EKG
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD today
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - Increase ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement. If trach and PEG placed,
   could consider moving to vent rehab.

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been admitted to the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. The patient has a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT). They also have diabetes mellitus type II and hypertension. The patient is ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes following a cardiac arrest. 

Recent events include the patient experiencing fever spikes, hypotension, and transient ST elevations on EKG, which were associated with hypertension. The patient has also been diagnosed with an infection, as evidenced by positive sputum cultures for Micrococcus and pseudomonas. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a plump right vasculature and difficulty with central venous line placement. 

The patient's current medications include zosyn, vancomycin, famotidine, metoprolol, fentanyl, phenylephrine, and sucralfate. The patient's nutritional support consists of tube feeds through a tracheostomy tube. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from this case include sepsis due to ongoing infections, renal failure exacerbation, cardiovascular instability, and respiratory failure. 

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, infection parameters, renal function, and cardiovascular stability. Adjustments to the antibiotic regimen and fluid management may be necessary. Additionally, further"

 FEVER - 101.8
F - [**2107-12-4**] 08:00 AM
   - Pt had worrisome EKG changes for ischemia (transient ST elevations in
   the setting of hypertension). Improved as BP came down, cards not
   impressed w/ EKG.  Trop near his baseline and flat.  Got lopressor and
   SL nitro to control HTN and bottomed out.
   - Then spiked fever to 101.5 accompanied w/ hypotension. Given
   temporary Neo gtt.  Blood cx drawn.
   - ID consult: recommended stopping cipro and linezolid and starting
   zosyn and vancomycin with a slow infusion (given unclear history of
   allergy of rash) to start. Consider sucralfate instead of famotidine.
   - changed cipro for zosyn -> contact[**Name (NI) **] by pharmacy as they wanted us to
   consider tobramycin instead, but we are avoiding that b/c of his renal
   fxn.  Could discuss with renal, as transplant may not be salvageable.
   Didn't start vanco as it was late, can be attempted in AM.

   also helping find a source.
   - Surface echo to eval for vegetations.
   - will likely need to pull PICC and replace with new R IJ CVL
 now
   that pt is no longer intubated with ETT, he is not drooling as much,
   and hopefully line infxn with drool will not be an issue as it was in
   past. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the PICC, see below under
   less active/stable issues.
   - ABx as started yesterday: Cefipime, Linezolid, Cipro for L lobe
   collapse, GPC and GNR's on sputum
   - Consider broadening with Flagyl to cover anaerobes and gut flora
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood

   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but not recently.
   Continue to watch lytes qday.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose well-controlled now w/ sliding scale
   only.

   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, PPI
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.

The patient's recent events include worrisome EKG changes for ischemia, transient ST elevations in the setting of hypertension. His blood pressure has been intermittently hypotensive and hypertensive. He experienced a spike in fever to 101.5 accompanied by hypotension, for which temporary Neo gel was given. The patient also had an episode of hypotension and was given labetalol.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including cefepime, linezolid, and zosyn with vancomycin. His sputum cultures have shown growth of Micrococcus and GNRs. The patient's blood cultures are pending.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. His electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 85/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

The patient's respiratory support consists of a tracheostomy tube and mechanical"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old man with a medical history of chronic renal failure (CRF) who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is currently in respiratory failure. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, linezolid, and cefepime. He has also received treatment for possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 101.8°F, tachycardia with a heart rate of 115 beats per minute, hypertension with a blood pressure of 146/71 mmHg, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 100% on the ventilator. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 82.4 kg currently.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count with 14.5 thousand cells/mm³, increased creatinine levels ranging from 3.2 to 6.4 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including ALT and AST.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities, rhonchorous breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurological"

   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Spiking fevers up to 103.3.
   - CT with contrast to investigate possible abdominal process; renal ok
   with IV and po contrast, given graft failure
   - f/u C. diff and fungal cultures
   - Initiate Bactrim; confirm dosing with ID or pharmacy

   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically

   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - no beta-blockers
   - Wean off Levophed as tolerated
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG placed
   on [**12-2**].
   - d/c Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation and attempt to wean from
   vent
   - Decrease Methadone by
 dose
   - Pressure support trial
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean
   to 7.5mg tid; wean to half dose (11mg daily).
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH tomorrow
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - Increase ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), was admitted to the ICU for dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers, hypotension, and positive sputum cultures with Micrococcus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. His recent sputum culture showed coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including cefepime and linezolid, but continues to have fevers. He also has a history of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and is on dialysis.

The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of agitation and unresponsiveness. He has been on various sedatives, including propofol and versed, but still thrashes around and appears uncomfortable when sedation is weaned. Continuous EEG has shown epileptiform spikes, and he was started on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

The patient has anemia, which may be related to chronic renal disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). He is also experiencing labile blood pressures, transient ST elevations on EKG, hypoNa, and elevated PTH levels."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He had a cardiac arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has multiple medical complications, including infection, respiratory failure, altered mental status, labile blood pressures, anemia, and chronic renal failure. He is also on multiple medications and has a history of diabetes mellitus type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers, and there are positive cultures indicating an ongoing infection. The recent nasal swab and rectal swab were done to identify the source of infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently dependent on a ventilator. There is a concern for possible pneumonia, but the sputum cultures have been negative so far.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and he is showing signs of agitation and discomfort when sedation is weaned. This could be related to his ETT (endotracheal tube) or underlying neurological issues.
4. Labile Blood Pressures: The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and hypertension, which may be due to an infectious source or hypovolemia.
5. Anemia: The patient has chronic anemia, which could be related to his renal"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
    Active issues at this point:
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs scheduled
   - Start zosyn and vancomycin (slow infusion given history of rash)
   - D/c cipro and linezolid and flagyl
   - f/u ID consult
   - will likely need to pull PICC (febrile, and it
s an older line) and
   replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the PICC,
   see below under less active/stable issues; also difficulty with CVL
   placement. Hold for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - no beta-blockers
   - Pt continues on Levophed for now, if unable to wean, would consider
   adding Vasopressin
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG placed
   on [**12-2**].
   - Pressure support trial
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has been experiencing fever, hypotension, and agitation. He has multiple comorbidities including chronic anemia, hypoNa, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and diabetes type II.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive sputum cultures suggest a possible infection. Given his immunocompromised state due to chronic illnesses and medications, he is at increased risk for infections such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bloodstream infection.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's labile blood pressures indicate intermittent hypotension and hypertension. This could be due to an infectious source, hypovolemia, or medication effects. Close monitoring and adjustment of fluids and medications are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.

3. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with acute-on-chronic renal failure. He requires ongoing hemodialysis (HD) to manage fluid and electrolyte imbalances. The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear, and further evaluation is needed.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old man with respiratory failure, who has experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was febrile yesterday and required pressors, but has since been weaned off. The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin and has received various antibiotics, including linezolid, cefipime, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and vancomycin.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.3°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 110 bpm (with a normal range of 82-138 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 68/37 mmHg to 148/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (with a normal range of 18-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on a ventilator, set at a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 44 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 328, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 9.0 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the eyes, cardiovascular system, or abdomen. However, there is evidence of right and left lower extremity edema, and the patient's mental status is described as unresponsive.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), creatinine (Cr), troponin T, C-reactive protein (CRP), and lactate. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes fever, hypertension, diarrhea, altered mental status, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), acute respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, and sputum positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The plan includes adding bactrim to cover stenotrophomonas maltophilia, switching to pressure support ventilation (PSV), reducing methadone, continuing with keppra for seizures, and following the hemodialysis (HD) protocol.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to multi-drug resistant organisms, further deterioration of renal function, development of delirium or prolonged altered mental status, and complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

In summary, the patient is a critically ill 61-year-old man with respiratory failure, a history of PEA arrest, and multiple comorbidities. He is febrile"

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Spiking fevers up to 103.3.
   - CT with contrast to investigate possible abdominal process; renal ok
   with IV and po contrast, given graft failure
   - f/u C. diff and fungal cultures
   - Initiate Bactrim; confirm dosing with ID or pharmacy
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs scheduled
   - D/C zosyn and vancomycin (slow infusion given history of rash)
   - Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl
   - f/u ID consult; ask about investigating possible sinus infection and
   treatment
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - Consider stopping the Keppra --> talk to Neuro about this first
   though
   - no beta-blockers
   - Wean off Levophed as tolerated
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG placed
   on [**12-2**].
   - d/c Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation and attempt to wean from
   vent
   - Decrease Methadone by
 dose
   - Pressure support trial
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient obviously has intact
   brainstem reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI,
   though severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of
   acute ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation.
   He was making some strides towards improvement last week, with
   following commands and responding to the environment, but most recently
   he has just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is
   weaned, not following commands, not tracking across the room, not
   making progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of
   triglycerides of 700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell
   that was concerning for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG
   for a while, with epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure
   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean
   to 7.5mg tid; wean to half dose (11mg daily).
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH tomorrow
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - Increase ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and coronary artery disease. The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and was intubated due to respiratory failure. He also has an altered mental status post-cardiac arrest, which is believed to be due to hypoxic encephalopathy.

The patient's recent course has been complicated by multiple infections, including a positive sputum culture for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an antibiotic-resistant organism. He has been treated with various antibiotics, including cefepime, linezolid, and bactrim. However, he continues to have fevers, and his condition remains unstable.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and electrolyte imbalances. His blood pressure has been labile, ranging from hypotension to hypertension. He also has anemia and thrombocytopenia.

In terms of management, the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes have been placed. He is receiving hemodialysis via a left subclavian catheter. His nutrition is being provided through tube feeds. He is on multiple medications, including anticoagulation, antibiotics"

   activity. They recommended a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an
   extra 250 after HD.
   - He is currently written for Keppra 250mg IV q12, will need to clarify
   dose with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - Have added methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean
   to 7.5mg tid; wean to half dose (11mg daily).
   - F/u EKG daily because of Haldol/Seroquel use
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH tomorrow
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive.
   - Keep watching pressures
   - Hold Labetalol for low bp's and give prn for elevated bp's.
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - Increase ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, acute renal failure, and hypoxia. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including fever, hypertension, diarrhea, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been unstable, with intermittent hypotension and hypertension. He has a history of multiple infections, including a positive sputum culture for Staphylococcus aureus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications. He also has anemia, which is chronic and stable, and his renal function is further compromised due to acute-on-chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, positive sputum cultures, and systemic symptoms suggest a possible infection leading to sepsis.
2. Multidrug-resistant infection: The presence of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in the sputum culture indicates a potential multidrug-resistant infection.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent deterioration in renal function, along with the need for dialysis, suggests the development of AKI.
4. Hypertensive emergency: The patient's elevated blood pressure readings and signs of end-"

    # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
   - D/C Nitro drip
   - Initiate Labetalol drip with low dose po Labetalol for goal BP ~150
   given tenuous BP status.
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl.
   - CT with contrast to investigate possible abdominal process; renal ok
   with IV and po contrast, given graft failure
   - Continue Bactrim; confirm dosing with ID or pharmacy
   - f/u C. diff and fungal cultures
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - Monitor status of possible sinus infection given current clinical
   improvement and active drainage
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - Wean off Levophed as tolerated
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
    # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s negative to
   date.  Main hindrance to weaning from vent is his agitation, whenever
   his sedation is weaning he thrashes around, isn
t responsive, looks
   very uncomfortable, drools a lot. This agitation could be in large part
   due to his ETT and we should move towards trach.  Trach and PEG placed
   on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation, d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam
   sedation.
   - Attempt to wean from vent
   - Decrease Methadone by
 dose but ?withdrawal so increased back to
   10mg tid.  Consider slow taper.
   - Pressure support trial today.
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean to slowly
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - 2 units PRBC per Renal recs
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH possibly today pending renal recs
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.

He has a history of chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and congestive heart failure. The patient experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Recent events include:

1. Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (RUQ) showed no evidence of thrombus.
2. CT abdomen revealed a small thrombus in the inferior vena cava (IVC) and at the junction of the right common iliac vein and transplanted renal vein.
3. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
4. Bactrim IV was initiated for sputum findings.
5. Vancomycin and Zosyn were discontinued.
6. Stress dose steroids were not administered as recommended by the renal team.
7. The patient was found to have a sinus infection, and Infectious Disease consultation was requested.
8. Methadone was decreased from 10mg tid to 5mg tid but was increased back to 10mg tid due to withdrawal symptoms.

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.
   - Attempt to wean from vent
   - Decrease Methadone by
 dose but ?withdrawal so increased back to
   10mg tid.  Consider slow taper.
   - Pressure support trial did not go well last night.  Was not pulling
   the volumes needed and was tachypneic
   - Return to seroquel PRN
   .
   # New spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - CT with contrast to investigate possible abdominal process; renal ok
   with IV and po contrast, given graft failure
   - Continue Bactrim; confirm dosing with ID or pharmacy
   - f/u C. diff and fungal cultures
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - Monitor status of possible sinus infection given current clinical
   improvement and active drainage
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
   - Labetalol drip with low dose po Labetalol for goal BP ~150 given
   tenuous BP status.
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean to slowly
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - HD Friday and assess need for blood products at this time.
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH possibly today pending renal recs
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement. If trach and PEG placed,
   could consider moving to vent rehab.
","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has had multiple medical complications including a possible pneumonia, sepsis, drug reactions, and transfusion reactions. He has also had issues with hypertension and hypotension, anemia, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure of 162/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination reveals a systolic murmur, clear to somewhat cloudy chest with interstitial edema, distended abdomen, and no extremity edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's sputum cultures have grown gram-negative rods and coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Imaging shows no new consolidation but minimal interstitial edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, potential pneumonia, infection (possibly from blood transfusion or drug reaction), drug reactions, and altered mental status. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, antidiabetics, and seizure medication.

   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
   - Labetalol drip with low dose po Labetalol for goal BP ~150 given
   tenuous BP status.
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 10mg TID to assist with weaning fentanyl; wean to slowly
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.
   - HD Friday and assess need for blood products at this time.
   .
   - Doesn't appear to be DIC, or hemolysis
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   - F/u with Heme Onc about the smear that was collected, specifically
   looking for shistos
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH possibly today pending renal recs
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement. If trach and PEG placed,

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes following a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease.

The patient's recent progress includes improved interstitial edema, minimal new consolidation on chest imaging, and positive sputum cultures for Gram-negative rods (GNR) and coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. He was previously treated with cefepime and linezolid for a positive urine culture growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but now has been started on bactrim for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is sensitive to this antibiotic.

The patient's current assessment and plan include respiratory failure, possible pneumonia, and ongoing infection indicated by spiking fevers. He is being weaned off sedation, and his mental status has improved with the addition of keppra for possible subclinical seizures. Blood pressure management is challenging, with intermittent hypotension and hypertension.

Other issues include anemia of chronic disease (ACD) versus renal disease, acute on chronic renal failure, and various medication adjustments related to his renal condition. There are also less active/stable issues such as transient ST elevations on EKG, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, hyperph"

   Assessment and Plan
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Trach mask again today
   - Decrease Methadone to 5 today x 3 days and begin to wean
   - Return to zyprexa PRN
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed). No fevers overnight
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - f/u C. diff and fungal cultures
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - Add on beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and prednisone)
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
   - d/c labetalol drip and change PO labetalol dose to 800 TID from 600
   TID
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis
   - HD Friday and assess need for blood products at this time.
   - EPO at HD
   - Guiac stools
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD MWF
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: pending rehab placement if can wean from vent.  [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 273**]

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and has been ventilator-dependent since then.

The patient's recent events include arterial line removal, tracheostomy tube trial, and agitation caused by high CO2 levels. He has been receiving various medications including Zyprexa, Bactrim, cefepime, and linezolid. The patient's allergies include vancomycin, which caused a rash.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure of 144/61 mmHg, heart rate of 67 bpm, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and he has a 2/6 systolic murmur. His abdomen is distended but soft, and he has warm, well-perfused extremities without edema.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.2 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 135 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 6"

   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD yesterday; HD vs. CVVH possibly today pending renal recs
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - AlOH discontinued previously
   - On Renagel 800 tid.  D/C Sevelemer and initiate Amphagel.
   - Have stopped calcitriol and increased aluminum hydroxide per renal
   recs
   - Renal is following
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement. If trach and PEG placed,
   could consider moving to vent rehab.
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of the PEA arrest and subsequent mental status changes. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) is being provided through a tracheostomy tube.

2. Infection: The patient has been experiencing spiking fevers and hypotension, which may indicate an infection. Recent sputum cultures have grown Micrococcus and coag-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is currently on Bactrim for a presumed pneumonia, but further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had labile blood pressures, ranging from hypotensive to hypertensive episodes. This may be due to an infectious source or hypovolemia. Labetalol is being used to control blood pressure.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient has intact brainstem reflexes but shows agitation and altered mental status. This could be a result of the PEA arrest and the weaning of sedation. Continuous EEG has shown epileptiform"

   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.

   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Trach mask again today
   - Decreased Methadone to 5 to wean.  Continue at current dose for
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hypertensive today in setting of having morning dose of PO labetalol
   held.  Change parameters to hold if below SBP <120 and continue
   Labetalol 800 TID
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.  Decrease in hct today without evidence of active
   bleed.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).   Currently afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)

    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence

   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.

   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.

   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.

   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale

","The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He is currently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient had emesis during morning rounds and aspirated tube feeds. The risk for aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia is present. Monitoring the patient for signs of infection, such as fever, and holding tube feeds may be necessary.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was originally intubated in the setting of arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand. There is a question about whether he truly has pneumonia or not. Some atelectasis or infiltrates seen on chest X-rays may need to be further evaluated.

3. Hypertension: The patient has been intermittently hypertensive, and labetalol was given. He is now persistently hypertensive. Adjusting the antihypertensive medication may be necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient has chronic and stable anemia, possibly related to renal disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Further evaluation, such as repeat Hct and EPO at HD, is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM) type II. He was admitted with dyspnea, acute renal failure (ARF), and now requires mechanical ventilation due to mental status changes. The patient has been intermittently hypotensive and hypertensive, and his blood pressure is currently well-controlled with oral labetalol. He is febrile, and his fever curve is trending down after starting Bactrim. The patient has a history of chronic anemia, which may be related to renal disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (ACD). He has also been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC), and is being treated with heparin and Coumadin. The patient's renal function is acute on chronic, and he is on chronic hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. He has been started on renal replacement therapy with continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) but has not been functioning well. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of improved interaction and following commands, but recent agitation and thrashing around. He has been on continuous EEG, which showed epileptiform spikes but no seizure activity. He was given a load of Keppra, and his mental status has improved. The patient has a"

   bolus without effect. Started on phenylephrine (neo) with goal MAP >60.
   BP responding to pressor now.
   Patient low-grade febrile, rising white count, hypotension, so started
   on vanc, zosyn, flagyl (to cover gram positive in sputum, gram
   negatives broadly, and aspiration event from yesterday).
   Given 2 units of pRBC but without any Hct rise. Concern for bleed -

 CARDIAC ARREST
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Hct stable despite 2 units pRBC: DIC and hemolysis labs negative,
   consider bleed.
   - transfuse 2 units pRBC
   - repeat PM CBC, DIC panel, hemolysis labs
   - f/u Hct after 2 unit transfusion
   - get another peripheral IV
   - crossmatch 4 units
   - torso scan CT with contrast and head CT with contrast, to look for
   internal bleed site
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.
   - continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - d/c flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and
   feel zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u c.diff
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Monitor PO2 and respiratory status
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV
   - f/u CXR read; CXR tomorrow
   - cont zosyn to cover for anaerobes
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Pressure support
   - Decreased Methadone to 5 to wean.  Continue at current dose for
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   - pm ABG
   .
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   - if see any evidence for bleed on CT (given stable Hct in setting of 2
   transfusions pRBC), d/c heparin gtt (however continue it for now)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, coumadin, sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place. Consider placing a-line given on
   pressors today.

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Hct stable despite 2 units pRBC: DIC and hemolysis labs negative,
   consider bleed.
   - transfuse 4 units pRBC
   - f/u Hct
   - get another peripheral IV
   - crossmatch 4 units
   - abdominal scan CT to look for bleed, as distended and more tense on
   exam
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis.
   - continue neo
   - vanc, cefepime, flagyl
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   - Monitor PO2 and respiratory status
   - Hold tube feeds for the morning
   - f/u CXR read
   - cont flagyl
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Trach mask again today
   - Decreased Methadone to 5 to wean.  Continue at current dose for
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
     # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hypertensive today in setting of having morning dose of PO labetalol
   held.  Change parameters to hold if below SBP <120 and continue
   Labetalol 800 TID
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Anemia.  Chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.  Decrease in hct today without evidence of active
   bleed.
   - Repeat Hct this afternoon.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: Infection (recent sputum with
   Micrococcus and now with positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood
   transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't received transfusions
   before this), possible drug reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP
   (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with free air under diaphragm
   (although just had PEG placed).   Currently afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - no beta-blockers
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h for now, will discuss with Neuro
   - Continue weaning sedation, as above.
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - HD MWF
   - Continue cellcept/prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD
   unstable.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, tube feeds (Novasource Renal)
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin, discontinue famotidine and instead
   start sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. 

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including fever, hypotension, anemia, respiratory failure, altered mental status, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The fever is likely due to an infection, possibly pneumonia or urinary tract infection, as indicated by the positive sputum culture showing Gram-negative rods and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The hypotension may be caused by sepsis or blood transfusion reaction, but further evaluation is needed. The anemia is chronic and stable, possibly related to renal disease or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The respiratory failure may be secondary to aspiration pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The altered mental status is likely due to the PEA arrest and may be contributing to seizures, as indicated by the staring spells and epileptiform spikes on EEG. The DVT is a concern, especially with the presence of an inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics (cefepime, vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, metronidazole), antihypertensives (labetalol), anticoagulants (heparin, coumadin), and dialysis (CVVH, HD). Additionally, the patient is on renal replacement therapy with peritoneal dialysis (PD) and has been prescribed medications such as epoetin-alpha (EPO) and Sevelemer.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple organ dysfunctions requiring careful management. It is important to address the ongoing infections, optimize glycemic control, manage blood pressure, and monitor for any further complications."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They were previously on invasive ventilation but it was stopped. The patient has developed a fever of 101.4°F and has been experiencing low blood pressure despite IV fluids. They are anuric on hemodialysis and have shown signs of improvement after being started on Neo. The patient's white blood cell count is increasing and gram-positive cocci have been found in their sputum. They have been started on vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, increasing white blood cell count, and hypotension despite IV fluids indicate a possible sepsis. This could be due to a respiratory or urinary source, or possibly an intra-abdominal infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning with acute respiratory failure. They were previously on CPAP/PSV mode but have been put back on PSV. There is a new opacity seen in their left apex on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible pneumonia or pulmonary embolism.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is fluctuating between being somnolent and obtunded. This could be due to the underlying medical conditions or possibly related to sepsis.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient is anuric on hemodialysis, indicating a possible acute kidney injury. Further evaluation and management of renal"

   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units PRBC
   - General surgery consult for possible PEG placement as cause of liver
   hematoma
   - Consult IR regarding possible embolization for hepatic hematoma
   - trend Hct and coags q6h; transfuse as needed
   - get another peripheral IV
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   - repeat PM CBC, DIC panel, hemolysis labs
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - d/c flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and
   feel zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   -  c.diff negative
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV
   - f/u CXR final read
   - cont zosyn to cover for anaerobes
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable.
   - Morphine 1mg q4h prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   - if see any evidence for bleed on CT (given stable Hct in setting of 2
   transfusions pRBC), d/c heparin gtt (however continue it for now)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian

   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and was intubated due to possible hypoxia. The patient has a history of chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic renal failure. He is currently ventilator-dependent and has altered mental status.

Medical Complications:
1. Liver hematoma: The patient has a liver hematoma that is causing difficulties in reversing the bleed. General surgery and interventional radiology (IR) consultations have been obtained for further management.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, with infectious source suspected. Antibiotics have been initiated, and the patient is being closely monitored.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased significantly, and blood transfusions have been given. The cause of anemia is unclear, but it may be related to renal disease or acute blood loss.
4. Fever: The patient has had spiking fevers, which could be due to infection or a febrile transfusion reaction. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.
5. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and he requires dialysis. His renal failure is acute on chronic, and he may not regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.

   .
   # Hct stable despite 2 units pRBC: DIC and hemolysis labs negative,
   consider bleed.  CT showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing
   bleed.
   - transfuse 2 units pRBC
   - repeat PM CBC, DIC panel, hemolysis labs
   - f/u Hct after 2 unit transfusion
   - get another peripheral IV
   - crossmatch 4 units
   - torso scan CT with contrast and head CT with contrast, to look for
   internal bleed site
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters
   - continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - d/c flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and
   feel zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   -  c.diff negative
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Monitor PO2 and respiratory status
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV
   - f/u CXR read; CXR tomorrow
   - cont zosyn to cover for anaerobes
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Pressure support
   - Decreased Methadone to 5 to wean.  Continue at current dose for
   today.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   - pm ABG
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   - if see any evidence for bleed on CT (given stable Hct in setting of 2
   transfusions pRBC), d/c heparin gtt (however continue it for now)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, coumadin, sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: L art line which has been intermittently working and not
   working, may need to be replaced at some point. R PICC placed [**11-23**] now
   also reportedly not working, and may need to be pulled due to fevers,
   and if so, will need to have new central line placed. New L subclavian
   HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this line given
   how difficult it was to place. Consider placing a-line given on
   pressors today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He now requires mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic renal failure. He was previously on chronic hemodialysis (HD) and had a cardiac arrest.

Current issues:
1. Hypotension: The patient is intermittently hypotensive, with blood pressures ranging from 66 mmHg to 190/100 mmHg. It is unclear if the hypotension is due to an infectious source or volume loss. The patient is on neo and Labetalol to manage blood pressure.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is low at 19.6%. The anemia is likely related to chronic kidney disease (CKD) or blood loss. The patient has received two units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) but continues to have a declining Hct. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the anemia.
3. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient has had spiking fevers, suggesting an infection. Cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been started empirically. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to severe hypoxia"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units PRBC
   - General surgery consult for possible PEG placement as cause of liver
   hematoma
   - Consult IR regarding possible embolization for hepatic hematoma
   - trend Hct and coags q6h; transfuse as needed
   - get another peripheral IV
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   - repeat PM CBC, DIC panel, hemolysis labs
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - d/c flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and
   feel zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   -  c.diff negative
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV
   - f/u CXR final read
   - cont zosyn to cover for anaerobes
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable.
   - Morphine 1mg q4h prn
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin
   - Daily INR
   - Coumadin 5mg PO daily
   - D/c heparin drip when has been therapeutic (INR between [**2-8**] for 24
   hours).  Ok to go to rehab on heparin drip.
   - if see any evidence for bleed on CT (given stable Hct in setting of 2
   transfusions pRBC), d/c heparin gtt (however continue it for now)
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, coumadin, sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new
   central line placed. New L subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be
   very hesitant to pull this line given how difficult it was to place.
   Consider placing a-line given on pressors today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and is now ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, anemia, fever, respiratory failure, hyponatremia, pain, and labile blood pressures. He also has a liver hematoma and a history of aspiration.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's hypotension may be due to infectious sources or blood loss. Sputum culture shows gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Continue neo with goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60, and continue vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely secondary to blood loss or chronic renal disease. Erythropoietin (EPO) at hemodialysis (HD).
3. Fever: The patient has had spiking fevers, which could be due to infection or transfusion reaction. Infection workup is ongoing.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient initially intubated in setting of arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand. Consider pneumonia versus aspiration pneumonitis. Continue Bactrim until December 15th.
5. Liver hematoma: The patient has"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of PEA arrest, hepatic hematoma, and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving HD (likely meaning hemodialysis) and has had a large left hepatic hematoma discovered on a CT scan. The patient has received transfusions of 6 units of packed red blood cells and 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma overnight. The patient has allergies to vancomycin and has received multiple doses of antibiotics. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a history of anemia, and is experiencing hypotension, fever, hypertension, diarrhea, altered mental status, renal failure, and respiratory failure. The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, acute blood loss anemia, DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation), sinus infection, subclinical seizures, thromboses, and CRF (chronic renal failure) requiring dialysis three times a week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. This can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has received a significant amount of blood transfusions, indicating a possible acute blood loss. This can result in anemia, which can compromise oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coag"

 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct <28; had stable hct
   yesterday, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - pO2 on venous ABG 40; maintain current vent settings
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Consider Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing
   respiratory status
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
   # Fevers/Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs
   and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO while acute GI problems resolve
   - change oral meds to IV; not receiving Methadone
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Increase Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Continue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   - Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - IV labetalol prn for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new
   central line placed. L subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very
   hesitant to pull this line given how difficult it was to place.
   Consider placing a-line given on pressors today.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications including hypotension, anemia, fever, respiratory failure, liver hematoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic renal failure. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI).

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, possibly due to infectious sources or blood loss. Sepsis and hypovolemia are being considered as potential causes. The patient is on neo (likely neosulfocystamine), a vasopressor, to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg. Continuing neo with goal MAP >60, and f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures) are recommended.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Erythropoietin (EPO) will be given during hemodialysis (HD) to help stimulate red blood cell production.
3. Fever: The patient has had spiking fevers, possibly due to infection or transfusion reaction."

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.
   - Monitor coags and Hct q8h, transfuse for Hct <28; had stable hct
   today, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - 1 unit PRBC today for Hct 26
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - pO2 on ABG 40; will need to increase FIO2 or PEEP to increase
   oxygenation.
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing respiratory status
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV; not receiving Methadone
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable.
   - Morphine 1mg q4h prn
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin.  All
   anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   - Daily INR
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p [**Month (only) **] arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, coumadin, sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new
   central line placed. New L subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be
   very hesitant to pull this line given how difficult it was to place.
   Consider placing a-line given on pressors today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type II. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is s/p continuous renal replacement therapy (CRT). He has been on dialysis three times a week.

The patient has had multiple complications, including a liver hematoma, which was not related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, as determined by general surgery. The hematoma was managed conservatively with close monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) and coagulation parameters. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and was bridged with heparin due to venous thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC).

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, with intermittent hypotension and hypertension. He was intubated during cardiac arrest and had evidence of aspiration, but the distinction between aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia is unclear. He was placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and later switched to Bactrim as the fever trended down. The sputum culture revealed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which is sensitive to Bactrim."

   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.
   - Monitor coags and Hct q8h, transfuse for Hct <28; had stable hct
   today, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - 1 unit PRBC today for Hct 26
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - pO2 on ABG 40; will need to increase FIO2 or PEEP to increase
   oxygenation.
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing respiratory status
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   - avoid sedation d/t AMS if possible
   .
   # Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO
   - change oral meds to IV; not receiving Methadone
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable.
   - Morphine 1mg q4h prn
   .
   DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels including
   his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with coumadin.  All
   anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   - Daily INR
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**].
   - Hold antihypertensives while on pressors, but have IV labetalol
   available for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis: Heparin gtt, coumadin, sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new
   central line placed. New L subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be
   very hesitant to pull this line given how difficult it was to place.
   Consider placing a-line given on pressors today.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He subsequently experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and is now ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic kidney disease. He is currently on multiple medications including hydrocortisone, morphine, midazolam, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, Bactrim, and Keppra.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, which could be due to an infectious source or hypovolemia. He is currently on a neorodrenaline drip with a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of >60 mmHg.
2. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers, which may be attributed to an infection or a febrile transfusion reaction. Further investigations are needed to determine the cause.
3. Liver Hematoma: The patient has a liver hematoma, likely secondary to a recent procedure. There is concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Monitoring of hematocrit (Hct) and coagulation parameters is ongoing, and transfusion is being considered to maintain an Hct >20%.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for respiratory failure, which occurred in the setting of a cardiac arrest. There is some question about whether he has pneumonia or atelectasis, and cultures have revealed growth of Gram-negative rods and coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus.
5. Aspiration: The patient aspirated tube feeds, but the respiratory therapist and nurse were able to suction out the aspirate. There is concern for aspiration pneumonitis versus aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotics have been held until the patient shows signs of infection.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been found to have venous thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC). He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with warfarin. Anticoagulation was temporarily stopped due to the liver hematoma but has since been restarted.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely due to chronic disease or acute blood loss. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been started at dialysis.
8. Hyponatremia: The patient had hyponatremia, which has since resolved.
9. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient had elevated potassium and phosphorus levels, likely secondary to renal failure. Alkaline hydroxide has been increased to 45 tablets per day.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple medical problems following a cardiac arrest. He has respiratory failure, ongoing fevers, and a large hepatic hematoma. The patient's altered mental status has worsened today. He is being treated with morphine and versed for pain control, and his respiratory failure is being managed with assisted ventilation. He is also on vancomycin and Zosyn for fevers and elevated white blood cell count, as well as Bactrim for stenotrophomonas. Thromboses are being prevented with heparin in the setting of the liver hematoma. The patient is undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates an inability to adequately breathe on his own. This can lead to complications such as hypoxemia (low oxygen levels), hypercapnia (high carbon dioxide levels), and respiratory acidosis.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which means his kidneys are not functioning properly. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the buildup of waste products in the body.
3. Fever and Elevated White Blood Cell Count: The patient's ongoing fevers and elevated WBC count suggest an ongoing infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Hepatic Hematoma: The patient has a"

   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct <28; had stable hct
   yesterday, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Fevers/Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs
   and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis.
   - Peripheral smear, diff
   - ID consult
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Hydrocort stress dose steroids
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes); consider
   DISCONTINUING Vanc given GNR in sputum
   - NPO while acute GI problems resolve
   - change oral meds to IV; not receiving Methadone
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - pO2 on venous ABG 40; maintain current vent settings
   - Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Consider Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing
   respiratory status
   - Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Increase Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Continue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   - Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - IV labetalol prn for SBP >160 prn.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs
   - CT head with contrast today
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   - hold sedation
   - methadone 5mg TID to assist with weaning from narcotic dependence
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now also reportedly not working, and may
   need to be pulled due to fevers, and if so, will need to have new
   central line placed. L subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very
   hesitant to pull this line given how difficult it was to place.
   Consider placing a-line given on pressors today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus (DM).
- The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues, including hypotension, anemia, fever, respiratory failure, liver hematoma, and multiple infections.
- He has been treated with various medications and interventions, including blood transfusions, antibiotics, anticoagulation, and dialysis.
- The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of alertness and agitation. He has had episodes of seizures and is currently on antiepileptic medication.
- Imaging studies have shown evidence of pneumonia, atelectasis, and thrombi in the veins, including the inferior vena cava (IVC).
- The patient's renal function remains unstable, and he requires ongoing hemodialysis.
- There are several less active or stable issues, such as anemia, hyponatremia, ST elevations on EKG, and swelling in the right upper extremity (RUE).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the following potential medical complications can be identified:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to aspiration pneumonia and atelectasis. Continued respiratory support may be necessary.

 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest, now ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct <28; had stable hct
   yesterday, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Fevers/Hypotension: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs
   and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis.
   - Peripheral smear, diff
   - Continue neo with goal MAP >60
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Change Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent today due to tenuous status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO while acute GI problems resolve
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - pO2 on venous ABG 40; maintain current vent settings
   - Discontinue Methadone 5mg; patient cannot get while NPO.
   - Consider Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing
   respiratory status
   - Discontinue Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Discontinue Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Discontinue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   - Re-start Seroquel 25mg tid
   - Fentanyl IV
   - EKG
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma and risk of
   bleed.
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - Labetalol drip
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - f/u beta-glucan and galactomannan
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 250mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**]
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if HD unstable.
   Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, anemia, fever, respiratory failure, liver hematoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic renal failure. He has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, blood transfusions, and dialysis. The patient's current condition is unstable with ongoing respiratory issues, agitation, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive sputum cultures suggest an ongoing infection. This could lead to sepsis, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to chronic renal failure and diabetes.
2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient's recent aspiration event increases the risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. His current symptoms, such as fever and worsening respiratory status, may be indicative of this condition.
3. Liver Hematoma: The patient has a liver hematoma, which could potentially lead to bleeding complications if it continues to grow or ruptures.
4. DVT: The patient has evidence of venous thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC). This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not properly managed.
5. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his renal function is expected to worsen, potentially requiring more frequent dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
6. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's persistent hypertension may lead to hypertensive emergency if not controlled promptly.
7. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and agitation could be indicative of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with multiple problems following a cardiac arrest, including respiratory failure, ongoing fevers with elevated white blood cell count, large hepatic hematoma, and end-stage renal disease.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension (not in shock), acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), fever (hypothermia, pyrexia, not fever of unknown origin), benign hypertension, diarrhea, altered mental status (not delirium), and acute respiratory failure (not ARDS).

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 146/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals scleral erythema, symmetric chest expansion with rhonchorous breath sounds, distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness upon light palpation, absence of lower extremity edema, warm skin, and no neurologic assessment due to encephalopathy.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL and elevated white blood cell count of 41.4 K/uL. Other lab values show elevated creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's treatment plan includes restarting fentanyl for pain management"

   Imaging: [**2107-12-15**]  CXR done
   [**2107-12-14**] CXR  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
   relevant change. The positions of the tracheostomy tube and the
   bilateral central venous access lines are unchanged. An area of
   plate-like atelectasis emanating from the left hilus is slightly more
   extensive than on the previous examination. In turn, some preexisting
   vascular enlargement in the right lung is slightly less pronounced. The
   size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No evidence of newly
   appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Mild overhydration
   could be present.
   [**2107-12-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to multifocal
   synchronous epileptic abnormalities compatible with epileptiform
   discharges in the setting of a severe encephalopathy with multifocal
   structural pathology. Clinical correlation is recommended. The
   background rhythm was slow and disorganized consistent with a moderate
   to severe encephalopathy. Note is also made of suppressive bursts of
   the background rhythm which appear to be more pronounced in the right
   hemisphere suggestive of possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
   No electrographic seizures were seen during this recording; however,
   given the frequency of epileptic discharges, a repeat study or
   continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for further evaluation.

   s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse as needed to keep Hct >20; had
   stable hct x 2 dats, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of
   PTT/INR.
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Fevers: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T
   on  [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   - Peripheral smear, diff - unremarkable
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u aspergillus study
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.
   - working to wean vent
 pt on CPAP this am ([**5-20**])
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - will restart tube feeding slowly today
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, will wean as tolerated
   - ABG today as above
   - Now on Seroquel TID and Fentanyl boluses prn pain/agitation.
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Discontinue Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Discontinue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   - Fentanyl IV
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   -          Labetalol drip
 turned off overnight, now on Hydralazine Q6
   hours with reasonable control.
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p [**Month/Day (4) **] arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**]
   - Order placed for 24hour video EEG monitoring.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See fever section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved. Monitoring sodium.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration
 NPO, but will
   re-start tube feeds slowly today
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU care given acute developments.
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has been admitted multiple times with various health issues. The note outlines the patient's current condition and the treatment plan. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to several factors such as sepsis, hepatic encephalopathy, or medication side effects.

2. Hypertension: The patient has been intermittently hypertensive, and it is unclear whether this is due to an infectious source or hypovolemia.

3. Fever (Hypothermia, Pyrexia, Not Fever of Unknown Origin): The patient has had episodes of fever, and the cause is still uncertain. It could be related to an infection, transfusion reaction, drug reaction, or other underlying conditions.

4. Diarrhea: The patient has experienced diarrhea, which may be caused by antibiotics or an underlying gastrointestinal infection.

5. Respiratory Failure, Acute (Not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name]): The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about aspiration pneumonia, but further evaluation is needed.

6. Liver Hematoma: The patient has a liver hematoma, possibly related to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or a bleeding disorder. This condition requires careful monitoring and management.

7. Aspiration: The patient had an episode of aspiration during tube feeding, leading to concerns about aspiration pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia.

8. Pain: The patient appears to be in pain and discomfort, likely due to stretching of the hepatic capsule caused by the hematoma.

9. DVT: The patient has venous thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC). Anticoagulation therapy was initiated but had to be temporarily stopped due to the liver hematoma.

10. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, possibly due to chronic kidney disease or another underlying cause. Erythropoietin (EPO) is being administered during hemodialysis.

11. Hyponatremia: The patient had issues with low sodium levels, which have since resolved. Monitoring of sodium levels is ongoing.

12. ST Elevations: Transient ST elevations were observed on the patient's electrocardiogram (EKG), which resolved. This may be related to tachycardia and hypertension.

13. RUE Swelling: The patient has swelling in the right upper extremity (RUE), likely due to a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein. This requires consideration for a percutaneous intervention.

14. DM Type II: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, which is currently being managed with sliding-scale insulin.

It is important to note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note, and further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to confirm or rule out these conditions."

   Imaging: [**2107-12-15**]  CXR done
   [**2107-12-14**] CXR  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
   relevant change. The positions of the tracheostomy tube and the
   bilateral central venous access lines are unchanged. An area of
   plate-like atelectasis emanating from the left hilus is slightly more
   extensive than on the previous examination. In turn, some preexisting
   vascular enlargement in the right lung is slightly less pronounced. The
   size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No evidence of newly
   appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Mild overhydration
   could be present.
   [**2107-12-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to multifocal
   synchronous epileptic abnormalities compatible with epileptiform
   discharges in the setting of a severe encephalopathy with multifocal
   structural pathology. Clinical correlation is recommended. The
   background rhythm was slow and disorganized consistent with a moderate
   to severe encephalopathy. Note is also made of suppressive bursts of
   the background rhythm which appear to be more pronounced in the right
   hemisphere suggestive of possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
   No electrographic seizures were seen during this recording; however,
   given the frequency of epileptic discharges, a repeat study or
   continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for further evaluation.

 DIARRHEA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended monitoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 20; had fairly stable
   hct x 2 days, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Active T&S; crossmatch 4 units
   .
   # Fevers: Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis,
   versus hypotension secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC
   in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with
   zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C.
   diff negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis.  Last
   elevated Tm 101.9 was on [**2107-12-12**].
   - Peripheral smear, diff ordered
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Change Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent due to poor mental status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO while acute GI problems resolve
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - no recent ABG, will order one for today
   - Could consider Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing
   respiratory status
   - Discontinue Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Discontinue Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Discontinue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   - Re-start Seroquel 25mg tid
   - Fentanyl IV
   - EKG
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma and risk of
   bleed.
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - Labetalol drip
 turned off overnight
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Pt initially required Neo (pressor) to maintain MAP > 60
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p [**Month (only) **] arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**]
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   .
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: Family meeting regarding goals of care.  ICU care given
   acute developments.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced cardiac arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter. The patient is now ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including delirium, hypertension, fever of unknown origin, diarrhea, respiratory failure, liver hematoma, aspiration pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and acute on chronic renal failure. He also has a history of diabetes mellitus type II.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure of 137/58 mmHg (118/52 mmHg), respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and renal function.

The patient has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, antihypertensives, antiepileptics, and supportive care. He is currently on hemodialysis three times a week and receives erythropoietin during each session. The patient's family has been consulted regarding the goals of care, and he remains in the ICU for further management"

   Chief Complaint: - pt with episodes of rigoring, although afebrile,
   with associated diaphoresis and hypertension. unclear whether due to
   bacteremia or pain or Vancomycin allergy or seizure activity. blood
   cultures from HD line sent, benadryl given (without much improvement),
   Keppra increased from 250 to 500mg [**Hospital1 **], hydral 25mg PO q6 started, and

   Imaging: [**2107-12-15**]  CXR done
   [**2107-12-14**] CXR  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
   relevant change. The positions of the tracheostomy tube and the
   bilateral central venous access lines are unchanged. An area of
   plate-like atelectasis emanating from the left hilus is slightly more
   extensive than on the previous examination. In turn, some preexisting
   vascular enlargement in the right lung is slightly less pronounced. The
   size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No evidence of newly
   appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Mild overhydration
   could be present.
   [**2107-12-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to multifocal
   synchronous epileptic abnormalities compatible with epileptiform
   discharges in the setting of a severe encephalopathy with multifocal
   structural pathology. Clinical correlation is recommended. The
   background rhythm was slow and disorganized consistent with a moderate
   to severe encephalopathy. Note is also made of suppressive bursts of
   the background rhythm which appear to be more pronounced in the right
   hemisphere suggestive of possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
   No electrographic seizures were seen during this recording; however,
   given the frequency of epileptic discharges, a repeat study or
   continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for further evaluation.

   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - Change Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt continues to be febrile following
   aspiration event.
   - not weaning vent due to poor mental status
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - NPO while acute GI problems resolve
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.
   - Patient back on CMV/AC
   - no recent ABG, will order one for today
   - Could consider Presedex to help calm agitation without depressing
   respiratory status
   - Discontinue Zyprexa PRN agitation
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma.
   - Discontinue Morphine to 4mg q2h prn
   - Discontinue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   - Re-start Seroquel 25mg tid
   - Fentanyl IV
   - EKG
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma and risk of
   bleed.
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - Labetalol drip
 turned off overnight
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See hypotension section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**]
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   .
   # HypoNa: Had been having issues with hyponatremia, but has since
   resolved.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration - NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID)
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)

   Disposition: Family meeting regarding goals of care.  ICU care given
   acute developments.
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute kidney injury (ARF). He underwent cardiac resuscitation and was intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and liver hematoma. He has been experiencing episodes of rigors, diaphoresis, and hypertension, which may be due to bacteremia or pain. The patient's mental status has fluctuated, with periods of agitation and confusion.

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which is likely secondary to multiple factors such as sepsis, hypoxia, and medication effects.
2. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressures, with intermittent episodes of hypotension and hypertension. The cause of these fluctuations is uncertain, with possible contributors including infection, blood transfusion reaction, drug reaction, or other underlying conditions.
3. Fever/Hypotension: The patient has had recurrent fevers and episodes of hypotension, making it difficult to distinguish between sepsis and hypovolemia as the primary cause.
4. Aspiration: The patient aspirated tube feeds during morning rounds, but there was no significant respiratory compromise or infection noted at that time.
5. Liver Hematoma: The patient developed a liver"

   Imaging: [**2107-12-15**]  CXR done
   [**2107-12-14**] CXR  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no
   relevant change. The positions of the tracheostomy tube and the
   bilateral central venous access lines are unchanged. An area of
   plate-like atelectasis emanating from the left hilus is slightly more
   extensive than on the previous examination. In turn, some preexisting
   vascular enlargement in the right lung is slightly less pronounced. The
   size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged. No evidence of newly
   appeared focal parenchymal opacities. Mild overhydration
   could be present.
   [**2107-12-13**] This is an abnormal portable EEG due to multifocal
   synchronous epileptic abnormalities compatible with epileptiform
   discharges in the setting of a severe encephalopathy with multifocal
   structural pathology. Clinical correlation is recommended. The
   background rhythm was slow and disorganized consistent with a moderate
   to severe encephalopathy. Note is also made of suppressive bursts of
   the background rhythm which appear to be more pronounced in the right
   hemisphere suggestive of possible subcortical dysfunction in this area.
   No electrographic seizures were seen during this recording; however,
   given the frequency of epileptic discharges, a repeat study or
   continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for further evaluation.

   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended monitoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC yesterday
   - Monitor coags and Hct q6h, transfuse for Hct > 20; had fairly stable
   hct x 2 days, suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.

   zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C.
   diff negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis.  Last
   elevated Tm 101.9 was on [**2107-12-12**].
   - Peripheral smear, diff ordered
   - Continue empiric vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA

   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.

   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile. Trached.
   - today transitioned from A/C on CPAP [**5-20**]. Will cont to monitor.
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - Pt was NPO while acute GI problems resolve; but will start TFs slowly
   today.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis.  Although pt was put back on CMV/AC; as of
   [**12-15**] he was transitioned to CPAP.
   - ABG on CPAP as above, will cont to monitor.
   - Cont sedation with fentanyl boluses and Seroquel TID.
   .
   # Pain:  Patient clearly in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma. Discontinue Morphine to 4mg
   q2h prn and dc
ed methadone. Discontinue Versed 2-4mg q4h
   - Re-start Seroquel 25mg tid
   - Fentanyl IV
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He is on a heparin drip and being bridged with
   coumadin.  All anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma discovered.
   Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma and risk of
   bleed.
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.
   - Labetalol drip
 turned off overnight
   - Cont hydralazine Q6 hours.
   .
    # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 250 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Patient
   was interactive and following commands [**12-7**], significantly improved
   mental status compared to previous mornings.
   Today, less alert and interactive.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**]
   - extra 250mg IV keppra today
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD MWF
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid.
   - Started Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Other less active/stable issues:
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  Afebrile x 3 days as of [**2107-12-15**].
   - Pt initially required Neo (pressor) to maintain MAP > 60
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Check electrolytes post-dialysis.  Resolved.
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachy and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - ISS
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration pt was kept NPO but
   will re-start tube feeds today ([**12-15**]).
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU care given acute developments.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He underwent cardiac arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter and is now ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure (CRF). He has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including delirium, hypertension, fever (hypothermia), diarrhea, altered mental status (not delirium), respiratory failure (acute), liver hematoma, aspiration, DVT, labile blood pressures, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has been experiencing intermittent hypotension and hypertension, for which he has been receiving labetalol and hydralazine. He is currently hypertensive. He also has a history of fever spikes, hypotension, and suspected infection or blood transfusion reaction. His recent sputum cultures have shown growth of Micrococcus and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, hyponatremia, elevated PTH levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal a liver hematoma, possible aspiration pneumonia, and venous thrombi in several vessels including the inferior vena cava (IVC).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male who has been experiencing multiple complications following a [**Name2 (NI) **] arrest. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, ongoing fevers with elevated white blood cell count, a large hepatic hematoma, altered mental status, hypertension, and diarrhea. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and Bactrim. The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in several parameters such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, glucose, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and others. The patient's vital signs are stable with controlled blood pressure and oxygen saturation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates a severe impairment in oxygen exchange and ventilation. This can lead to further deterioration in the patient's condition if not managed appropriately.

2. Liver Hematoma: The presence of a large hepatic hematoma poses a risk of bleeding and potential complications such as hepatic rupture or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. Infection: The patient's ongoing fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. If not effectively treated, this could lead to sepsis or septic shock.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to various factors including"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Fevers: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T
   on  [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   - Peripheral smear, diff - unremarkable
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u aspergillus study
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.
   - working to wean vent
 pt on CPAP this am ([**5-20**])
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes)
   - will restart tube feeding slowly today
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Titrate down Fentanyl IV slowly, beginning today
   - ABG today
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Slowly titrate down Fentanyl IV given the patient appears comfortable
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See fever section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration
 NPO, but will
   re-start tube feeds slowly today
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic liver failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on ventilatory support. The patient's mental status has improved significantly, and he is now responding to commands. His abdomen is softer, and there is no pedal edema or peripheral vascular issues noted.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 35.0 K/uL and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 390/104). Renal function tests reveal acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 5.7 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 28.3 mg/dL. The patient's electrolyte"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.
   - Sputum [**12-13**] still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of
   Bactrim which finished [**12-14**]
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes), currently
   - Wean vent as below
 pt on CPAP this am
   .
   # Fevers: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T
   on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).  Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation
   of steroids.  Multiple C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.
   Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Given multiple negative C. diff studies,
   d/c Flagyl.  Pt afebrile.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily,
   then d/c
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u aspergillus study
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Titrate down Fentanyl IV slowly, beginning today
   - ABG today
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Continue to hold tube feeds for today
   - NGT to suction
   - 1L D5W vs. NS
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Slowly titrate down Fentanyl IV given the patient appears comfortable
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been

   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See fever section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration
 NPO, but will
   re-start tube feeds slowly today
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic liver disease. He was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory failure, likely due to aspiration pneumonia, and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient also has delirium and altered mental status, possibly secondary to opioid withdrawal or seizures.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating vital signs, including labile blood pressures and tachycardia. He has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and anticonvulsants. The patient has had multiple complications, including abdominal distension, liver hematoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and increased liver enzymes. Imaging studies reveal a dense right middle lobe/retrocardiac opacity, likely representing pneumonia or atelectasis. The patient's renal function is compromised, and he requires dialysis.

The patient's recent events include a PEA arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, aspiration of tube feeds, and fevers. The patient's current medications include hydralazine, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and Keppra.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration events, and there is concern for aspiration pneumonia, which could worsen his respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been febrile on multiple occasions, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Sepsis could lead to further deterioration in his vital signs and organ function.
3. Liver failure: The patient's liver function is compromised, and there is a concern for acute liver failure, which could result in coagulopathy and encephalopathy.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is severely impaired, and he requires dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, potentially leading to complete renal failure.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed DVT, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism and further complications.
6. Thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein: The patient has a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein, which may require intervention to restore proper venous access.

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**].
   - Wean vent as below
 pt on CPAP this am
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA as above
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus study
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for 24 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Continue to hold tube feeds for today
   - KUB today, and if no signs of dilated loops of bowel, consider very
   cautiously re-starting tube feeds
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF). He had a perioperative cardiac arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic liver disease. He underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement and tracheostomy. The patient's clinical course has been complicated by various infections, including pneumonia, central venous line-associated bloodstream infection, and Clostridium difficile colitis. He also experienced a liver hematoma and multiple venous thrombi, including an inferior vena cava thrombosis. The patient's current medications include multiple antibiotics, anticoagulants, and supportive care medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient has been at risk for aspiration due to his altered mental status and tracheostomy. He aspirated tube feeds during morning rounds, but respiratory therapy and nursing suctioned out the aspirate. The patient's chest X-ray did not show clear evidence of pneumonia, but a CT scan showed consolidative opacity in the superior right lower lobe, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam to cover for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged ventilatory support, there is a risk of developing VAP. Surveillance cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be important in preventing and treating this complication.

3. Sepsis: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities, prolonged hospital stay, and various infections, he is at high risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics will be crucial in managing this condition.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his renal function may continue to deteriorate. Close monitoring of renal parameters and frequent dialysis sessions will be necessary to manage his renal failure and associated complications.

5. Liver Hematoma: The patient has a liver hematoma, which could lead to continued bleeding or further complications. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and coagulation parameters will be important, and the hematoma should be re-evaluated for potential embolization or surgical intervention if necessary.

6. Venous Thromboembolism: The patient has multiple venous thrombi, including an inferior vena cava thrombosis. Anticoagulation therapy will be necessary to prevent further clot formation and potential pulmonary embolism. Consideration should also be given to restoring venous patency if indicated.

7. Delirium/Confusion: The patient has had fluctuating levels of consciousness and mental status changes. Delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients, especially those with multiple organ dysfunction. It is important to address potential causes such as infections, sepsis, metabolic disturbances, and withdrawal syndromes."

   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.
   - Sputum [**12-13**] still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of
   Bactrim which finished [**12-14**]
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes), currently
   - Wean vent as below
 pt on CPAP this am
   .
   # Fevers: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T
   on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).  Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation
   of steroids.  Multiple C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.
   Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Given multiple negative C. diff studies,
   d/c Flagyl.  Pt afebrile.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily,
   then d/c
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u aspergillus study
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Titrate down Fentanyl IV slowly, beginning today
   - ABG today
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Continue to hold tube feeds for today
   - NGT to suction
   - 1L D5W vs. NS
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Slowly titrate down Fentanyl IV given the patient appears comfortable
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring
   .
   # Erythematous Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.

   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See fever section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, s/p aspiration
 NPO, but will
   re-start tube feeds slowly today
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic liver disease (CLD). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD).

The patient's recent events include a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement, insertion of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, and placement of a left subclavian line. He has been experiencing fevers, hypotension, and an altered mental status. The patient's abdomen is distended and tympanitic, with a CT scan showing a large liver hematoma and scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma. He has been receiving various medications including vancomycin, zosyn, Bactrim, keppra, fentanyl, and prednisone.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal coagulation profile. His renal function is impaired, and he has hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. The patient's chest X-ray reveals a dense right middle lobe opacity, which may indicate pneumonia or atelectasis. The sputum culture grew St"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.
   - Sputum [**12-13**] still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of
   Bactrim which finished [**12-14**]
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course
   - Wean vent as below
 pt on CPAP this am
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes), currently
   - will restart tube feeding slowly today
   .
   # Fevers: On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60. Question:
   sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus hypotension
   secondary to blood loss.  Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and
   clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that would double-cover with zosyn for
   anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for aspiration is adequate.  C. diff
   negative.  Continued profound increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T
   on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).  Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation
   of steroids.
   - Continue vancomycin and zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures)
   - f/u aspergillus study
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily,
   then d/c
   - Continue Bactrim until [**12-15**] for Stenotrophomonas
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] start empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Given multiple negative C. diff studies,
   d/c Flagyl.
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Titrate down Fentanyl IV slowly, beginning today
   - ABG today
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Slowly titrate down Fentanyl IV given the patient appears comfortable
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   Less active issues
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   .
   # Spiking fevers, hypotension: See fever section above.
   Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with positive sputum
   Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U yesterday, hasn't
   received transfusions before this), possible drug reaction (started
   Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal perforation with
   free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG placed).   Currently
   afebrile.
   .
   Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx about 2
   wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added for
   purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of the
   CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.
   - Continue Bactrim until [**2107-12-15**]
   - Tylenol 650mg PO elixir q6hrs prn
   - [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future (febrile, and it
s an older line)
   and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to talk to IR about pulling the
   PICC, but holding for now given vascular complexity.
   - Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic reaction to blood
   transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still possible?
   - Continue Keppra for possibility of subclinical seizures causing
   fever, MS change --> discuss with Neuro
   - beta-glucan (negative) and galactomannan still pending
   - Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept and
   prednisone)
   - antibiotics and f/u cultures as above

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a complex medical history, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver failure, and acute on chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include a perioperative cardiac arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, aspiration of tube feeds, sepsis with fever and leukocytosis, a liver hematoma, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with venous thrombi in several vessels including the inferior vena cava (IVC). He has also had multiple infections, including pneumonia and a urinary catheter-related bloodstream infection.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status has improved, and he is now responding to commands. However, he remains agitated and uncomfortable, likely due to pain from the hepatic capsule stretch and significant abdominal distension.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on CPAP and the respiratory support is being weaned. The recent chest X-ray shows significant improvement of dense right middle lobe/retrocardiac opacity.
3. Fevers: The patient had intermittent hypotension and hypertension, and the cause of his fevers is unclear. Possible causes include infection, blood transfusion reaction, drug reaction, or abdominal"

   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**].
   - Trach mask today as much as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - send another c.diff
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA as above
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus study)
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask planned for most of today, as toelrated
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Ok to restart tubefeeds but slowly
   - f/u KUB from [**12-16**] final read
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - 3pm Hct today given drop
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   - Discuss with heme-onc on Monday [**12-19**]
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Restarting tubefeeds today.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic liver disease. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently developed multiple complications.

The patient underwent an invasive ventilation procedure, which was stopped on [**2107-12-16**] at 01:52 PM. He then required reintubation and was placed on non-invasive ventilation support. His blood pressure has been labile, requiring frequent adjustments to antihypertensive medications. He also experienced an episode of hypotension, possibly due to blood loss or infection.

The patient has shown signs of confusion and delirium, which have improved with the discontinuation of propofol and midazolam sedation. He has had intermittent fevers, for which various causes have been investigated, including infection, blood transfusion reaction, drug reaction, and sepsis. Cultures have grown Gram-negative rods and coag-positive Staphylococcus, but specific pathogens have not been identified. The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and Bactrim.

Abdominal distension persists, likely due to chemical peritonitis or functional ileus. A CT scan showed a large liver hematoma without active extravasation. The patient received 2 units of packed red"

 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**].
   - Wean vent as below
 pt on CPAP this am
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus

   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Patient on CPAP, RSBI in the 50
s this morning, will attempt to
   convert to trach mask today
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for 24 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Continue to hold tube feeds for today
   - KUB today, and if no signs of dilated loops of bowel, consider very
   cautiously re-starting tube feeds
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Had u/s that did not completely visualize subclavian
   vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had PICC placed
   yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein with
   +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.

   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic liver failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter. The patient has been ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient exhibits altered mental status and agitation. He has intact brainstem reflexes but may have difficulty assessing his cortex. The MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - Follow up neuro recommendations; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24-hour video EEG monitoring. Will follow up on results.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated due to possible hypoxia beforehand. There are concerns about pneumonia (PNA) based on CT chest findings and atelectasis on chest X-rays. Current sputum cultures show gram-negative rods and coag-positive Staphylococcus.
   - Convert to trach mask today.
   - Pt on CPAP, RSBI in the 50s this morning.

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with multiple problems following a cardiac arrest, including respiratory failure, ongoing fevers with elevated white blood cell count, and a large hepatic hematoma. The patient remains clinically improved with a non-tender abdomen. He has delirium/confusion, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hepatic hematoma/blood loss anemia, hypertension, altered mental status, hypotension, fevers and elevated WBC, thromboses, chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and other issues managed by the ICU team.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers and elevated WBC count, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or another source.
3. Hepatic hematoma: The patient has a large hepatic hematoma, which poses a risk of bleeding and potential rupture.
4. Thromboses: The patient is at risk for thromboses due to immobilization and underlying conditions.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient requires hemodialysis, indicating chronic renal failure, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
6. Delirium/confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium/confusion, which can increase the risk of falls, self-removal of lines/tubes"

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**] -> will d/c today
   - Trach mask today as much as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - send another c.diff
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA as above
 can
   d/c today [**12-18**]
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus study)
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask planned for most of today, as tolerated
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for >48 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - start Atenolol 25mg Qday
   - Plan to dc hydralazine/labetolol ASAP
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Ok to restart tubefeeds but slowly
   - Will start Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed
   diabetic gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - daily HCT
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Restarting tubefeeds today.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU care continues given acuity of illness; discuss rehab
   placement with case management
","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter.
- The patient has been ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and coronary artery disease (CAD).
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 157/63 mmHg to 213/140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals erythematous eyes, rales in the lungs, distended and tense abdomen, and pedal edema.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, liver enzymes, and lactate levels.
- Imaging studies reveal a large liver hematoma with perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the mesentery.
- The patient has been diagnosed with delirium, respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, liver hematoma, injected and irritated eyes, pain, acute on chronic renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, and transient ST elevations on EKG.
- The patient's medical complications include hypotension, hypertension, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, right upper extremity swelling, and diabetic mellitus type II.
- The patient's ongoing management includes ongoing respiratory support, hemodialysis, antibiotic therapy, pain management, and anticoagulation therapy.
- The patient's family has been informed about the code status and discussed potential rehabilitation placement.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has been at risk for aspiration due to altered mental status and the use of a tracheostomy tube. This can lead to lung infection and worsening respiratory status.
2. Liver hematoma complications: The patient has a large liver hematoma, which can potentially lead to bleeding or further liver damage.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of venous thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC). If left untreated, this can lead to pulmonary embolism.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
5. Infection: The patient has been febrile at times, and there is a risk of developing sepsis or other infections.
6. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has had labile blood pressures, with episodes of hypotension and hypertension. This can lead to organ damage if not managed appropriately.
7. Delirium: The patient continues to have altered mental status, which can increase the risk of falls, self-extubation, and other complications associated with delirium."

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**].
   - Trach mask today as much as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - send another c.diff
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA as above
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus study)
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask planned for most of today, as toelrated
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, but
   continued tense, distended, tympanitic abdomen.
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Ok to restart tubefeeds but slowly
   - f/u KUB from [**12-16**] final read
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - 3pm Hct today given drop
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   - Discuss with heme-onc on Monday [**12-19**]
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Restarting tubefeeds today.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.
   Code:  Full (discussed with family)
   Communication: with wife [**Name (NI) 470**] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 10045**].
   Disposition: ICU care continues given acuity of illness.
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), who presented with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure. He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) due to a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic liver disease.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) mode, with improved mental status and respiratory effort. Tracheostomy tube in place.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: Blood pressure fluctuations, with recent hypertension. Labetalol has been initiated for blood pressure control.
- Fluid balance: Positive fluid balance due to ongoing diuresis.
- Temperature: Mild fever.
- Mental status: Agitated, disoriented, and not following commands. Previously, the patient had intact cognition and was conversant.
- Abdominal distension: Persistent and tympanitic abdomen, suggestive of chemical peritonitis. CT abdomen shows large liver hematoma and perihepatic hematoma.
- Liver function: Abnormal liver enzymes and coagulation profile, indicative of liver dysfunction.
- Renal function: Acute on chronic renal failure, with elevated creatinine and urea levels.
- Hematology: Elevated white blood cell count and platelet count.
- Coagulation: Abnormal coagulation profile, likely due to liver dysfunction.
- Neurology: Seizure-like activity detected on continuous EEG monitoring, for which Keppra has been started.
- Ophthalmology: Irritated eyes, for which eye drops have been recommended.
- Pain: Patient appears uncomfortable and in pain, likely due to stretch of the hepatic capsule and significant abdominal distension.
- Infection: Sputum cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods and coag-positive Staphylococcus. Aspiration event occurred, but no clear evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray.
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Venous thrombi present in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC).
- Anemia: Chronic and stable, possibly related to renal disease or anemia of chronic disease.
- Hypercalcemia: Elevated serum calcium level, likely secondary or tertiary due to renal failure.
- Right upper extremity swelling: Resolved, with a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic vein detected during placement of the subclavian line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with ongoing need for mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Infection: The patient has shown signs of infection, with positive sputum cultures and fever. There is a risk of further infection, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infection.
3. Liver hematoma: The patient has a large liver hematoma, which could lead to hemorrhagic complications if it ruptures.
4. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with acute on chronic renal failure. There is a risk of worsening renal failure and the need for dialysis.
5. DVT: The presence of venous thrombi in multiple vessels increases the risk of pulmonary embolism (PE).
6. Hypercalcemia: Elevated serum calcium levels can lead to complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen if not appropriately managed, leading to fatigue, decreased oxygen carrying capacity, and other complications.
8. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity indicate a risk of ongoing neurological complications, including encephalopathy and further seizures.

Further evaluation and management are needed to address these potential complications and optimize the patient's care."

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask today as much as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - send another c.diff
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus studies)
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask planned for most of today, as tolerated
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours (wean this down once lisinopril starts
   acting)
   - Start lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - Increase atenolol to 50mg daily
   - Labetalol as a prn if SBP >160
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - daily HCT
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.

   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, encourage PO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Hold tubefeeds. Speech & swallow consult.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place. Keep lines for now status
   quo.

   Assessment and Plan
 DELIRIUM / CONFUSION
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn to cover for aspiration (anaerobes) for a 7 day
   course, currently day 5 on [**12-16**], d/c on [**12-18**] -> will d/c today
   - Trach mask today as much as tolerated
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - send another c.diff
   - Continue vancomycin/zosyn for presumed aspiration PNA as above
 can
   d/c today [**12-18**]
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   - f/u cultures (blood and sputum cultures, aspergillus study)
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask planned for most of today, as tolerated
   - Pt has not received Fentanyl IV for >48 hours, will keep as prn but
   minimize use
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue Hydralazine Q6 hours; once BP stabilizes, consider
   transitioning to BP medication such as CCB or BB (hold off on ACE/[**Last Name (un) 239**]
   given acute on chronic renal failure) without the risk of rebound
   hypertension, given the patient
s history of labile BPs.
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   - start Atenolol 25mg Qday
   - Plan to dc hydralazine/labetolol ASAP
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Ok to restart tubefeeds but slowly
   - Will start Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed
   diabetic gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - daily HCT
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.  Will follow up on results.
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Patient appears in pain and uncomfortable, likely due to
   stretch of hepatic capsule due to hematoma and significant abdominal
   distension.  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed.  Initiated
   on Fentanyl IV.
   - Pt has not been receiving Fentanyl IV for >24 hours, and will
   minimize use for patient comfort
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, next HD [**2107-12-16**] (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 30.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi but will hold off on this discussion until
   next week, after the patient has been stable for another several days
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Restarting tubefeeds today.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic hemodialysis (HD). He was admitted with dyspnea and acute respiratory failure (ARF), which progressed to ventilator dependency due to mental status changes. The patient also had aspiration during morning rounds and developed delirium/confusion. Other issues include injectable irritated eyes, pain, acute on chronic renal failure, hepatic hematoma, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, transient ST elevations on EKG, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and right upper extremity (RUE) swelling. The patient's current condition is critical, and he is being managed in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation was ARF, which has now progressed to ventilator dependency. There is a risk of further respiratory complications, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy site infection.

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had emesis during rounds and aspirated tube feeds. This increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia, which can lead to lung infection and sepsis.

3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's mental status changes and delirium require close monitoring. There is a risk of worsening delirium or development of other psychiatric complications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 62-year-old man with multiple medical problems post [**Name2 (NI) **] arrest, including respiratory failure, ongoing fevers/WBC, and large hepatic hematoma.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation.
- He has been diagnosed with delirium/confusion, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypertension, hepatic hematoma/blood loss anemia, altered mental status, and hypothyroidism.
- The patient has been started on antibiotics (Bactrim) and probiotics (Flagyl) due to fevers and elevated white blood cell count.
- Heparin has been held in the setting of liver hematoma, and the decision to restart anticoagulation will be made by hematology.
- The patient is on hemodialysis for chronic renal failure.
- Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.
- The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. If not properly managed, it could lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hepatic Hematoma: The presence of a large hepatic hematoma poses a risk of internal bleeding and potential hemorrhagic shock. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent complications.
3. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's delirium/conf"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Decrease Hydralazine dose Q6 hours
   - Increase atenolol to 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Labetalol as a prn if SBP >160
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, encourage PO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Hold tubefeeds. Speech & swallow consult.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place. Keep lines for now status
   quo.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter and is now ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

The patient has a history of chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and chronic renal failure. He is currently on hemodialysis three times a week and has been on various antibiotics for suspected infections. The patient's recent course has been complicated by multiple issues, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, liver hematoma, DVT, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and unresponsiveness. Seizure activity has been observed, but continuous EEG monitoring did not show any overt seizure activity. The patient is currently on keppra for seizure prophylaxis.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to hypoxia during CPR. He has had episodes of respiratory acidosis and has been on CPAP and tracheostomy. The patient's sputum cultures have revealed gram-negative rods and coag-positive staphylococcus. Further investigation is needed to determine if he has pneumonia or atelectasis.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.  D1 = [**12-15**], d/c [**12-29**] after 14 day course.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Discontinue Hydralazine
   - Continue atenolol at 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Discontinue Labetalol prn as BP has not been above >160
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma and
   renal failure
   - Prednisone 40mg daily x5 days, as patient should not receive
   colchicine given his renal failure
   - Tylenol for pain, as pt should not receive NSAIDS due to his renal
   failure
   - I/O check to ensure net even
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, encourage PO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Hold tubefeeds. Speech & swallow consult.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place. Keep lines for now status
   quo.

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p [**Doctor Last Name **] arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.  D1 = [**12-15**], d/c [**12-29**] after 14 day course.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Discontinue Hydralazine
   - Continue atenolol at 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Discontinue Labetalol prn as BP has not been above >160
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Foot Pain:  Likely gout
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p [**Month/Year (2) **] arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, encourage PO, PMV use as tolerated.
   Hold tubefeeds. Speech & swallow consult.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place. Keep lines for now status
   quo.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute kidney injury (AKI). He has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient experienced an arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter and required mechanical ventilation. He is currently ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, suspected aspiration pneumonia, infection with Micrococcus and Stenotrophomonas, liver hematoma, abdominal distension, labile blood pressure, foot pain, altered mental status, injected and irritated eyes, pain, acute on chronic renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, transient ST elevations on EKG, hyperparathyroidism, right upper extremity swelling, and type II diabetes mellitus.

The patient is on various medications including antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn, Bactrim, Flagyl), anticoagulants (heparin, coumadin), anti-seizure medication (Keppra), and pain control medications.

Plan:
1. Video swallow to assess swallowing function and determine the safest and least restrictive oral diet.
2. Initiate oral intake of nectar thick liquids and soft solids with postural changes (PMV) for all oral intake.
3. Crush pills with puree.
4. Provide 1"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with multiple problems following a [Name2 (NI)] arrest, including respiratory failure, ongoing fevers with an elevated white blood cell count, and a large hepatic hematoma. The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Hepatic Hematoma/Blood Loss Anemia: The patient has a large hepatic hematoma, which can lead to ongoing internal bleeding and subsequent anemia. Monitoring the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels will be crucial to assess the severity of blood loss.

2. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which ACE inhibitors may be prescribed to help control blood pressure.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, not associated with ARDS. Treatment includes maintaining the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters through therapies such as positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and mechanical ventilation.

4. Fevers and Elevated WBC: The patient has ongoing low-grade temperatures and an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection. Antibiotics have been administered, and further evaluation may be necessary to identify the source of infection.

5. Thromboses: The patient's thrombosis status is mentioned, but details are not provided. This suggests that there may be concerns about blood clots, and a consultation with hematology has been arranged.

   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask cont.
   -speech & swallow recs to be instituted to avoid further aspiration
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.  D1 = [**12-15**], d/c [**12-29**] after 14 day course.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Continue atenolol at 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Continue home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma and
   renal failure. Mild improvement today.
   - Prednisone 40mg daily x5 days ([**Date range (1) 11152**]), as patient should not
   receive colchicine given his renal failure
   - Tylenol for pain, as pt should not receive NSAIDS due to his renal
   failure
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]). Ok to take
   PO now, per speech & swallow. Without abdominal pain today.
   - Diet per speech & swallow; hold tubefeeds.
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR. Abdominal pain
   improved.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP. Trach mask, tolerating well.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - PO prednisone
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic

","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient has undergone several procedures, including placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter, tracheostomy (trach), and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient has intact brainstem reflexes but difficulty assessing his cortex. His MRI did not show any signs of acute ischemia. The patient has been agitated when sedation is weaned and has had a staring spell that was concerning for seizures. He is currently on continuous EEG monitoring.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to arrest with possible hypoxia beforehand. There has been some question of pneumonia on CT chest, and the patient has had CXRs with left lower lobe atelectasis vs. infiltrate. A bronchoscopic evaluation was unrevealing, but recent cultures grew Gram-negative rods and coag-positive Staphylococcus. The patient is now on tracheostomy ventilation and tolerating it well.

3. Fevers: The patient has had multiple fevers, initially thought to be due to"

   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status
 now trach
d and prepared to
   go to rehab.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask cont.
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.  D1 = [**12-15**], d/c [**12-29**] after 14 day course.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Discontinue Hydralazine
   - Continue atenolol at 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Discontinue Labetalol prn as BP has not been above >160
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma and
   renal failure
   - Prednisone 40mg daily x5 days ([**Date range (1) 11152**]), as patient should not
   receive colchicine given his renal failure
   - Tylenol for pain, as pt should not receive NSAIDS due to his renal
   failure
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read

   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho

   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs

   Less active issues:

   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.

   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and chronic renal failure. He was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF) and subsequently developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient also experienced a perioperative cardiac arrest during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter and was found to have multiple thrombi in several vessels, including the inferior vena cava (IVC).

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, aspiration, fever, leukocytosis, liver hematoma, hypotension, hypertension, gout flare, abdominal distension, and anemia. He has been treated with various medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, steroids, and renal replacement therapy.

The patient's medical complications include respiratory failure, sepsis, liver hematoma, acute on chronic renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and possible drug reactions. He has been on renal replacement therapy and has had multiple central lines placed due to his condition.

Further management of the patient should include close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory status, and renal function. The patient's altered mental status requires ongoing assessment and management, including consideration of delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy. The liver hematoma should be monitored, and anti-coagulation may need to be restarted based on the results of the h"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   61M with ESRD s/p CRT, HTN, DM, admitted with dyspnea and ARF and now
   s/p PEA arrest during IR placement of temporary HD catheter, now
   ventilator-dependent due to mental status
 now trach
d and prepared to
   go to rehab.
   .
   # Aspiration:  Patient had emesis during morning rounds, aspirated tube
   feeds but respiratory therapist and nurse suctioned out aspirate.
   Currently not hypoxic and afebrile.  Risk for aspiration pneumonitis
   vs. aspiration PNA.  Hold on CXR until patient clinically shows signs
   of infection, as this would not change management currently.  Also hold
   antibiotics for now until patient shows evidence of aspiration
   pneumonia, but if signs of infection, consider Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl.
   Patient on Vanc/Zosyn.  CXR shows no clear evidence of PNA but CT [**12-11**]
   showed confluent consolidative opacity of superior RLL, atelectasis vs.
   aspirationi or pneumonia.  Pt was febrile following aspiration event
   but is now afebrile on Vanc/Zosyn x 3 days.  However, sputum from [**12-13**]
   still growing Stenotrophomonas despite a course of Bactrim which
   finished [**12-15**]. s/p 7-day course of vanc/zosyn for aspiration that
   ended on [**12-18**].
   - Re-start Bactrim x14 day course, day 1=[**12-16**] to d/c [**12-30**]; appears
   Bactrim may not have been given at the correct times after HD and may
   have been dialyzed off in the past
   - Trach mask cont.
   .
   # Fevers: Infection (recent sputum with Micrococcus and now with
   positive sputum Cx's as well) vs blood transfusion reaction (got 1U
   yesterday, hasn't received transfusions before this), possible drug
   reaction (started Keppra recently) vs TTP (less likely) vs abdominal
   perforation with free air under diaphragm (although just had PEG
   placed).  Of note: has had a long course of Cefepime for a positive UCx
   about 2 wks ago with Pseudomonas and most recently Linezolid was added
   for purulent appearing CVL
s bilaterally that have been removed. One of
   the CVL
s grew out Micrococcus and according to ID, the Cefepime should
   have covered it. He received a 14d course of Cefepime and 9d course of
   Linezolid.   Sputum from [**12-2**] showed coag positive Staph aureus and
   Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, both sparse growth, the latter of which
   is sensitive to Bactrim.  Fever curve down-trending on Bactrim, d/c
   Vanc/Zosyn.  Previously d/c
ed cipro and linezolid and flagyl. Now has
   gram (-) rods in sputum as well.  [**Month (only) 60**] need to pull PICC in the future
   (febrile, and it
s an older line) and replace with new CVL. [**Month (only) 60**] need to
   talk to IR about pulling the PICC, but holding for now given vascular
   complexity.  Normal haptoglobin reduces likelihood of hemolytic
   reaction to blood transfusion, but febrile transfusion rxn still
   possible?  Received inhaled pentamidine for prophylaxis (given cellcept
   and prednisone).  On neo since early this morning, goal MAP >60.
   Question: sepsis as etiology with fever and leukocytosis, versus
   hypotension secondary to blood loss.
   .
   Sputum shows GNR and GPC in pairs and clusters.  d/c
ed flagyl as that
   would double-cover with zosyn for anaerobes, and zosyn coverage for
   aspiration is adequate.  C. diff negative.  Continued profound
   increasing leukocytosis. Last elevated T on [**2107-12-12**] (101.9).
   Leukocytosis resolved following discontinuation of steroids.  Multiple
   C. diff toxins negative, will d/c Flagyl.  Afebrile.
   - Given elevated WBC count and long term abxs, have started empiric
   coverage for C. diff colitis.  Will also send C. diff toxin x 3 and
   will stop tx if all negative.  Despite multiple negative C. diff
   studies, will continue Flagyl as patient is clinically improving on his
   current antibiotic regimen and Flagyl may be treating an occult
   infection.  D1 = [**12-15**], d/c [**12-29**] after 14 day course.
   - Continue Bactrim as above for Stenotrophomonas
   .
   # Labile blood pressures: Pt has been intermittently hypotensive
   (infectious source vs hypovolemia?) and hypertensive, for which he was
   getting Labetalol. He is now more persistently hypertensive, up to
   190
s/100
s.  Was transitioned from Labetalol drip to po Labetalol
   [**12-9**], then switched to Labetalol prn given fluctuating pressures.  On
   [**12-14**], Labetalol was d/c
ed and Hydralazine standing was started.
   - Discontinue Hydralazine
   - Continue atenolol at 50mg daily
   - Continue lisinopril 10mg daily
   - Discontinue Labetalol prn as BP has not been above >160
   - Changed Hydrocort stress dose steroids to home Prednisone 5mg daily
   .
   # Foot Pain:  Likely gout, particularly given resolving hematoma and
   renal failure
   - Prednisone 40mg daily x5 days ([**Date range (1) 11152**]), as patient should not
   receive colchicine given his renal failure
   - Tylenol for pain, as pt should not receive NSAIDS due to his renal
   failure
   .
   # Abdominal Distension:  Patient
s abdomen continues to be distended
   and tympanitic, recent CT abdomen [**12-11**] showed large liver hematoma with
   scattered areas of perihepatic hematoma and scattered blood within the
   mesentery but without definite sites of active extravasation.
   Distension likely [**2-7**] chemical peritonitis which is resolving following
   reversal of anticoagulation vs. functional ileus/[**Last Name (un) **]
s syndrome
   from infection/sepsis, intra-abdominal bleed, narcotic use, or
   respiratory failure.  This is consistent with the patient
s continued
   +bowel sounds and leukocytosis, but CT abdomen did not show dilated R
   side of colon and loops of bowel were read to be wnl.  Currently
   improved abdominal pain and minimally improved distension, and abd much
   less tense than prior.  However, pt has had nausea with tube feeds and
   was only able to tolerate 2 hours of TF yesterday ([**12-17**]).
   - Monitor and manage conservatively for now, given patient
s underlying
   conditions are slowly resolving and he is clinically improving
   - Encourage PO intake today
   - Continue Reglan 2.5mg TID standing for treatment of presumed diabetic
   gastroparesis
   .
   # Liver Hematoma:  DIC and hemolysis labs negative, consider bleed.  CT
   showed hematoma of liver, difficulty reversing bleed.  s/p 2 units
   PRBC.  IR consulted re: possible embolization, did not feel the bleed
   was acute (felt >48 hours old) and wished to preserve hepatic artery
   and liver function if possible, so recommended monitoring Hct.  General
   surgery consulted re: possible relation to PEG placement, but did not
   believe this was [**2-7**] procedure based on the location of the hematoma.
   Recommended montoring q6h Hct and coags, transfusing as needed and
   keeping Hct >20.  Received 1 unit PRBC but has had stable Hct since,
   suggesting resolution of bleed with reversal of PTT/INR.
   - f/u Heme/Onc consult today for anti-coagulation for multiple thrombi
   in setting of recent liver hematoma
   - Monitor coags and Hct daily, goal Hct >28
   - Active T&S
   .
   Less Active Issues:
   .
   # Respiratory failure. Originally intubated in setting of arrest with
   possible hypoxia beforehand.  Some question of PNA on CT chest and has
   had CXR's with LLL atelectasis vs infiltrate, unclear whether he truly
   has PNA or not.  Had bronch that was unrevealing, Cx
s now reveal GNR
   and coag (+) staph.  Trach and PEG placed on [**12-2**].  Now off sedation,
   d/c
ed Seroquel, Propofol, Midazolam sedation.  On trach mask most of
   day with some resp acidosis. As of today ([**12-15**]), transitioned from AC
   to CPAP.
   - Trach mask today
   .
   # Altered mental status s/p PEA arrest:  Patient has intact brainstem
   reflexes but it is difficult to assess his cortex.  His MRI, though
   severely limited by motion artifact, did not show any signs of acute
   ischemia.  Weaning of sedation has consistently shown agitation. He was
   making some strides towards improvement last week, with following
   commands and responding to the environment, but most recently he has
   just been thrashing around and very agitated when sedation is weaned,
   not following commands, not tracking across the room, not making
   progress.  Changed from Propofol to versed because of triglycerides of
   700. Most recently, Neuro has noted a staring spell that was concerning
   for continued seizures, so he was on continuous EEG for a while, with
   epileptiform spikes but not outright seizure activity. They recommended
   a Keppra load, with Keppra 500 qday and an extra 250 after HD.  Today,
   the patient is not alert or interactive.  Neurology recommended 24 hour
   EEG monitoring, which was performed [**12-15**] with results pending.  On
   [**12-14**], the patient became significantly less agitated and was responsive
   and conversant, obeying commands and expressing intact cognition.
   Likely causes are delirium [**2-7**] medical condition and opioid withdrawal,
   and possible seizure and encephalopathy from acute liver failure or
   methadone use in the setting of liver failure.
   - Continue Keppra 500mg IV q12h; extra 250mg IV keppra with HD.
   - f/u neuro recs; Neuro re-consulted [**12-15**], completed 24 hour video EEG
   monitoring.
   - f/u EEG read
   .
   # Injected, Irritated Eyes:  Ophtho consulted, recommended eye drops.
   Improving.
   - Continue eye drops per Ophtho
   .
   # Pain:  Discontinued Morphine, Methadone, and Versed and Fentanyl.
   - Pain controlled
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure.  He is s/p CRT in [**2101**].  Etiology of
   ARF unclear thus far, but per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 699**] it is unlikely that he will
   regain enough renal function to be free of dialysis.  Had started back
   on CVVH after getting R groin HD line, but most recently this has not
   been functioning well, IR has tried to replace it, and had been
   unsuccessful. So, they placed a L subclavian line which has been
   working successfully.
   - f/u renal recs
   - HD per renal, HD today (MWF)
   - Continue home does of prednisone; may need stress dose prednisone if
   HD unstable. Change PO to IV steroids given NPO s/p aspiration.
   - On Renagel 800 tid, Sevelemer 800 tid.
   .
   # DVT: Patient found to have venous thrombi in several vessels
   including his IVC.  He was on a heparin drip, being bridged with
   coumadin.  However, all anticoagulation stopped when liver hematoma
   discovered.  Daily INR, no anticoagulation for now given liver hematoma
   and risk of bleed.
   - Will need to re-address the issue of anti-coagulation for the
   patient
s multiple thrombi
   - consult heme-onc today for anti-coag recs
   .
   Less active issues:
   .
   # Anemia.  See Hct section above.
   Previously, chronic and stable.  ?ACD (c/w recent Fe studies) vs.
   related to renal disease. B12 and Folate normal.  Doesn't appear to be
   DIC, or hemolysis.
   - EPO at HD
   .
   # ST elevations transiently seen on EKG: Transient, resolved; in
   setting of tachycardia and hypertensive.
   .
   # Endo: Elevated PTH is likely secondary or tertiary and due to renal
   failure. Has been hypercalcemic and hyperphosphatemic. Per renal recs,
   have increased AlOH to 45 tid.
   .
   # RUE swelling: Resolved. Had u/s that did not completely visualize
   subclavian vein, but was thought  that DVT was unlikely. When pt had
   PICC placed yesterday found a thrombosed/stenosed brachial-cephalic
   vein with +collaterals--needs plasty prior to Picc removal if afebrile.
   .
   # DM type II. Due to hypoglycemia surrounding cooling was taken off of
   long-acting insulin.  Glucose control suboptimal now w/ sliding scale
   only.
   - [**Hospital1 **] insulin
   .
   FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, encourage PO with speech & swallow
   restrictions, PMV use as tolerated. Hold tubefeeds.
   Prophylaxis:  sucralfate (per ID), pneumoboots
   Access: R PICC placed [**11-23**] now working, may need to be pulled due to
   fevers, and if so, will need to have new central line placed. L
   subclavian HD line placed [**11-30**], would be very hesitant to pull this
   line given how difficult it was to place. Keep lines for now status
   quo.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted with dyspnea and acute renal failure (ARF). He has a history of chronic renal failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The patient underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during the placement of a temporary hemodialysis (HD) catheter and was subsequently ventilator-dependent due to mental status changes.

The patient has been experiencing various complications, including aspiration pneumonia, sepsis, multi-drug resistant infections, liver hematoma, DVT, and anemia. He has undergone multiple interventions, such as tracheostomy, percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG), and placement of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressures, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Aspiration: The patient had emesis during morning rounds and aspirated tube feeds. There is a risk for aspiration pneumonitis versus aspiration pneumonia. It is recommended to hold chest X-ray until the patient shows signs of infection, as this would not change management currently. Antibiotics will be held for now until the patient shows evidence of aspiration pneumonia, but if signs of infection are present, consider vancomycin, cefepime, and Flagyl.
2. Fevers: The patient's fever could be due to infection, blood"
