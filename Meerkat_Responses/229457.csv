   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old male with HTN, HLD who was transferred from an outside
   hospital for STEMI after 4 days of constant chest pain, now s/p PCI
   with DES x2 in LAD.
   # CAD, s/p STEMI:
   s/p PCI w DESx2 to mid LAD and mid distal LAD. Patient had 4 days of
   constant chest pain with peak CK [**2093**] and Trop-I of 74. Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG shows persistent ST elevations in leads V2-V5 after
   intervention, may have aneurysm, risk of free wall rupture/VSD.
   - integrilin drip x18hrs
 finishes this AM at 10am
   - aspirin, prasugrel
   - cont low dose metoprolol
   - start high dose statin
   - wean off IV nitro
   - morphine for pain control
   - TTE this AM
   - if TTE shows apical hypokinesis or aneurysm, as expected, will start
   heparin drip or lovenox for prevention of LV thrombus
   - will need coumadin chronically for aneurysm
   - Physical therapy
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Received small dye load during Cardiac Cath yesterday. Does not appear
   dry on exam.
   - urine electrolytes
   # Acute Fluid overload
   Likely secondary to stunned myocardium post MI and decreased EF.
   Patient not on diuretics at home aside from Triamterene/HCTZ for BP
   control.
   - monitor for now
   .
   # Hypertension
   SBPs 100-110s on nitro drip overnight.
   - Will wean nitro drip as tolerated for pain control and restart home

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia (HLD). He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The patient presented with intermittent chest pain episodes, which were relieved by morphine and an increased nitroglycerin drip. He also experienced another episode of chest pain overnight, similar in quality to his previous myocardial infarction pain, radiating to both arms and the left jaw.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate (HR) of 61 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 101/61 mmHg to 132/73 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96% on nasal cannula, and sinus rhythm (SR) heart rhythm.

The patient's physical examination revealed well-nourished male in no acute distress, oriented x3 with appropriate mood and affect. There were no chest wall deformities, and the patient had diffuse crackles at the lung bases bilaterally. The abdomen was soft, obese, mildly distended, and mildly tender.

   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old male with HTN, HLD who was transferred from an outside
   hospital for STEMI after 4 days of constant chest pain, now s/p PCI
   with DES x2 in LAD.
   # CAD, s/p STEMI:
   s/p PCI w DESx2 to mid LAD and mid distal LAD. Patient had 4 days of
   constant chest pain with peak CK [**2093**] and Trop-I of 74. Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG shows persistent ST elevations in leads V2-V5 after
   intervention, may have aneurysm, risk of free wall rupture/VSD.
   Integrilin drip finished yesterday morning 10am.  Weaned off nitro
   yesterday.  Complained of chest pain w physical therapy yesterday.
   Persistent ST changes on EKG suggest aneurysm.
   - continue aspirin, prasugrel
   - cont low dose metoprolol
   - start high dose statin
   - morphine for pain control
   - started on heparin drip for prevention of LV thrombus
   - cont coumadin chronically for aneurysm
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Received small dye load (130cc) during Cardiac Cath two days ago.
   Urine electrolytes show FeNa 0.08%, and hyaline casts in UA also
   suggest intravascular volume depletion; FeNa could also suggest
   contrast-induced nephropathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) and hyperlipidemia (HLD). He was transferred from an outside hospital for a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after experiencing constant chest pain for 4 days. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions. These include acute renal failure, likely secondary to contrast-induced nephropathy due to the dye load during cardiac catheterization and intravascular volume depletion; acute systolic congestive heart failure, evidenced by mildly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), persistent crackles/rales in the lungs, and response to intravenous (IV) furosemide (Lasix); fever, possibly related to the ongoing myocardial infarction; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); hypertension; and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including aspirin, prasugrel, low-dose metoprolol, high-dose statin, morphine for pain control, heparin drip for prevention of left ventricular thrombus, and chronic coumadin therapy for aneurysm prevention.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia who was admitted to the ICU for a STEMI after experiencing constant chest pain for four days. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently chest pain-free but has persistent ST elevations in leads V2-V5 on EKG, which may suggest an aneurysm. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/68 mmHg to 149/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. 

Physical examination findings include diffuse crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, trace bilateral lower extremity edema, and a mildly distended abdomen. 

Laboratory results show elevated troponin-T levels, mildly elevated creatinine levels, and slightly abnormal white blood cell count. 

Imaging studies reveal moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis to akinesis in the mid to distal septal, anterior, antero-lateral, and apical regions. There is also a mildly dilated left atrium, normal right ventricular chamber size, and borderline normal free wall function.

   disease. The LAD had a total occlusion mid-vessel.
   ECHO:
   EF 30%
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal, anterior,
   antero-lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis. No masses or thrombi
   are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
   wall function. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure
   is normal. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old male with HTN, HLD who was transferred from an outside
   hospital for STEMI after 4 days of constant chest pain, now s/p PCI
   with DES x2 in LAD.
   # CAD, s/p STEMI:
   s/p PCI w DESx2 to mid LAD and mid distal LAD. Patient had 4 days of
   constant chest pain with peak CK [**2093**] and Trop-I of 74. Currently chest
   pain free.  EKG shows persistent ST elevations in leads V2-V5 after
   intervention, may have aneurysm, risk of free wall rupture/VSD.
   Integrilin drip finished yesterday morning 10am.  Weaned off nitro
   yesterday.  Complained of chest pain w physical therapy yesterday.
   Persistent ST changes on EKG suggest aneurysm.
   - continue aspirin, prasugrel
   - cont low dose metoprolol
   - start high dose statin
   - morphine for pain control
   - started on heparin drip for prevention of LV thrombus
   - will need coumadin chronically for aneurysm
   # Acute Renal Failure
   Received small dye load (130cc) during Cardiac Cath two days ago.
   Urine electrolytes show FeNa 0.08%, and hyaline casts in UA also
   suggest intravascular volume depletion; FeNa could also suggest
   contrast-induced nephropathy.
   - encourage po intake
   # Hypertension
   - restart home triamterene/HCTZ
   - can uptitrate beta blocker as well as tolerated by BP
   # BPH
   - continue home flomax and cardura

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who presented to the hospital with a STEMI after 4 days of constant chest pain. He underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents placed in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing chest pain while on physical therapy. His ejection fraction is 30%, indicating moderate to severe regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The patient also has single vessel disease with minimal disease in the left main coronary artery (LMCA), left circumflex artery (LCx), and right coronary artery (RCA), but a total occlusion in the mid-vessel of the LAD. He has persistent ST elevations on EKG, which may suggest aneurysm formation. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Aneurysm: The persistent ST changes on EKG suggest the possibility of aneurysm formation, which can be a complication of myocardial infarction.
2. Free wall rupture/Ventricular septal defect (VSD): The persistent ST changes on EKG also indicate a risk of free wall rupture or VSD.
3. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient received a small dye load during cardiac catheterization two days ago, and urine electrolytes show a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 0.08%,"
