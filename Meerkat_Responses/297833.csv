   Assessment and Plan
   57 year-old female with history of HTN, DM, cirrhosis alcohol
   abuse/dependence who is transfered to MICU for restlessness and concern
   of alcohol withdrawl.
   # Restlessness, mental status change, recnet alcohol use: The clinical
   presentation most likely represents alcohol withdrawl. Last drink
   approximately 3 days ago, in the setting of long term alcohol use
   (yrs). Alternative etiologies include hepatic encephalopathy. Infection
   appears less likely in the absence of fever, leukocytosis. .
   - CIWA scale: will use ativan 0.5-1 mg q1hr since this appears
   effective in controlling her symptoms. Also given the concurrent
   seizures and hepatic disease this is prefered to valium. If she doesnt
   respond and requires higher doses will use valium.
   - lactulose and rifaximin
   - head CT to eval any recent changes
   - Urine and blood cultures
   # Seizure: Likely alcohol withdrawl seizure. Recent cipro may have
   contributed to this. Pt mildly hyponatremic but this is unlikely to
   have contributed to the seizure. Alternative etiologies such as
   metabolic abnormalities, intracranial processes and infection are less
   likely given normal CMP, negative CT head from two days ago and absence
   of signs of infection. Seizure stopped with ativan.
   - Continue ativan as indicated by Neuro (i.e TID)
   - EEG/head CT
   # Hypovolemic hyponatremia: likely volume depletion based on exam.
   - NS and monitor
   # Tachycardia: EtOH withdrawl vs volume depletion vs pain vs infection.
   Improved with IVF bolus and ativan.
   - monitor
   # Hypertension: EtOH withdrawl vs essential. Improved with ativan.
   - monitor
   .
   # Cirrhosis:  Alcoholic in nature, although possible immune process as
   well given positive SMA. Associated with non bleeding varices and
   chronic anemia thrombocytopenia.
   - liver recs
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to liver disease.  Stable.
   - transfuse for plt > 50 if actively bleeding
   .
   # Syncope/falls: Unclear etiology but possibilities include volume
   depletion v cardiac v etoh related. ECHO negative, tele without events,
   Carotid us w mild stenosis. Positive orthostatics until recently
   suggest volume down.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted to the MICU for restlessness and suspected alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been experiencing seizures, tachycardia, and hypertension, which are all potential complications of alcohol withdrawal. Other possible complications include hypovolemic hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and syncope/falls. The patient's liver disease is likely contributing to her thrombocytopenia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient may continue to experience symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as restlessness, agitation, seizures, and autonomic instability. 
2. Seizures: The patient has already experienced a seizure, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal. Further seizures are possible.
3. Hypovolemic hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, likely due to volume depletion. This can lead to symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and seizures.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
5. Syncope/falls: The patient has experienced falls, which could be due to various causes including volume depletion, cardiac issues, or alcohol-related effects.
6. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's cirrhosis increases the risk of hepatic en"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse/dependence. She was transferred to the MICU for restlessness and concerns of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has received 18 mg of lorazepam (Ativan) since the onset of seizure. She is currently on various medications, including heparin sodium, lorazepam, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. Her weight has decreased from 74.1 kg at admission to 70.1 kg. Fluid balance shows a deficit of 100 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 99%. Her ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation. The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the HEENT, neck, lungs, CV, abdomen, GU, or extremities. Laboratory values show slightly abnormal results for hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, platelet count, creatinine, troponin-T, glucose, PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, and LDH. The assessment and plan include management for alcohol withdrawal, tachycardia, hypertension, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, syncope/falls, diabetes mellitus, and potential medical complications such as DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

   although neurology did evaluate patient and other etiologies are being
   considered. At this time she appears comfortable, with mildly agitated
   delirium and stable hemodynamics.
   For today will continue close monitoring and liberal use of benzos.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old individual with chronic ethanol (EtOH) use who presented with recurrent syncope and was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a seizure on the floor. The patient has an increasing requirement for benzodiazepines (benzo) and shows signs of agitation and delirium.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 112/67 to 169/139 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented to year only, but exhibits muscle wasting and warm skin. Neurologic examination reveals no motor deficits.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly low platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with syncope, hepatorenal syndrome, hypotension (not in shock), falls, alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures), thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Seizure recurrence due to ongoing alcohol withdrawal.
2. Worsening delirium and agitation.
3. Development of complications related to hepatorenal syndrome, such"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with chronic EtOH use who presented with recurrent syncope and was transferred to the MICU after experiencing a seizure on the floor. The patient has been receiving increasing amounts of benzodiazepines (benzo requirement) and has persistently altered mental status. The etiology of the seizure is most likely EtOH withdrawal, although other neurologic causes are being considered. The patient appears comfortable, with mildly agitated delirium and stable hemodynamics. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has a history of chronic EtOH use, which can lead to liver dysfunction and subsequent hepatorenal syndrome. This condition involves kidney failure due to advanced liver disease.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. If not managed properly, it could lead to shock.
3. FALLS: The patient has a history of recurrent syncope, which increases the risk of falls and potential injuries.
4. ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES): Chronic alcohol use can result in withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens, seizures, and other complications.
5. THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: The patient has a low platelet count, which can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and alcohol abuse/dependence. She was transferred to the MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal. The patient received 18 mg of Ativan total in 18 hours for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, lactulose and rifaximin were also administered. Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained. The patient has been seizure-free since being on the floor, but continues to receive lorazepam as needed based on neurological recommendations. A head CT was negative, and an EEG is still pending. The patient's tachycardia improved with an IVF bolus and Ativan, and her hypertension improved with Ativan as well. It is suggested to consider lisinopril if hypertension persists. The patient has cirrhosis, likely due to alcohol abuse, although an immune process is also possible given a positive SMA. This is associated with non-bleeding varices and chronic anemia with thrombocytopenia. Liver recommendations were provided. The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely secondary to liver disease and is currently stable. Transfusion is recommended for a platelet count of less than 50,000 if active bleeding occurs. The etiology of the patient's syncope/falls is unclear, but possibilities include volume depletion, cardiac issues, or alcohol-related causes.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse/dependence. She was admitted to the MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has received 8 mg of Ativan over the past 24 hours, which has improved her condition from the previous day. She is oriented x3 today. The patient is being monitored for alcohol withdrawal, tachycardia, hypertension, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, syncope/falls, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk for complications associated with alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may be due to alcohol withdrawal, volume depletion, or pain. If left untreated, it could lead to complications like arrhythmias and cardiovascular instability.
3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension may be related to alcohol withdrawal or essential hypertension. If not managed properly, it could increase the risk of cardiovascular events like stroke or heart attack.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is likely related to alcohol abuse. It can lead to complications such as portal hypertension, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of long-standing ethanol abuse. He presented with recurrent syncope or unclear etiology and is now experiencing a seizure likely due to ethanol withdrawal. The patient has been stable with close monitoring and intermittent lorazepam but remains in delirium tremens and requires continued close monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a type of kidney failure that can occur in patients with severe liver disease, such as alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
2. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, which can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs.
3. Fall(s): The patient has a history of recurrent falls, which can increase the risk of injury.
4. Alcohol Withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient is experiencing withdrawal symptoms from ethanol, which can progress to more severe complications like delirium tremens and seizures.
5. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding or bruising.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. It is important for a healthcare professional to evaluate the patient in person and consider additional factors to provide an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   # Hypertension: EtOH withdrawal vs essential. Improved with ativan.
   - consider lisinopril if HTN persists
   # Cirrhosis:  Alcoholic in nature, although possible immune process as
   well given positive SMA. Associated with non bleeding varices and
   chronic anemia thrombocytopenia.
   - liver reccs
   # Thrombocytopenia:  Likely secondary to liver disease.  Stable.
   - transfuse for plt > 50 if actively bleeding
   # Syncope/falls: Unclear etiology but possibilities include volume
   depletion v cardiac v etoh related. ECHO negative, tele without events,
   Carotid us w mild stenosis. Positive orthostatics until recently
   suggest volume down.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), and alcohol abuse/dependence. She was transferred to the MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal. The patient has been improving with benzodiazepine treatment and is now alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/76 mmHg to 167/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient's fluid balance shows a net intake of 5,389 mL and output of 1,445 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,944 mL. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 4.5-6.8 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at 140 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 59 U/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, with the exception of potassium at 3.1 mEq/L.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 132/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has received IV thiamine as per neuro recommendations and is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium. Other ICU medications include nutrition support with Nutren Pulmonary at 45 mL/hour and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with slightly elevated creatinine and liver enzymes. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

Based on the patient's history and current condition, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been noted to have hypotension, which may require close monitoring and prompt intervention to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and history of liver disease may increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome, a serious complication characterized by kidney dysfunction due to severe liver disease.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a higher risk of bleeding complications.

","Summary:
- 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes, cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse/dependence
- Transferred to MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal
- Currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, tachycardia, hypertension, cirrhosis, thrombocytopenia, and syncope/falls

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal seizures: The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal and is currently on Ativan per CIWA scale to manage withdrawal symptoms. Monitoring for seizures is important, especially since the patient had a seizure in the past.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. This condition is characterized by confusion, altered level of consciousness, and other neurological symptoms. Monitoring for these symptoms is necessary.
3. Variceal bleeding: Cirrhosis can also cause the development of varices (enlarged veins) in the esophagus or stomach, which have a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding, such as black tarry stools or vomiting blood, is essential.
4. Hepatitis: The positive SMA (smooth muscle antibody) suggests the possibility of an immune process contributing to the cirrhosis. Hepatitis, an inflammation of the liver, could be a potential cause and should be considered.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing D"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of long-standing ethanol abuse. She presented with recurrent syncope or unclear etiology and was readmitted to the MICU with a seizure likely from ethanol withdrawal. The patient has been stable with close monitoring and has not had benzodiazepines in 24 hours. Her mental status is improving, and she requires continued close monitoring. She is ready for transfer to the medical floor at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. HEPATORENAL SYNDROME: The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, which can lead to liver damage and subsequent hepatorenal syndrome. This condition occurs when the liver fails to produce enough proteins to maintain blood pressure in the kidneys, resulting in kidney failure.
2. HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK): The patient's blood pressure is low (85/45 mmHg), indicating hypotension. This could be due to various factors such as dehydration, sepsis, or heart failure. Monitoring the patient's blood pressure closely and providing appropriate fluid resuscitation and vasopressors if necessary is important.
3. FALLS: The patient has experienced multiple falls, which can be attributed to her altered mental status due to alcohol withdrawal. Falls in hospitalized patients can result in injuries and complications, so close monitoring and appropriate fall prevention measures should be implemented.
4. ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL (INCLUDING DELIRIUM TREMENS, DTS, SEIZURES): The patient is at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, including delirium tremens and seizures. Close monitoring and prompt administration of benzodiazepines are crucial to prevent withdrawal complications.
5. THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: The patient has a low platelet count (35,000/mm3), indicating acute thrombocytopenia. This can be caused by various factors such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or splenic sequestration. Monitoring the patient's platelet count and coagulation profile is essential, and appropriate interventions should be considered based on the underlying cause.
6. CIRRHOSIS: The patient has a history of chronic alcohol abuse, which can lead to cirrhosis. Monitoring the patient's liver function tests and symptoms related to portal hypertension is important.
7. RECURRENT SYNCOPE: The patient's recurrent syncope requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes include cardiac arrhythmias, neurologic disorders, or orthostatic hypotension. Additional diagnostic tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and neurologic evaluation, may be necessary to identify the cause and guide appropriate management.

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of the patient."

","The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis due to alcohol abuse/dependence, who was transferred to the MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal. She is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, which has improved with lorazepam. She also has sinus tachycardia, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal, volume depletion, or pain. Her blood pressure is elevated, possibly due to alcohol withdrawal or essential hypertension. She has cirrhosis, most likely caused by alcohol abuse, along with associated non-bleeding varices, chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and ascites. There are plans for a liver ultrasound, Lasix trial for diuresis, and large volume paracentesis if no response. She also has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver disease, which is stable. Syncope/falls could be due to volume depletion, cardiac issues, or alcohol-related problems. An echocardiogram was negative, and a telehealth monitoring did not show any events. Carotid ultrasound showed mild stenosis, and orthostatic hypotension has improved recently. The patient has diabetes mellitus and is being managed accordingly. The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of EtOH withdrawal. She has been admitted to the ICU due to her unstable condition. The patient is currently experiencing tachycardia and agitation, which have been addressed with IV fluids and medication. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6 C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/83 to 160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 74.1 kg at admission to 70.1 kg currently. She has received IV fluids and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for the noted below.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium tremens (DTs): This is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can occur in individuals with a history of chronic alcohol use. Symptoms include severe agitation, confusion, hallucinations, and fever. Close monitoring for these symptoms is crucial.
2. Seizures: Alcohol withdrawal can also lead to seizures in some individuals. Continuous EEG monitoring should be considered to detect any seizure activity.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: This condition refers to kidney dysfunction associated with severe liver disease. Given the patient's history of chronic alcohol use, it is important to monitor her liver function tests and renal parameters closely.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU for management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient's medical history is significant for EtOH abuse, but no other known drug allergies or previous antibiotic use. 

Upon admission, the patient presented with tachycardia and agitation, which are common symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The patient was started on IV fluids and administered with Ativan to manage agitation. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate in the 100s, with a blood pressure of 136/83 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits at 20 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is maintained at 99%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are restless but oriented, with no signs of neck stiffness, jugular venous distension, or other focal neurological deficits. 

Laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin levels, and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT). Blood glucose levels are low, indicating a possible need for supplementation. 

The patient's white blood cell count is slightly low, while platelet count is within normal range. Renal function appears to be normal, with no significant abnormalities in electrolytes or kidney function tests. 

The patient's ICU care plan includes nutritional support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, and alcohol abuse/dependence. She was admitted to the MICU for restlessness and concern of alcohol withdrawal. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/83 to 160/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently receiving IV fluids, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and medications for alcohol withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is at risk of experiencing complications related to alcohol withdrawal, such as seizures, delirium tremens, and autonomic instability. Close monitoring and administration of benzodiazepines are necessary to manage these symptoms.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension. It is important to monitor her blood pressure regularly and adjust her antihypertensive medication regimen accordingly.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, which is likely of alcoholic origin. This condition may lead to complications like ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and portal hypertension. Regular monitoring of liver function and appropriate management are essential.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to"

 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE
   56F with long-standing history of EtOH abuse, presented with recurrent
   syncope or unclear etiology, readmitted to MICU with seizure likely
   from EtOH withdrawal. She has been stable with close monitoring. Has
   not had benzos in 24 hours now, mental status improving, needs
   continued close monitoring but is ready for the medical [**Hospital1 **] at this
   point.
   Further work-up of recurrent falls when more awake and when better
   history can be obtained from the patient; work-up so far has been
   negative, though may need MRI for further diagnostic evaluation.
   Presumed cirrhosis/ascites - Tbili and ALP rising. Will do abd/pelv u/s
   with doppler. Therapeutic paracentesis may be needed in next 1-2 days
   but no urgent indication. Bladder pressure 18 cm. Will give trial of
   diuresis first. d/c IVF for now.
   Tachycardia - Etiology unclear, ? discomfort from distended abdomen vs
   intravasc depletion (with 3rd spacing)
   Alcohol abuse - we discussed with her importance of abstaining
   completely. Social work will need to involved prior to discharge. Watch
   for continued signs of withdrawal/DTs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of long-standing ethanol abuse. She presented with recurrent syncope or unclear etiology and was readmitted to the MICU with a seizure likely from ethanol withdrawal. She has been stable with close monitoring and has not had benzodiazepines in 24 hours. Her mental status is improving, and she needs continued close monitoring but is ready for transfer to the medical floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient has signs of liver dysfunction (elevated bilirubin and ALP) and renal impairment (elevated creatinine). Hepatorenal syndrome is a potential complication in patients with advanced liver disease.
2. Hypotension (not in shock), falls: The patient's blood pressure is low (113/58 mmHg), which could contribute to falls. Falls can increase the risk of injury in hospitalized patients.
3. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, seizures): Given the patient's history of ethanol abuse, she is at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Delirium tremens is a severe form of alcohol withdrawal that can be life-threatening.
4. Thrombocytopenia, acute: The patient's platelet count is low (35-82 K/uL), indicating acute thrombocytopenia. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Recurrent falls: The patient has experienced recurrent falls"
