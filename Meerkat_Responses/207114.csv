","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted to the ICU for cardiac tamponade secondary to presumed [Last Name (Prefixes) 3429]. He underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab, resulting in the expression of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood. A repeat echocardiogram 2 hours post-procedure showed resolution of the effusion. The patient also has a pericardial drain with 100cc output since arrival to the ICU at 1pm. He is currently experiencing symptoms of pericardial irritation, including chest pain, and has EKG findings consistent with pericarditis. His blood pressure is borderline, requiring fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60. There is no evidence of tamponade currently. The patient's coronary arteries are reported to have no known history of coronary artery disease (CAD), and his last stress test showed no evidence of ischemia. However, he has risk factors including hypertension and hyperlipidemia. An echocardiogram [6-9] showed normal pump function with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60%, and cardiac MRI [1-9] showed LVEF 65% and normal wall motion with mild mitral regurgitation (MR). The patient underwent an ablation procedure today for his parox"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient presented with chest pain radiating to the back and was found to have cardiac tamponade.
- Pericardiocentesis was performed, resulting in the removal of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood.
- A repeat echo showed resolution of the effusion.
- The patient experienced symptoms of pericardial irritation, including chest pain, and EKG findings consistent with pericarditis.
- Blood pressure was borderline, requiring fluid boluses to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.
- There is no evidence of tamponade currently.
- The plan includes repeating an echo in the morning, considering extubation if the effusion is stable, monitoring serial creatinine levels, removing arterial line if BP stabilizes, and following pericardial drain output.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially had cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart) restricts the heart's ability to pump effectively. This can lead to decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and organ dysfunction.

2. Pericarditis: The patient's symptoms and EKG findings suggest pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium. Pericarditis can cause chest pain, fever, and other systemic symptoms. If left untreated, it may progress to more severe complications such as cardiac tam"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and recent pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade. The patient presented with acute onset chest pain and was found to have a pericardial effusion on TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram). The effusion was aspirated in the EP lab, resulting in the expression of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood. Repeat TTE showed stabilization of the effusion (small), but the patient experienced mild symptoms of pericarditis.

The patient's vital signs have remained stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 107/52 to 123/91 mmHg, heart rate between 72-119 bpm, respiratory rate between 6-33 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 95% on nasal cannula, and temperature within normal limits.

The patient's cardiac function appears to be normal, with an ejection fraction (EF) of >55% on ECHO. There is a small pericardial effusion seen on imaging, but no signs of tamponade. The patient was extubated without difficulty and femoral arterial line was removed.

The patient has been restarted on diltiazem and propafenone for rhythm control, and colchicine has been started for pain relief due to pericard"

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to pulmonary vein isolation complicated by cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab and expressed approximately 1 liter of oxygenated blood. Repeat echocardiograms showed stabilization of effusion (small) and mild symptoms of pericarditis. The patient's blood pressure has remained stable without the need for pressors or fluid boluses post-extubation. He was extubated without difficulty and the femoral arterial line was removed. Pressures have remained stable and the patient went back into atrial flutter, restarting on 30mg of diltiazem as well as his home propafenone. The dose of diltiazem was increased to 60mg in the morning with heart rates between 90-110. The patient continued to have pericarditic pain and was started on colchicine for pain relief.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulates in the pericardium, compressing the heart and impairing its ability to pump blood effectively. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which involved removing the excess fluid from around the heart, relieving the pressure and restoring normal heart function.

   Repeat TTE showed slightly enlarged pocket of fluid (1/3 cm) anterior
   to RV without tamponade physiology.  Repeated flush showed only straw
   colored inflammatory fluid.   Total drain output of 350cc, mostly by
   passive drainage. Hct has remained stable.  Patient was extubated
   without difficulty.  Femoral arterial line was removed.  Pressures have
   remained stable.  Patient went back into AF, and was restarted on 30mg
   (compared to 90mg home dose) dilt, as well as his home propafonone.
   Both were tolerated well, and patient to have dilt dose increased to
   60mg in AM with HRs 90-110.  Continued to have pericarditic pain, and

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 81-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing cardiac tamponade, which required pericardiocentesis. The procedure involved removing approximately 1L of oxygenated blood from the pericardial space. Repeat echocardiogram showed resolution of the effusion. The patient received 3500cc IV fluids during the procedure, resulting in a drop in hematocrit from 37% to 32%. His blood pressure has stabilized in the 80s-90s range. The patient appears dry on examination. Cardiac surgery is aware of the potential need for surgery if there are signs of tamponade or continued bleeding from the pericardial drain.

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and underwent an ablation procedure today. He is now in sinus rhythm post-procedure. The patient also has no known history of coronary artery disease, but has risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 107/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. He is extubated and has been weaned off pressors. His femoral arterial line was removed, and pressures have remained stable."

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, who presented with symptoms of cardiac tamponade. He underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab and had approximately 1 liter of oxygenated blood expressed. Repeat echocardiograms showed stabilization of effusion (small). The patient is experiencing mild symptoms of pericarditis. His blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors or fluid boluses post-extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Tamponade: The patient initially presented with symptoms of cardiac tamponade, which is a potentially life-threatening condition where fluid accumulation in the pericardium (the sac around the heart) restricts the heart's ability to pump effectively. The pericardiocentesis procedure helped to relieve the pressure on the heart, but there is still a small remaining pocket of fluid.

2. Pericarditis: The patient is experiencing mild symptoms of pericarditis, which is inflammation of the pericardium. This can cause chest pain and other symptoms. The patient is being treated with colchicine to minimize side effects.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a known history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm that increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. He underwent an ablation procedure but was terminated early and is currently back in atrial fibrillation. His heart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient presented to the ICU with cardiac tamponade due to a pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab, resulting in the removal of approximately 1L of oxygenated blood. Repeat echocardiograms showed stabilization of the effusion. 

The patient has mild symptoms of pericarditis but is hemodynamically stable without the need for pressors or fluid boluses post-extubation. The drain output has significantly decreased today. 

The patient's cardiac function appears to be normal, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 60% on the echo and 65% on cardiac MRI. There is mild mitral regurgitation (MR). 

The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (Afib), and an ablation procedure was performed, which was terminated early. The patient is currently in and out of atrial fibrillation with rates in the 70-80s. 

The patient's blood pressure is being managed without the use of home anti-hypertensives, except for diltiazem. 

The patient also has hyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor. 

Overall, the patient's current medical complications include cardiac tamponade, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 81-year-old male with a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the ICU with a large left-sided pleural effusion and evidence of cardiac tamponade. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis in the EP lab and had approximately 1L of oxygenated blood expressed. Repeat echos show stabilization of effusion (small). The patient is experiencing mild symptoms of pericarditis. His blood pressure is stable without the need for pressors or fluid boluses post-extubation, and his drain output has significantly decreased today. Hematocrit is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac tamponade: The patient initially presented with signs of cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. It occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial space, leading to impaired filling and reduced cardiac output. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which involves removing fluid from the pericardial space using a needle. This procedure helped relieve the tamponade and stabilize the patient's condition.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a large left-sided pleural effusion, which is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity surrounding the lungs. This can cause respiratory symptoms such as cough and congestion, as seen in the patient. It can also impair lung function and compromise oxygenation.
