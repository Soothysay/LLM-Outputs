   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   74 y/o woman with hx of breast cancer and COPD on 3L O2 presents with
   fever to 101, several days dyspnea, intermittent abdominal pain,
   nausea, and vomiting admitted overnight to ICU.  CXR showed RLL
   opacity; transferred to [**Hospital1 54**] as suspected PNA/COPD exacerbation.
   Further investigation revealed probable cholangitis.
   24 Hour Events:
   Admitted to ICU
   Ultrasound showed stones
   Felt to have cholangitis
   Intubated this morning
   Hypotense to SBP 50s after intubation --> peripheral neosynephrine

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presented with fever, dyspnea, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was admitted to the ICU for suspected pneumonia/COPD exacerbation but further investigation revealed probable cholangitis. The patient required intubation due to respiratory failure and is currently in shock. She has been diagnosed with cholangitis, pneumonia, septic shock, respiratory failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: Infection of the bile ducts, which can lead to sepsis and organ failure if not treated promptly.
2. Pneumonia: Lung infection that can worsen respiratory symptoms and potentially spread to other organs if not effectively managed.
3. Septic Shock: Severe infection-related condition causing low blood pressure, inadequate tissue perfusion, and organ dysfunction.
4. Respiratory Failure: Impaired breathing function that may require mechanical ventilation support.
5. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: Worsening of underlying COPD symptoms, leading to increased shortness of breath, cough, and potential respiratory distress.
6. Breast Cancer: The patient's history of breast cancer may contribute to her overall vulnerability and impact treatment decisions.
7. Complications from Intubation: Potential risks associated with the procedure, including ventilator-associated"

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presents with fever, dyspnea, intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was admitted to the ICU as a suspected pneumonia/COPD exacerbation and further investigation revealed probable cholangitis. 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is experiencing shock, most likely from cholangitis. The plan includes antibiotics coverage for cholangitis, community-acquired pneumonia, and septic shock. ERCP should be done as soon as possible, and the patient will remain intubated until ERCP is completed and hemodynamic stability is achieved.

The patient also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with an acute exacerbation, for which antibiotics and bronchodilators will be administered. Her breast cancer treatment should continue with armedex.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various lines including arterial, peripheral, and central venous access. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis prevention with boots and subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention with head-of-bed elevation, mouth care, and daily wake-up and respiratory system assessment.

Overall, the patient is critically ill and requires close monitoring and management in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with cholangitis who has been admitted to the ICU. She underwent an ERCP procedure, where a single stone was found in the distal CBD and a plastic stent was placed. The patient became hypotensive post-procedure and required the initiation of levophed. She is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure. She has a history of sepsis, respiratory failure, cholangitis, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently receiving antibiotics. Sepsis can be a life-threatening condition if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
3. Cholangitis: The patient has cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. This condition requires ongoing management and may lead to complications such as sepsis or liver dysfunction.
4. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and potential spread of infection.

   Hemodynamically stable, weaned off pressors this morning.  Goal MAP>65.
   Urine output borderline yesterday, given CVP of 7 will rebolus with IVF
   and follow urine output. Will also check urinalysis to assess for
   evidence of casts; in setting of hypotension yesterday could have ATN.
   Will also check urine electrolytes and urine eosinophils.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Good RSBI this morning, did well on SBT, now extubated post rounds. Do
   not think she has a pneumonia. Shortness of breath may have been due to
   abdominal infection, breathing off acidosis. Patient on 3L O2 baseline
   at home.
 CHOLANGITIS
   S/p ERCP yesterday with plastic stent placed. Abdomen benign today with
   improved bilirubins and LFTs. Will need GI followup for biliary stent
   removal. Continue to trend LFTs. Cultures NGTD, afebrile. Check
   differential on CBC. Can discontinue ciprofloxacin today. Continue
   zosyn/vancomycin for 7 day course now day 2, or per GI recommendations.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD who presented with right upper quadrant pain, fever, and shortness of breath. She was found to have cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure where a single stone in the distal CBD was seen and a plastic stent was placed. Post-procedure, the patient became hypotensive without a durable response to IV fluids and thus started on levophed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/54 mmHg to 150/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and her CVP is 7 mmHg.

The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin-tazobactam. She is also receiving fentanyl, norepinephrine, and propofol infusions.

Her laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, lactate, and troponin-T levels. Liver function tests are also abnormal, with increased ALT, AST, and ALKP levels. Kidney function appears to be normal based on the provided parameters.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, as she has been successfully extubated after"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a chief complaint of right upper quadrant pain and cholangitis. She has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, breast cancer, and is currently in the ICU. 

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line and multi-lumen catheter, administration of antibiotics (Vancomycin, Piperacillin, and Ciprofloxacin), and various infusions (Fentanyl, Propofol, etc.). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 65-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/50-150/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 32.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (29.1 K/uL), hematocrit (36.7%), platelet count (367 K/uL), and liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 455/279 U/L). Her blood glucose levels are also elevated (291, 156, 165 mg/dL). The patient has been diagnosed with severe sepsis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), cholangitis, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, hypertension, and breast cancer.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of arterial line stop. The patient has been extubated successfully but had a brief episode of respiratory distress, which responded to nebs and supplemental O2. The patient's subjective complaints include back pain, nausea, and difficulty sleeping. The patient is not experiencing abdominal pain or thirst. 

The patient has allergies to antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin. The patient is currently on various infusions and medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/83 mmHg to 164/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and central venous pressure is within normal range. 

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,359 mL and output of 1,194 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,165 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through CPAP/PSV with an FiO2 of 100%, and their ABG results are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 74-year-old woman, was admitted with biliary obstruction following an ERCP procedure. She experienced hypotension after the ERCP but was weaned off levophed. Her sepsis physiology has resolved, and she is currently at baseline with good oxygen saturation while on a nasal cannula. The patient underwent extubation successfully but had a brief episode of respiratory distress that responded to nebulizers and supplemental oxygen. She is currently alert and oriented, with distant heart sounds and borderline tachycardia. Her lungs show diminished breath sounds bilaterally, and her abdomen is soft with no tenderness. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breast cancer, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, and she has not been having fevers. She is receiving antibiotics for possible gram-negative and enterococcus coverage. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, and elevated liver enzymes. Her imaging shows marked azygos dilation, suggesting volume overload or another cause for elevated central venous pressure. The patient will need a removal of a plastic stent placed during ERCP in six weeks and will continue on zosyn and vancomycin for seven more days. She will be transferred to the floor once her condition stabilizes.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, mastectomy, radiation therapy, hypertension, high cholesterol, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient was initially admitted with cholangitis and respiratory failure due to sepsis and COPD flare, and was treated with BiPAP and elective intubation. She was transferred to the floor yesterday but returned to the ICU today for worsening respiratory distress.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 138/83 to 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished and overweight, with distant heart sounds and diffuse expiratory wheezes. Her extremities show trace edema and cyanosis, but no muscle wasting. Neurological assessment is not available.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal kidney function. Blood chemistry shows elevated levels of glucose, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and lactate. Imaging reveals clearing of right opacity, blunting of right costophrenic angle, and right lower lobe infiltrate.

The assessment and plan include several potential complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual with no acute distress. They have a history of shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, and tachypnea. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia, hypertension, and normal oxygen saturation. Fluid balance shows an intake of 700 mL and output of 1,700 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,000 mL. Respiratory support is provided through aerosol-cool oxygen delivery, with an ABG result of ///42/. The patient's peripheral pulses are not assessed, and their extremities are described as absent on the right and left sides. Skin assessment is not performed, and neurologic examination is incomplete. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of shortness of breath, increased work of breathing, and tachypnea, along with the need for respiratory support, indicates a possible respiratory failure.
2. Cholangitis: The presence of symptoms such as abdominal pain and elevated liver enzymes may suggest an infection in the bile ducts, known as cholangitis.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory symptoms and elevated white blood cell count could indicate a bacterial community-acquired pneumonia.
4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbation: The patient's history of bronchitis, emphysema, and current symptoms may point towards an acute exacerbation"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old obese male who presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and was found to have respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, cholangitis, breast cancer, and hypertension. 

The patient received continuous nebulizers (nebs), which resolved his symptoms of increased work of breathing, tachypnea, and hypoxia. He also received antibiotics (Vanc and Zosyn) for pneumonia and biliary sepsis. The patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement and removal of gallstones, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are trending down. He is being monitored for further evaluation of right hilar nodularity.

The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is elevated, indicating an infection. His hematocrit (Hct) and platelet (Plt) levels are within normal range. The patient's serum creatinine (Cr), carbon dioxide (TCO2), and glucose levels are also within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS): The patient's symptoms have resolved with continuous nebs. He will continue to receive vanc and zosyn for pneumonia, as well as scheduled nebs. A chest CT will be done today for further evaluation of right hilar nodularity.

2. Cholangitis: The patient's LFTs"

","The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of COPD exacerbation, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has been receiving nebs every 4 hours and is not experiencing shortness of breath at this time. She has received antibiotics including Piperacillin-Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Vancomycin. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/58 mmHg to 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient's weight is currently 92 kg, with a height of 65 inches. Fluid balance shows an intake of 700 mL and output of 1700 mL since 12 AM. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. The patient has wheezing bilaterally on respiratory examination. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, oriented to time, place, and person, and able to follow simple commands. However, movement, tone, and skin assessment were not performed. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 36.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 156 K/uL. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 123 mg/dL and 165 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated levels of AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase, with normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows a kink in the central venous line and poor penetration, along with right-sided loss of costophrenic angles on chest X-ray. 

The patient's medical conditions include respiratory failure due to acute COPD flare, improving with steroids and nebs; cholangitis with obstructive cholangitis post ERCP and stenting; bacterial community-acquired pneumonia; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation; hypertension; and breast cancer on Arimidex. 

The plan includes continuing prednisone, nebs, Singulair, and Advair. Steroids should be tapered slowly. The patient should continue on Zosyn and Vancomycin. Follow-up CT is needed for pneumonia evaluation. Spiriva should be restarted at home once neb treatments can be sufficiently spaced out, and Atrovent should be discontinued when Spiriva is restarted. 

In ICU care, nutrition and glycemic control are managed. The patient has multi-lumen lines, with difficult peripheral access and a planned prolonged IV PICC placement. Prophylaxis includes DVT with subcutaneous UF Heparin and stress ulcer with an H2 blocker. The patient's code status is full code, and she is to be transferred to the floor."

   cholangitis, respiratory failure and copd/pna transferred back to icu
   with respiratory distress from COPD exacerbation
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): COPD flare, now improving
   with steroids, nebs
   - Continue Prednisone change to 60 mg/day, nebs albuterol and atrovent,
   singulair, Advair.
   - Taper steroids slowly. Would restart spiriva after  no longer
   requiring frequent nebs
 CHOLANGITIS: Obstructive cholangitis, s/p ERCP and stenting.
   Continued improvement in LFTs.
   - Continue Zosyn, Vanco to complete 14 days, stent removal per IR in 6

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of breast cancer, hypertension, high cholesterol, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted with cholangitis, respiratory failure, and COPD/pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress from a COPD exacerbation. 

24-hour events include improving clinical condition, negative cardiac enzymes, nebulizer treatments every 4 hours, and no shortness of breath. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/58 to 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 36.7, hemoglobin of 32.8%, platelet count of 206,000, creatinine level of 0.6, blood glucose level of 156 mg/dL, and sodium level of 138 mEq/L. The imaging reveals a kink in the central venous line and poor penetration, along with right-sided loss of costophrenic angles on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessments include respiratory failure due to COPD flare-up, which is improving with steroids and nebulizer treatments. Cholangitis is also present, with continued improvement in liver function tests after ERCP and stenting. The patient also has bacterial pneumonia, for which she is receiving antibiotics. Additionally, the patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an acute exacerbation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and COPD exacerbation put her at risk for further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of bacterial pneumonia increases the risk of worsening infection and sepsis. Regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, such as white blood cell count, is essential.
3. Cholangitis: Although the patient's liver function tests are improving, there is still a risk of complications related to cholangitis, such as recurrent biliary obstruction or infection.
4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD may lead to increased symptoms and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation if needed.
5. Cardiovascular Issues: The patient's hypertension and potential cardiac involvement due to breast cancer treatment could increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Monitoring blood pressure and cardiac enzymes is crucial.

The patient's condition appears to be improving, but close monitoring and appropriate management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure the best possible outcome."
