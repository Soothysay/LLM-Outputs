   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo F with metastatic breast cancer presents with vomitting, poor po
   intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure with hyponatremia.
   .
   # Tachycardia:  Likely hypovolemic based on  her hydration status
   still dry, very thirsty.  HR in 120s -150.  PE is also a possibility
   and will keep this on the differential if not responsive to fluid.
   -          Bolus 1L NS over 1 hour
   -          Monitor HR
   # Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history, likely
   hypovolemic hyponatremia. Most likely Gi losses combined with third
   spacing in the setting of ascites. Must be care with correcting Na to
   avoid osmotic demylenation. Baseline Na is around 130, so FW deficit is
   about 6.6 L on admission and about 2.5 L since ED resusication. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   a component of underlying SIADH. Uremia is far out of proportion to Cr
   increase, which may represent patient's cachectic state.
   - Na this AM 130, hyponatremia resolved
   - No obvious infection and bandemia improving. Hold antibiotics for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely related to hypovolemia. Now improved while lying in
   bed. LENI negative, and cant do CTA to rule out PA. Dyspnea has largely
   resolved, but Pt still tachycardic and w/ some chest pain.
   - F/[**Location 39**] CXR read
   - Repeat EKG in AM
   -  Consider eval for PE
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely due to poor po intake and nausea/vomitting.
   - Pt at baseline SBP this AM
   .
   # Leukpenia: Likely chemo related, as last dose was [**3-1**]. ANC 600 so not
   yet neutropenic.
   - Consider starting neupogen
   - Plan to transfer to OMED in AM for further management
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Continue synthroid
   .
   # Breast cancer: Onc c/s in AM
   .
   # FEN: NS 100ccx1L, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who presented with vomiting, poor oral intake, and dyspnea. She is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is consistently elevated, ranging from 104 to 131 beats per minute. This could be due to hypovolemia or possibly pericarditis. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: The patient has low sodium levels in her blood, which could be caused by hypovolemia, gastrointestinal losses, and third spacing in the setting of ascites. The healthcare team must be cautious when correcting the sodium levels to avoid osmotic demyelination. The patient's baseline sodium level is around 130, indicating a fluid deficit of about 6.6 liters on admission and about 2.5 liters since emergency resuscitation. There is also a possibility of underlying SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone secretion).

3. Dyspnea: The patient's difficulty breathing is likely related to hypovolemia. Her dyspnea has improved while lying in bed, but she still experiences some chest pain. A chest X-ray has been ordered, and further evaluation for pulmonary embolism is being considered.

4. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure is likely due to poor"

   69 yo F with metastatic breast cancer presents with vomitting, poor po
   intake and dyspnea and to be in acute renal failure with hyponatremia.
   .
   # Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: Based on exam and history, likely
   hypovolemic hyponatremia. Most likely Gi losses combined with third
   spacing in the setting of ascites. Must be care with correcting Na to
   avoid osmotic demylenation. Baseline Na is around 130, so FW deficit is
   about 6.6 L on admission and about 2.5 L since ED resusication. [**Month (only) 51**] be
   a component of underlying SIADH. Uremia is far out of proportion to Cr
   increase, which may represent patient's cachectic state.
   - Na this AM 130, hyponatremia resolved
   - No obvious infection and bandemia improving. Hold antibiotics for now
   .
   # Dyspnea: Likely related to hypovolemia. Now improved while lying in
   bed. LENI negative, and cant do CTA to rule out PA. Dyspnea has largely
   resolved, but Pt still tachycardic and w/ some chest pain.
   - F/[**Location 39**] CXR read

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with vomiting, poor oral intake, and dyspnea. She is currently in the ICU due to acute renal failure with hyponatremia. The patient has a history of allergies to naproxen, codeine, aspirin, and oxycodone. She received a bolus of 500 cc of lactated Ringer's solution overnight and remains tachycardic in the range of 100-110 bpm. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 112/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 53.2 kg, with a total input of 4,053 mL and total output of 1,452 mL since admission. Her urine output is 1,352 mL, and she has received 3,373 mL of IV fluids. The patient has a white blood cell count of 1.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.2 g/dL, platelet count of 311 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 27 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, and sodium level of 130 mEq/L. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and her ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings include tachycardia, regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, clear lungs, soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds, warm extremities without clubbing or cyanosis, and no cough, conjunctivitis, or sinusitis. The patient has ongoing labs and radiology tests pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia/Acute renal failure: The patient is currently experiencing hyponatremia and acute renal failure. There is a need to carefully correct the sodium levels to avoid osmotic demyelination. Given the patient's underlying SIADH and cachectic state, uremia may be present despite the relatively normal creatinine levels. Monitoring of electrolyte levels and renal function is essential to prevent further complications.

2. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea is likely related to hypovolemia, which has improved while lying in bed. However, the patient remains tachycardic and experiences some chest pain. Further evaluation for pulmonary embolism (PE) is recommended due to the persistent symptoms and the high risk of thromboembolism in cancer patients. Repeat EKG and evaluation for PE should be considered.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to poor oral intake and nausea/vomiting. Ensuring adequate fluid resuscitation and addressing the underlying causes of poor oral intake are important to prevent further hypotension and potential organ dysfunction.

4. Leukopenia: The patient is likely experiencing leukopenia due to chemotherapy, with an ANC of 600. It is important to monitor the white blood cell count and consider the use of growth factors such as Neupogen to stimulate white blood cell production and prevent neutropenia.

5. Hypothy"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer presenting with vomiting, poor oral intake, and dyspnea. The patient is currently in acute renal failure with hyponatremia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachycardia and dyspnea raise concern for a possible PE, especially considering the presence of active malignancy. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been ordered to evaluate this possibility.
2. Worsening renal function: Although the patient's creatinine (Cr) level has improved, it is still not back to baseline. Close monitoring of renal function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia continues to improve, but regular monitoring of sodium levels is necessary to avoid complications associated with electrolyte imbalance.
4. Infection: The patient's leukopenia may indicate an increased risk of infection. Frequent assessment of white blood cell count and prompt treatment of any signs of infection are crucial.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's altered nutrition and immobilization in the ICU can increase the risk of pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and appropriate interventions are needed to prevent skin breakdown.
6. Pain management: The patient requires effective pain control due to acute and chronic pain associated with her cancer. Proper assessment and management of pain are important"

   1)SHOCK--Hypovolemic Shock with associated renal failure which has
   shown substantial improvement with volume replacement
   -PRN fluid bolus as needed
   -Maintain even fluid balance today
   2)TACHYCARDIA-Differential diagnosis for sinus tach does include pain
   and anxiety but that is not obviously present.  She does have complaint
   of dyspnea and with sinus tachycardia certainly concern for PE has been
   raised and patient does have risk based upon malignancy--this is
   perhaps supported by mild tachypnea as well.  She, however, may still
   have a substantial component of hypovolemia.
   -Will provide fluid bolus
   -LENI is negative
   -Will look to room air ABG to evalaute for possible A-a gradient
   hypoxia
   -V/Q scan is certianly reasonable to consider in what is otherwise well
   preserved lung parenchyma
   3)Acute Renal Failure-Much improved wtih fluids given suggesting
   relatively minimal insult from ATN at this time.
   -Fluid bolus for poor urine output
   -Renal dose medications
   -Avoid nephrotoxic agents.

   -Continue nystatin
   -Pain control

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the peritoneum.
- She was admitted with hypotension, hypovolemia, and hyponatremia.
- Initial treatment included intravenous fluid resuscitation.
- The patient's condition has shown substantial improvement with volume replacement.
- Current assessments and plans include:
   1) Hypovolemic shock with associated renal failure, which has improved with fluid resuscitation.
   2) Sinus tachycardia, possibly due to pain, anxiety, hypovolemia, or pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation is needed, including a V/Q scan to assess for PE.
   3) Acute renal failure, which has improved with fluids given.
   4) Breast cancer, with ongoing management including pain control and monitoring of ascites.
- The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is DNR/DNI.

   69yo F with h/o metastatic breast CA admitted with dyspnea,
   tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension.

   #. Dyspnea:. As patient has high risk of PE with associated tachycardia
   attempted V/Q scan on [**3-10**] to r/o PE. Other possible cause might be
   infectious etiology, but CXR negative so bacterial PNA very unlikely.
   She is on chemotherapy so possible she could have PCP as well as viral
   bronchitis. CXR and exam do not suggest heart failure although BNP was
   elevated on admission. Consider also deconditioning in setting of poor
   po intake and chemo. Patient also has history of requiring frequent
   paracenteses since [**9-2**] (14 since that time)- dyspnea could also be d/t
   component of associated abdominal pain from known loculated ascites;
   also patient reports pain localized to epigastrium; although unlikely,
   will r/o pancreatitis in setting of n/v as well.
   - If persistent tachycardia despite IVF resuscitation, CTA chest with
   prehydration
   - f/u lipase/amylase
   - nothing on exam, lab, or cxr to suggest pna.
   -palliative paracentesis
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Patient with baseline heart rate 110s-120s per notes
   from recent admission. This may be secondary to pain, malignancy.
   Current HRs higher than baseline suggesting other current cause.
   Possibilities include dehydration, supported by the fact that the
   tachycardia improves with IVF, PE, although patient is not hypoxic, and
   infection although patient has not been febrile.
   - EKG without acute change, largely normal TTE.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - f/u blood cultures
   -CTA as above if persistent
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Currently at 134 after fluid resusitation suggesting
   hypovolemia was cause. Likely this is from poor po intake, nausea, and
   vomiting secondary to chemotherapy. Has had in past and has been
   responsive to fluids then as well - thought secondary to dehydration.
   - Recheck sodium in pm to ensure hasnot changed to dramatically from
   this am
   - IVF as above
   - Consider urine lytes, osms if persists after IVF

   #. Hypotension: Resolved after IVF so likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia.

   #. Acute renal failure: Initial creatinine 1.6 now downtrending to 0.9
   yesterday after aggressive IVF, slightly increased to 1.2 this morning.
   Likely [**1-26**] prerenal azotemia in setting of dehydration initially,

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. She has a high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) and is being evaluated for this possibility. Other potential causes of her symptoms include infectious etiology, heart failure, deconditioning due to poor oral intake and chemotherapy, and pain from loculated ascites. The patient also has a history of requiring frequent paracenteses and reports abdominal pain localized to the epigastrium.

Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's dyspnea could be due to various reasons such as PE, infectious etiology, heart failure, deconditioning, or pain from loculated ascites. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's persistent tachycardia may be secondary to pain, malignancy, dehydration, PE, or infection. IVF resuscitation has improved her heart rate, suggesting dehydration as a possible cause.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is likely due to hypovolemia caused by poor oral intake, nausea, and vomiting secondary to chemotherapy. Fluid resuscitation has improved her sodium levels, but monitoring is required.
4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was resolved after IV"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 51-year-old female with an unspecified chief complaint. The patient experienced several events within the 24-hour period. She was unable to tolerate a VQ scan, specifically the ventilation component and could not lie flat. An abdominal ultrasound confirmed moderate ascites, with the largest pocket located in the right lower quadrant and multiple septations, indicating loculated fluid. IVF boluses were given for low urine output, and the patient's creatinine levels improved from 1.1 to 0.9 on the previous day's labs. The patient's daughter requested paracentesis and wants to discuss the removal of the patient's port with the IR PA. The possibility of palliative abdominal pleurex for frequent [Doctor's First Name] was also discussed. The patient received boluses of 500cc x 2 for low blood pressure. Allergies include Naproxen, facial swelling; Codeine, nausea/vomiting; Aspirin, swelling/edema; and Oxycontin (Oral), nausea/vomiting. The patient has been on various ICU medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications have also been administered. There were no changes to the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 124 bpm (116-147), blood pressure of 80/66 mmHg (69-115/72), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (15-36), and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's weight is 51.9 kg, which is the same as at admission. Fluid balance shows a total input of 4869 mL and output of 783 mL, resulting in a balance of 4086 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and the patient's ABG results are pending. Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic status, and other areas. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, with decreased creatinine levels. Imaging shows moderate ascites with loculated fluid in the right lower quadrant. Microbiology results are negative for Cltx in urine and NGTD in blood. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP."

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo female with metastatic breast cancer with substantial omental
   involvement and recurrent and persistent ascites.  She has maintained a
   stable but substantially elevated heart rate across time despite IVF
   balance being substantially positive.
   1)Tachycardia-patient with mild discomfort and persistent tachycardia.
   We do have some modest increase in RR in the setting of ascites but
   this is less likely all attributable to single source of chest wall
   restriction.  We are left with possible PE at this time.  Patient is 4
   liters positive across the past 24 hours.
   -Will have to continue with adequate fluid support in the setting of
   ascites and possible insensible losses
   -Will puruse CTA if tachycardia unable to resolve tachycardia with pain
   management and support of hypovolemia
   -Do have concern for risk of anticoagulation and risk in terms of renal
   failure with dye load
   2)Respiratory Distress-Modest increase in RR and with peristent O2
   requirement
   -Will have to discuss timing and strategy for paracentesis with primary
   oncology team and with regular drainage required indwelling catheter
   may be best path to pursue
   -Wean O2 as tolerated
   -WBC increased and with neutropenia improved may be reasonable time to
   move to fluid drainage.
   3)Breat Cancer
Metastatic
   -Palliative Rx as above with drainage of ascitic fluid intermittently
   required
   -Continue with pain control

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, omental involvement, and recurrent persistent ascites. She is currently in the ICU due to tachycardia, hypovolemia with hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has a history of allergies to Naproxen, facial swelling; Codeine, nausea/vomiting; Aspirin, swelling/edema; and Oxycontin (Oral) Oxycodone Hcl, nausea/vomiting. She is on various medications including Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, Pantoprazole (Protonix), and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99%), heart rate of 128 bpm (116-147 bpm), blood pressure of 87/63 mmHg (69-111/72 mmHg), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (14-36 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be thin, with normocephalic head, ears, nose, and throat. Cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and distant S2 heart sounds. Peripheral vascular pulses are not assessed. Respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion, dullness, and diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination notes soft, non-t"

   Assessment and Plan
   69yo F with h/o metastatic breast CA admitted with dyspnea,
   tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension.
   # Dyspnea: As patient has high risk of PE with associated tachycardia
   attempted V/Q scan on [**3-10**] to r/o PE. Other possible cause might be
   infectious etiology, but CXR/UA negative. Likely multifactorial given
   deconditioning, ascites, and abdominal pain.
   - If persistent tachycardia despite IVF resuscitation, CTA chest with
   prehydration
   - Peritoneal catheter placement today
   # Tachycardia: Patient with baseline heart rate 110s-120s per notes
   from recent admission. This may be secondary to pain, malignancy.
   Current HRs higher than baseline, possibilities include dehydration,
   PE, and less likely infection. EKG without acute change, largely normal
   TTE.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - f/u blood cultures
   -CTA as above if persistent
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider urine lytes, osms if persists after IVF
   # Hypotension: Improves transiently with IVF so likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia,
   but despite significant IVF, blood pressure downtrending due to 3^rd
   spacing of fluids. This may be exacerbated by poor nutrition -> low
   albumin & low oncotic pressure.
   - Monitor today
   - Nutrition consult
   - IVF PRN
   # Acute renal failure: 1.4 despite IVF
s, likely [**1-26**] third spacing of
   fluids with ascites.
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Dose meds for GFR
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Stage III 1.5 cm decubitus sacral ulcer. Wound care
   are following.
   -Appreciate wound care recs and will follow their instructions.
   # Breast Cancer: Oncology is following and will take her on OMED
   service when she is stable enough to be on the floor.
   - Follow up onc recs
   # Neutropenia: Resolved. Likely from chemotherapy, but WBC 11.5 today.
   - Hold neupogen
   - Monitor counts daily
   - D/C Neutropenic precautions
   # Oral thrush:
   - Continue nystatin for thrush and morphine IR for pain control
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 2.6.
   - Continue Levothyroxine

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with various medical conditions including dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, hypotension, acute renal failure, decubitus ulcer, breast cancer, neutropenia, oral thrush, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's high risk for PE is indicated by her dyspnea and tachycardia. A V/Q scan was attempted to rule out PE, but it might need to be repeated or followed up with a CT angiography (CTA) if the tachycardia persists despite fluid resuscitation.
2. Infection: The patient has signs of potential infection, such as neutropenia and oral thrush. Blood cultures should be obtained, and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be initiated if necessary.
3. Hypovolemia: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemia, which has partially resolved with IV fluid resuscitation. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary to ensure adequate volume status.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level of 1.4 indicates acute renal failure, likely secondary to third spacing of"

   69yo F with h/o metastatic breast CA admitted with dyspnea,
   tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension.
   # Leukocytosis: Infection vs. inflammatory vs. medication. Patient with
   new leukocytosis to 11.5 today up from 3 yesterday. Afebrile, no
   abdominal pain, diarrhea/nausea/vomiting, but not taking PO
s and on
   admission patient did have some vomiting and abdominal pain. No upper
   respiratory symptoms, headache, or pain with urination, but with mild
   ongoing confusion and no recent head imaging. UA/Ucx & CXR negative.
   Normal lipase.
   - Send C. diff
   - F/u blood cx
   # Dyspnea: As patient has high risk of PE with associated tachycardia
   attempted V/Q scan on [**3-10**] to r/o PE. Other possible cause might be
   infectious etiology, but CXR/UA negative. Likely multifactorial given
   deconditioning, ascites, and abdominal pain.
   - If persistent tachycardia despite IVF resuscitation, CTA chest with
   prehydration
   - Peritoneal catheter placement today
   # Tachycardia: Patient with baseline heart rate 110s-120s per notes
   from recent admission. This may be secondary to pain, malignancy.
   Current HRs higher than baseline, possibilities include dehydration,
   PE, and less likely infection. EKG without acute change, largely normal
   TTE.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - f/u blood cultures
   -CTA as above if persistent
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider urine lytes, osms if persists after IVF
   # Hypotension: Improves transiently with IVF so likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia,
   but despite significant IVF, blood pressure downtrending due to 3^rd
   spacing of fluids. This may be exacerbated by poor nutrition -> low
   albumin & low oncotic pressure.
   - Monitor today

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. She has leukocytosis, potentially due to infection, medication, or an inflammatory response. The patient also has dyspnea, which may be caused by a pulmonary embolism or an infectious etiology. She is experiencing tachycardia, which could be secondary to pain, malignancy, dehydration, or a pulmonary embolism. The patient has resolved hyponatremia and hypotension with fluid resuscitation, but she still requires ongoing IVF. She has acute renal failure likely due to third spacing of fluids with ascites. The patient also has a stage III decubitus ulcer, breast cancer being managed by oncology, resolved neutropenia, oral thrush, and hypothyroidism. She is on various prophylactic medications including SQ UF heparin for DVT, PPI for stress ulcers, and antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has a DNR code status and is awaiting placement of a peritoneal catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's dyspnea and tachycardia could be indicative of a PE, which is a common complication in cancer patients due to hypercoagulability."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. The patient's leukocyte count has increased from 3 to 11.5, indicating leukocytosis. There are no signs of fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea/nausea/vomiting, or upper respiratory symptoms. The patient is confused and has a history of vomiting and abdominal pain. Urine analysis and chest X-ray results are negative. The patient's TSH level is within normal range, suggesting that hypothyroidism is not present. The patient has a decubitus ulcer on the sacrum, stage III, and is being treated with wound care. The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to third spacing of fluids with ascites. The patient's neutropenia has resolved, but the white blood cell count is now elevated. The patient has oral thrush and hypothyroidism. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated leukocyte count suggests the possibility of an infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source and treat accordingly.
2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's dyspnea and tachycardia raise concerns for a possible PE. A V/Q scan was attempted to rule out"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who was admitted with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. She has been experiencing leukocytosis, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. The patient's respiratory support is not needed, but she is mildly confused with an altered level of consciousness. Physical examination findings include pitting edema to the ankles bilaterally, a moderately distended abdomen with minimal bowel sounds, and a stage III decubitus sacral ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count), which could indicate an infection. The differential diagnosis includes infection, inflammation, or medication-related causes. The patient's confusion may also be attributed to an infection. Further evaluation is recommended, including sending a C. difficile test and obtaining follow-up blood cultures.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, likely secondary to pain, malignancy, dehydration, pulmonary embolism (PE), or less likely infection. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions such as IV fluid bolus, follow-up blood cultures, and considering a computed tomography angiography (CTA) if persistent tachycardia are warranted.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels were low, but"

   attempted V/Q scan on [**3-10**] to r/o PE. Other possible cause might be
   infectious etiology, but CXR/UA negative. Likely multifactorial given
   deconditioning, ascites, and abdominal pain.
   - If persistent tachycardia despite IVF resuscitation, CTA chest with
   prehydration
   - Peritoneal catheter placement today
   # Tachycardia: Patient with baseline heart rate 110s-120s per notes
   from recent admission. This may be secondary to pain, malignancy.
   Current HRs higher than baseline, possibilities include dehydration,
   PE, and less likely infection. EKG without acute change, largely normal
   TTE.

   -CTA as above if persistent
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   - IVF as above
   - Consider urine lytes, osms if persists after IVF
   # Hypotension: Improves transiently with IVF so likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia,

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU with dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. The patient's condition appears to be complicated by several factors:

1. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has increased to 11.5 today, up from 3 yesterday. This could indicate an infection or inflammatory response.

2. Dyspnea: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, which may be due to a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), deconditioning, ascites, or an infectious etiology. A V/Q scan was attempted to rule out PE.

3. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, possibly secondary to pain, malignancy, dehydration, or a PE. EKG findings are largely normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal any acute changes.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially low but have resolved with fluid resuscitation. Further evaluation of urine electrolytes and osmolality may be necessary if the hyponatremia persists.

5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low and may be due to hypovolemia, third spacing of fluids, poor nutrition, and low oncotic pressure. Close monitoring, IV fluid administration, and consideration of nutrition"

   Assessment and Plan
   69 yo female with metastatic breast cancer now admitted with worsening
   overall function and has been found to have significant hypovolemia in
   addition to persistent ascites and now has had catheter placed for
   palliative support of management of ascites in the setting of known
   peritoneal studding from metastatic cancer.
   1)Ascites-
   -Zofran in place
   -Catheter placed and 1 liter removed
   -Intermittent drainage as needed
   -Will send fluid for cell count
   2)Tachycardia-patient maintains sinus tachycardia with pain, anxiety,
   ascites all driving persistent tachycardia at this time with hypoxia
   resolved.  We do have concern for possible infection with rising WBC
   count for possible infection.
   -C. diff to be sent
   -Fluid for cell count
   -Will start with empiric antibiotics if fever clearly seen which is not
   in evidence at this time
   3)Breast Cancer-
   -Continue with standing and PRN pain control
lidoacine patch
   -Will need continued nutritional support to be tightly monitored
   -Drainage in place for ascites
   -Patient with concern for limited duration of life going forward given
   the slow trend to worse over time without single, reversible element
   seen
   4)Dyspnea
This would appear to be multifactorial.   We had some concern
   for PE raised by admitting team but have LENI negative.  We attempted
   V/Q scan but patient unable.  CTA carries substantial risk for patient
   in terms of renal function and patient not able to lie flat and would
   require intubation for conduct of test in the setting of low
   probability for PE and with real concern for alternative explanation of
   dyspnea and tachycardia with significant chest wall restriction with
   ascites and metastatic cancer.  The argument against significant PE is
   also in large part made by the fact that patient did not have and does
   not maintain significant hypoxia with room air at this time.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for worsening overall function, significant hypovolemia, persistent ascites, and peritoneal studding from metastatic cancer. The patient has dyspnea, tachycardia, and ascites as her chief complaints.

During her stay in the ICU, the patient underwent various interventions and treatments. A peritoneal catheter was placed for palliative management of ascites. She received IV fluids, which initially showed transient improvement but led to a slow decline over the past few hours. The patient also had medications administered, including antacids, antibiotics, and pain control.

The patient's vital signs were monitored regularly, showing a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate between 111-133 bpm. Her blood pressure ranged from 70/49-100/61 mmHg, respiratory rate was between 13-23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was consistently above 98%. Her temperature was within normal range.

Laboratory results indicated elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The patient's creatinine (Cr) levels were slightly elevated, while her glucose levels were mostly within normal range. Troponin-T levels were below 0.01, suggesting no evidence of myocardial injury. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, were also within acceptable ranges.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer. She is currently admitted for worsening overall function and significant hypovolemia, in addition to persistent ascites. A peritoneal catheter has been placed for palliative management of ascites.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/61 to 112/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of allergies to naproxen, codeine, and aspirin, resulting in facial swelling and edema. She also experiences nausea and vomiting with Oxycontin.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 11.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.4 g/dL, and platelet count of 395 K/uL. Other lab values show slightly elevated creatinine levels and normal glucose levels. Electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypovolemia: The patient's significant hypovolemia indicates a potential risk for decreased blood flow to vital organs, which can lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not properly managed.

2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which may be a compensatory mechanism in response to hypovolem"

   tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension.
   # SBP: Patient with new leukocytosis to 11.5 yesterday, peritoneal
   fluid from catheter demonstrated WBC 4260, 92% PMNs. Afebrile, no
   abdominal pain, diarrhea/nausea/vomiting, but not taking PO
   Receiving antibiotics & albumin.  WBC down to 7.5 today.
   - Continue Ceftriaxone 1g q24H
   - Albumin tomorrow 1g/kg
   - F/u blood cx
   # Goals of care: Family had meeting with palliative care yesterday,
   agreed to make patient comfort measures, save for treatment for SBP.
   Will transition to hospice.
   - Called out to OMED today.
   - SW consult
   # Tachycardia: Patient with baseline heart rate 110s-120s per notes
   from recent admission. This may be secondary to pain, malignancy.
   Current at baseline.
   - IVF bolus PRN
   - f/u blood cultures
   - Treat SBP
   # Hypotension: Improves transiently with IVF so likely [**1-26**] hypovolemia,
   but despite significant IVF, blood pressure downtrending due to 3^rd
   spacing of fluids. This may be exacerbated by poor nutrition -> low
   albumin & low oncotic pressure.
   - Monitor
   - IVF PRN
   # Acute renal failure: 1.3 despite IVF
s, likely [**1-26**] third spacing of
   fluids with ascites.
   - Monitor creatinine daily
   - Dose meds for GFR
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   # Dyspnea: Resoved. Likely multifactorial given deconditioning,
   ascites, and abdominal pain. S/p peritoneal catheter placement
   # Hyponatremia: Resolved with fluid resuscitation.
   # Decubitus Ulcer: Stage III 1.5 cm decubitus sacral ulcer. Wound care
   are following.
   -Appreciate wound care recs and will follow their instructions.
   # Breast Cancer: Oncology is following and will take her on OMED
   service when she is stable enough to be on the floor.
   - Follow up onc recs
   # Oral thrush:
   - Continue nystatin for thrush and morphine IR for pain control
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 2.6.
   - Continue Levothyroxine

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer admitted to the ICU for dyspnea, tachycardia, hyponatremia, and hypotension. She is currently receiving antibiotics and albumin. The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and acute renal failure. Her blood cultures have been obtained, and she is being treated for SBP. The patient's goals of care have been discussed with the family, and they have agreed to comfort measures with the exception of treatment for SBP. The patient is expected to transition to hospice care.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for SBP and has shown signs of leukocytosis. It is important to monitor her closely for any signs of infection, such as fever or worsening symptoms.

2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage and prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypotension: Despite receiving IV fluids, the patient's blood pressure remains low. It is crucial to continue monitoring her blood pressure and providing adequate fluid resuscitation as needed.

4. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a stage III decubitus ulcer on her sacrum. Proper wound care and pressure relief measures should be implemented to prevent further progression."
