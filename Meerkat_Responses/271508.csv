   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home with cholangitis & sepsis.  She is improved this morning after
   aggressive fluid hydration and antibiotics.
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: The patient looks improved this morning with
   resolving hypotension and tachycardia, decreased white count and
   increased urine output. Her lactate and Cr are improving, anion gap
   decreasing and her metabolic alkalosis appears to have resolved.  She
   is NPO with INR of 1.5 pending ERCP today.
   - Continue Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dosed
   - NPO with IVF titrated to UOP>= 30mL/hr until signs of fluid overload
   on exam
   - PM Hct & Lytes
   - Symptomatic control with Zofran
   - Trending fever curve, white count
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   #. Oliguric renal failure: UOP improving with fluid administration and
   Cr at 1.9 (baseline still unknown).
   - Treat underlying sepsis as above
   - Aggressive volume hydration to goal UOP >= 30mL/hr
   - Renally dose medications/Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. UGIB/Tear: According to recent lavage the patient is not actively
   bleeding, likely has a small tear from vomiting.  Hematocrit has
   decreased signficantly as expected with aggressive hydration

   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.  Delerium seems to have improved.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine)
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day to start [**2116-6-25**]
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV PRN when hemodynamically stable.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily, will return to
   100mcg PO daily once taking POs
   #. CAD: Holding ASA, Statin

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   84 yo F from NH w/ PMH if vascular dementia, recently treated for
   urosepsis admitted with cholangitis.
   Presented after 2 days n/v/abd pain.
   In ed febrile 102, tachy to 114 and transiently hypotensive to 90's
   systolic with fluid response.  94% on 2 L.  LFTs c/w obstructive

   output. Received 4 L IVFs, vanco/levo/flagyl.  NGL for ? coffee ground
   emesis showed no active bleeding.
   Imaging with ruq u/s and ct abd s/o intrahepatic biliary dilatation.
   Surgery and ercp c/s wth plan for ercp in am.

trending down
     * coagulopathy
     * thrombocytopenia
     * anemia
     * leukocytosis--improving
     * G met acidosis
     * Elevated lactate--improving
   Sepsis parameters improving with resolved hypotension and tachycardia
   and increasing urine output after fluids. Lactate, cr, and leukocytosis
   all trending down.  Agree with plan to continue aggressive hydration
   guided by urine output and resp status.  Currently tolerating fluids
   well from resp standpoint.  Continue antibx coverage for GI tract with
   cipro and  flagy. F/u cx results.  NPO for ercp this am. Oliguric ARF
   likely prerenal/sepsis with cr now trending down with hydration.  Will
   renally dose all meds. Continue to trend cr and follow u/o. In terms of
   ? UGIB
NGL neg for active bleeding. HCt drop appears dilutional after
   hydration. Would continue PPI IV while NPO, follow h/h, heme check
   stool and keep t and cross active.
   DNR/DNI, peripheral access adequate at this time.
   Remainder as per resident note
   Critically ill
will remain in ICU post ercp.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of vascular dementia who was admitted to the ICU with cholangitis and sepsis. The patient's current medical issues include sepsis, cholangitis, oliguric renal failure, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, anemia, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels.

The patient presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, tachycardia, and transient hypotension. She was treated with aggressive fluid hydration and antibiotics, which resulted in improved vital signs and laboratory parameters such as decreased white blood cell count, increased urine output, and improving renal function.

The patient's current plan includes continuing aggressive fluid hydration guided by urine output and respiratory status, maintaining antibacterial coverage for the gastrointestinal tract with ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after making the patient NPO (nothing by mouth). The patient will also be monitored for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, given the presence of coffee ground emesis. If active bleeding is suspected, proton pump inhibitor therapy will be continued, and further evaluation will be done.

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and her disposition is pending the results of the ERCP. The patient will remain in the"

1. Cholangitis/Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate an improvement in her condition. However, she may still be at risk for septic shock due to the ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and lab results is essential.

2. Oliguric Renal Failure: The patient has a history of oliguric renal failure, characterized by low urine output. This condition can be exacerbated by sepsis and aggressive fluid hydration. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function tests is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady with dementia presents from [**Location (un) 1075**] [**Hospital1 1657**] Nursing
   home recent nausea and vomiting with a concern for cholangitis based on
   fever, white count and RUQ pain.  On arrival to the floor she appears
   profoundly dry despite aggressive fluid hydration in the ED.
   .
   #. Cholangitis + Sepsis: Given the patient's Fever, WBC count, RUQ
   pain, LFT abnormalities, Imaging her primary process is cholangitis
   stemming from possible gallstones or ? clots based on CT.  Her fever
   curve is trending down with initial antibiotics (Vanc/Levo/Flagyl) and
   her pain is improving.  Recent urosepsis hospital admission with change
   in diet likely contributed to biliary sludging predisposing her to
   cholangitis.  She has [**5-17**] of the [**Last Name (un) 6321**] pentad (unable to assess
   mental status changes without appreciating her baseline).  The
   patient's elevated lactate is attributable to sepsis, and she is
   demonstrating a mixed metabolic acidosis (lactic acidosis) and
   alkalosis from volume contraction.
   - Change Antibiotic coverage to Cipro and Flagyl IV renally dose
   - NPO with aggressive NS boluses and oral care
   - ERCP scheduled for early AM
   - Symptomatic control with Zofran
   - Trending fever curve, white count
   - Hold home antihypertensives
   .
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Current UOP is 125 after 5L of hydration
   with an elevated Cr of 2.4, 1.9 two days prior and baseline unclear.
   - [**Name2 (NI) **] underlying sepsis as above
   - Aggressive volume hydration to goal UOP
   - Renally dose medications/Avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   #. UGIB/Tear: According to recent lavage the patient is not actively
   bleeding, likely has a small tear from vomiting.  Hematocrit stable
   thus far.
   - Convert home Omeprazole to Protonix 40mg IV Q12
   - Repeat Hct Q12 while stable, expecting a drop overnight after fluid
   hydration
   - Guaiac stools
   - Active T&Screen
   - Telemetry
   .
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine)
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO
   .
   #. Hypothyroidism: Continue Levoxyl as 50mcg IV daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old lady with dementia who presented with recent nausea and vomiting. She was admitted to the ICU due to suspected cholangitis, sepsis, and oliguric renal failure. The patient has multiple medical conditions including hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease (CAD), and depression. She is currently being treated with aggressive IVF hydration, antibiotics, and supportive care. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Worsening of cholangitis: The patient's primary process is cholangitis, which is an infection of the bile ducts. If left untreated or inadequately managed, it can lead to further complications such as liver abscesses, septic shock, or even multiorgan failure.
2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's current urine output is low, and her creatinine levels are elevated. If not addressed promptly, this can progress to acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease.
3. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): Although the patient is not actively bleeding at the moment, her history of vomiting and the presence of a small tear raise concerns for potential UGIB. Close monitoring for signs of bleeding and proactive management are crucial.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and RUQ pain suggest an ongoing infection. If not effectively"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of cholangitis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure with stent placement and subsequently required invasive ventilation due to concerns of ""debris"" in the airway. She was kept on vent overnight and switched from pressure support ventilation (PSV) to volume control (VC) as she was tachypneic, but then switched back to PSV in the morning.

The patient has no known drug allergies and received antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam. She is currently receiving propofol infusion and pantoprazole (Protonix).

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature range of 36.8 to 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 84 and 117 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 to 174/82 mmHg, respiratory rate between 20 and 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 400 mL, spontaneous tidal volume of 360 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old lady with a history of cholangitis who underwent an ERCP procedure. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has multiple medical conditions including dementia, depression, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, coronary artery disease, and renal failure. She is also experiencing oliguria, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and has undergone stent placement in her common bile duct due to obstruction caused by stones. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to prolonged intubation and invasive ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's risk factors include being on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, which increases the likelihood of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility can lead to pressure ulcers.
5. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immune system may be compromised, increasing the risk of nosocomial infections.
6. Delirium: Due to the patient's age and multiple comorbidities, there is a risk of developing delirium.
7. Renal failure: The patient already has oliguric renal failure, and it may worsen due to decreased kidney function"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.
   .
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.
   .
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Holding Statin while NPO

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with suspected cholangitis. He was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and was advanced to a regular diet. Blood cultures revealed growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative rods. The patient's code status has been changed from DNR/DNI to DNR only. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 149/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.17. Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and elevated Cr levels. The patient has a history of cholangitis and is currently being managed in the ICU with appropriate antibiotics, pain management, and glycemic control. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor once stabilized.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:

1. Infection: The patient's blood cultures growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Gram-negative rods indicate a possible infection. This could lead to sepsis or septic shock if not properly managed.

2. Organ dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests possible kidney dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function"

   An 84 year old lady admitted with cholangitis now s/p ERCP and
   intubation with positive blood cultures (Psuedomonas by verbal
   report).  She was successfully extubated but appears to be volume
   overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.
   #. Pseudomonal Bacteremia:  Per verbal report from microbiology, the
   patient
s GNR bacteremia (2 bottles on [**6-23**]) is pseduomonas,
   sensitivites pending.  She continues to have an elevated white count
   but is afebrile and otherwise hemodynamically stable.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn x2 week course.  Narrow (or broaden) based on
   returning microbiology.
   - Daily blood cultures for surveillance
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   - F/U ERCP Recs re: diet
   - Continue Abx as above
   - pain control with Morphine IV
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s AM labs contained numerous
   abnormalities, significant enough to suggest they are not accurate.
   However, her thrombocytopenia is significantly concerning for DIC given
   sepsis.
   - Repeat CBC with fibrinogen & coags
   - Transfuse Cryoprecipitate for fibrinogen <100
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~50/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Patient reportedly at baseline but will confirm with
   family in AM.  Depression component, holding Celexa & Clonazepam while
   NPO.
   .
   #. HTN: Patient currently normotensive, holding home anti-hypertensives
   (Labetalol, Captopril, Amlodipine) in the setting of recent sepsis.

   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO every other
   day.

   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.  Consider
   Morphine IV when hemodynamically stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old lady admitted with cholangitis. She underwent an ERCP procedure and intubation due to positive blood cultures showing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient was successfully extubated but appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation. She has an elevated white blood cell count but is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. She continues to receive antibiotics (Cipro/Zosyn) for pseudomonal bacteremia, and sensitivities are pending. Blood cultures for surveillance are being taken daily. The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement, draining black bile and pus. Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks is recommended. The patient's platelet count is low, which is concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) given her sepsis. A repeat CBC with fibrinogen and coagulation studies should be done, and cryoprecipitate may be transfused for fibrinogen levels below 100. The patient is oliguric with improving creatinine levels and has been autodiurese. She is currently fluid overloaded, so fluid restriction is advised. The patient's mental status is unchanged from admission, but further evaluation is needed to confirm. Other medical conditions such as hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease are being managed accordingly. The patient's code status is D"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, an 84-year-old lady, was admitted with cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure. She was intubated due to respiratory distress but has now been successfully extubated. The patient has positive blood cultures for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram-positive cocci. She appears to be volume overloaded after aggressive resuscitation.

Medical Complications:

1. Pseudomonal Bacteremia/GPC Bacteremia: The patient is currently being treated with ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), in addition to vancomycin. This is because she has a positive blood culture for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

2. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement, which drained black bile and pus. A repeat ERCP is scheduled in 6 weeks.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low but stable. Fibrinogen levels are normal, and the INR is within normal range.

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
   Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout
   the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix,
   unless there is an acute change in fluid status.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Reintroducing Labetalol 200mg
   PO BID today. Continue to hold Captopril and Amlodipine.
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: Will restart statin

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of cholangitis, subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia, and respiratory distress. She has been intubated and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Gram-positive cocci. She is being treated with Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin. Her respiratory distress requires supplemental oxygen provided by a shovel mask. She has started to increase her urine output, and fluid overload is a concern. The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement draining black bile and pus. Her platelets have dropped from 118 to 86, raising concerns about the accuracy of her labs due to difficult venous access. Her creatinine levels are improving, and she is now oliguric with a urine output of 80-100/hr. She is also hypertensive and has various other medical conditions such as dementia, gout, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, CAD, and spinal stenosis. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is possible callout tomorrow.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Gram-positive cocci. She is already receiving treatment with Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin, which should provide coverage for all the organisms. However"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 6451**] has remained extubated without difficulty. She has had
   minimal PO intake and denies dyspnea.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with edema Tm of 98.9 BP 140/50 HRof 88 RR
   of 18 with sats of 97% on 2 lpm . There is dullness to percussion at
   bases but no evidence for wheeze.
   Labs notable for WBC 13.5 K, HCT  31.9, K+ 3.3, Cr 1.2 , alb of 2.6,
   plts of 54K  CXR with large bilateral effusions and small lung
   volumes .
   Agree with plan to continue broad Antibiotics pending sensitivities of
   GNR/ GPC's in blood. She will need gentle diuresis over next few  days
   to help with anasarca. suspect thrombocytopenia is drug related ( ? PPI
   vs Vanco).  We will follow off these medications.after PICC placement
   she will transition to medical floor for further care. Will need to
   speak wih guardian/ HCP regarding overall goals of care.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is slowly improving.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old lady with a history of cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia post ERCP and intubation. She is currently in the ICU and has been doing well but still requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC, and GNRs. She is being treated with Cipro/Zosyn and Vancomycin to cover all the organisms. The patient has experienced an unexplained drop in hemoglobin levels, and anemia studies are pending. She has also had a decrease in platelet count from 118 to 54. There is a concern for medication-related thrombocytopenia, possibly due to PPI or Vancomycin. The patient's renal function is improving, and her urine output is good. She has a history of several medical conditions including dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for multiple bacteria, indicating a potential ongoing infection. The choice of antibiotics needs to be monitored and adjusted based on the sensitivity results.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air, suggesting that she may have fluid overload or another respiratory issue. Monitoring I/Os and performing a chest X-ray are recommended to evaluate her respiratory status."

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and GPC.  She remains afebrile with a
   constant elevated WBC count.  Her current regimen of Cipro/Zosyn with
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient still requires supplemental oxygen
   provided by shovel mask.  Her recent CXR and exam suggest that she has
   fluid overload. She has begun to increase her  urine output and we will
   allow her to autodiurese with a goal of 1L today.  If not achieved, we
   will add lasix.
   - Monitor I/Os
   - ABG today to evaluate oxygenation
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.  Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks. Advance
   diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86, Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  There is a concern for the accuracy of
   her labs given her difficult venous access.
   - Repeat labs today with Arterial blood gas
   #. Oliguric renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is ~80-100/hr.
    Patient is in fact now fluid overloaded.  We will give her throughout

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old lady who was admitted to the ICU for cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia following an ERCP procedure. She remains on supplemental oxygen provided by a nasal cannula. Her recent chest X-ray suggests fluid overload, but she has started to increase her urine output. She is being allowed to autodiurese with a goal of 1 liter today, and lasix will be added if not achieved. 

The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and GPC. She is currently on a regimen of Ciprofloxacin/Zosyn with Vancomycin added this morning, which should provide coverage for all her organisms. 

Her platelet count has dropped from 118 to 86, and there is a concern for the accuracy of her labs due to difficult venous access. Repeat labs today with arterial blood gas are planned. 

Her creatinine level is improving, and her urine output is approximately 80-100/hr. However, she is now fluid overloaded. She will be given fluids throughout the day to mobilize fluid and autodiurese before administering lasix, unless there is an acute change in fluid status. 

The patient has several comorbidities including dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and CAD. Her code status is DNR (do not resuscitate),"

   Assessment and Plan
   An 84 year old lady cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia
   s/p ERCP and intubation.  She is doing well today but has a continued
   oxygen requirement.
   #. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient
s blood cultures are positive
   for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC and GNRs.  She remains afebrile
   with a constant elevated WBC count. She is currently on Cipro/Zosyn and
   Vancomycin added this morning should provide coverage for all of her
   organisms.
   - Continue Cipro/Zosyn for total two week dose
   - Vanc 1g first dose today, Q48 ongoing for 2 weeks
   - f/u cultures/speciation/sensitivities and adjust ABX as needed.
   -PICC placement this AM
   #. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air.  Her
   recent CXR and exam suggest that she has fluid overload. She has been
   autodiuresing well above goal of 1L.  Lasix not indicated at this time.
   - Monitor I/Os
   -goal UOP is -1L
   -CXR today
   .
   #. s/p ERCP: The patient had a successful ERCP with stent placement
   draining black bile and pus draining.
   -Repeat ERCP in 6 weeks.
   -Advance diet as tolerated.
   #. Thrombocytopenia:  The patient
s platelets have again dropped from
   118>86 and now to 54.  No heparin products. Fibrinogen, INR wnl.  The
   most likely cause is medication related and due to PPI or Vanco.  Given
   that the patient is not bleeding, requires Vanco for GPCs, will monitor
   and consider d/c meds as indicated.
   - follow platelets and transfuse for <10 or signs of bleeding.
   #. Acute renal failure: Cr improving and current UOP is >100/hr.
   #. Dementia: Overreported, patient is at baseline and doing well.
   #. HTN: Patient currently hypertensive.  Yesterday started Labetalol
   200mg PO BID, still hypertensive will restart Amlodipine today and
   continue to hold Captopril..
   #. Gout: Continuing Allopurinol, renally dosed at 100mg PO daily
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue Lidoderm patch, hold Vicodin.
   #. Hyperlipidemia: continue statin.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of cholangitis and subsequent polymicrobial bacteremia post ERCP and intubation. She is currently on antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) and has shown improvement in her condition. The patient has respiratory distress and fluid overload, which may be contributing to her oxygen requirement. Thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure are also present, with the platelet count dropping from 118 to 54. Other medical conditions include dementia, hypertension, gout, spinal stenosis, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and coronary artery disease. The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status and is scheduled for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Polymicrobial Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures are positive for Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, GPC, and GNRs. This infection needs to be closely monitored, and antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture and sensitivity results.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is not stable on room air, indicating possible respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. A chest X-ray has been ordered to assess for fluid overload.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped significantly, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring of plate"
