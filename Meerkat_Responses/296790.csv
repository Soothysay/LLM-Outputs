   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOGLYCEMIA
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this) --> will give 1 L NS at 300 cc/hr for now while waiting
   for HD
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --???will reoffer NG tube for bowel decompression given high pitched
   bowel sounds
   --???concern DIC, given decr Hct, plt, higher FDP, rising INR (but
   elevated fibrinogen)
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control --> if remains hypertensive, will consider
   labetolol IV (posibly drip)
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- patient with foley in overnight, but remove as soon as clinically
   able to decrease risk of UTI
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- may have to place NG tube for abd distention today (son coming in
   this afternoon, will discuss)
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes, NPO for now, hold IVF for now (consider IVF if BP
   decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, anemia, and seasonal allergies. The patient is currently in the ICU for acute pancreatitis, likely due to medication augmentation, as well as hypoglycemia, pain control, and fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with no prior history of pancreatitis. The cause of pancreatitis is unclear, possibly from the medication augmentin. Pain control with IV morphine is being provided, and the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth). It is important to monitor calcium levels closely and consider an MRCP if not improving.

2. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure ranging from 200-220 systolic. This could be related to pain from pancreatitis or fluid administration. The patient's home medications for hypertension include imdur, metoprolol, and nortriptyline. Pain control measures should be addressed, and if the patient remains hypertensive, labetalol IV may be considered.

3. ESRD on HD: The patient is on hemodialysis three times a week at Hospital1 and followed by Dr. [Last Name]. He has a right arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and was recently hemodialyzed on [1-8]. The patient received approximately 3 liters of fluid on [1-8], normal saline. Renal recommendations should be followed, and IV fluids should be held as the patient is not hypotensive and shows crackles on pulmonary examination.

4. AFIB: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in sinus rhythm. His INR is slightly subtherapeutic at 1.6 in the emergency department, but now therapeutic. The patient will continue on coumadin, and daily INR monitoring will be done.

5. DMII: The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is controlled with insulin at home. QID finger sticks will be continued, and the patient will remain on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding scale.

6. Frequent UTIs: The patient has known frequent urinary tract infections and recently started on macrodantin 100mg QHS for prophylaxis. However, augmentin was recently started for UCx and may increase the risk of UTIs. The patient will be switched to ceftriaxone 1g IV QD x 7 days based on previous sensitivities.

7. Anemia: The patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely due to hemoconcentration. There is no evidence of active bleeding from the GI tract, but the patient reported some trace hematemesis. An NG tube may be placed for abdominal distention today.

8. History of TIA/CVA:"

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not

   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 7 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiaic stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), NPO for now, hold IVF for now
   (consider IVF if BP decreases).
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch
   .

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely (Ca corrects to 8.2 this AM; gave 1g IV this AM
   to replete)
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, so not significant concern; believe INR still
   rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check peripheral smear today, check pm
   CBC and coags; continues to be thrombocytopenic
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - continue vancomycin (day #1 = [**1-9**])
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs; no HD planned for today
   -- hold on IVF today as not hypotensive and crackles here on pulmonary
   exam
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, DMII, AFIB, anemia, TIA/CVA, seasonal allergies, hypercholesterolemia, and frequent UTIs. He presented with acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to augmentin use, and is currently experiencing delirium, hypoglycemia, pain, confusion, hypertension, fever, and renal failure. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is on various medications.

Potential medical complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as infection, necrosis, pseudocyst formation, and pancreatic fistula.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of recurrent hypoglycemia due to insulin administration and NPO status.
3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can progress to severe confusion and agitation. It is important to manage pain, maintain hydration, and provide frequent reorientation.
4. Hypertension: The patient has elevated blood pressure, which needs to be controlled to prevent further complications such as heart attack or stroke.
5. Fever: The patient's fever could indicate an ongoing infection, which requires further investigation and appropriate antibiotic treatment.
6. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and close monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and medication dosages is necessary.

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- c/s surgery re: evaluation for potential surgery once acute
   inflammation settles
   -- NPO
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca closely
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- concern for DIC with thrombocytopenia (but elevated fibrinogen, and
   Hct still above baseline, and without DIC evidence on peripheral smear;
   believe INR still rising d/t coumadin and ESRD); check pm CBC and coags
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u repeat smear as outpatient
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - continue vancomycin (day #1 = [**1-9**])
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- continue sevelamer  w/ meals once taking PO's
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note

   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of ESRD on HD, diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and hypercholesterolemia. The patient was admitted to the ICU for acute pancreatitis and has several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is showing signs of delirium or confusion, which can be common in elderly patients in the ICU setting.

2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are low, and there is a concern for hypoglycemia, especially since the patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and has been receiving insulin.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. The patient's electrolyte levels need to be closely monitored.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Pain control is a priority, and the patient may require surgery once the acute inflammation settles. Monitoring of calcium levels is also important.

5. Fever: The patient's temperature has spiked, and there is concern for infection, possibly pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or inflammation.

6. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and it may be related to pain from pancreatitis or fluid administration. The patient's home medications for hypertension should be continued.

   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- change NPO to clear liquid diet and advance as tolerated
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation
 f/u with PCP
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp o/n (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement).
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinue vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   - CXR at 10am tomorrow morning
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   -- note BP cuff has been on leg

   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- restart sevelamer  w/ meals now that trying PO
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   therapeutic.
   - continue coumadin; hold today
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   -- f/u urine culture

   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), clear liquid diet with advance
   as tolerated, hold IVF for now, getting HD.
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin;

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including diabetes mellitus type II, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, and a history of anemia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to augmentation, as well as delirium/confusion, hypoglycemia, and renal failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as necrosis, infection, pseudocyst formation, or even pancreatic ductal obstruction.
2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing delirium, which can be common in elderly patients in the ICU setting. This may progress to worsening confusion and could potentially lead to falls, injuries, or other complications.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient is at risk of recurrent hypoglycemia due to his diabetes mellitus type II and recent insulin administration in the setting of end-stage renal disease. Hypoglycemia can cause seizures, altered mental status, or even coma.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal function or complications related to the hemodialysis process itself.
5. Infection: The patient has a fever, which could indicate an underlying infection"

The patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset of nausea, vomiting, and confusion. On admission, the patient was found to have a temperature of 38.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 140 beats per minute, blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, and platelet count. The blood cultures are pending, but the urine culture revealed the presence of yeast. The patient's liver function tests are improving, but his serum amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated, suggestive of acute pancreatitis. The abdominal examination reveals tenderness and guarding.

The patient's chest X-ray shows mild bilateral hilar engorgement, perihilar vascular engorgement, indistinctness of the perihilar vessels, bibasilar opacities, and small bilateral pleural effusion. These findings are consistent with mild volume overload.

   Blood cultures pending.
   CXR [**1-10**]:
   The patient continues to be in mild volume overload giving the
   bilateral hilar
   engorgement and perihilar vascular engorgement as well as
   indistinctness of
   the perihilar vessels. The degree of the vascular engorgement/pulmonary
   edema
   is unchanged, mild. Bibasilar opacities are present but overall, there
   is
   improved aeration of the lung bases. Small bilateral pleural effusion
   is
   unchanged. There are no new focal consolidations, but the left
   retrocardiac
   opacity might represent a combination of atelectasis and infection.
   CXR from this AM not performed yet.

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 RENAL FAILURE, END STAGE (END STAGE RENAL DISEASE, ESRD)
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   #. PANCREATITIS: acute with no h/o pancreatitis per son, reportedly no
   EtOH, nml TG; slight effusion and volume depletion likely related; Ca
   normal now though a little lower than last night; in considerable
   pain.  Appears volume depleted per labs with hemoconcentration, though
   is hypertensive (got 2L in ED, 125cc/hr overnight).  Unclear cause--
   possibly from augmentin which was started 2 days prior to sx though not
   highly associated with pancreatitis (though is a/w cholestatic
   jaundice)
   -- pain control with IV morphine PRN and standing Tylenol
   -- setup outpatient appointment to evaluate for potential surgery once
   acute inflammation settles
   -- continue to advance diet as tolerated
   -- would be helpful to know baseline dry weight from HD center (renal
   may have this)
   -- monitor Ca daily
   -- zofran and compazine PRN
   -- trend LFTs; consider MRCP if not improving
   --hold on NG tube for bowel decompression given concern for delirium
   and symptomatically improving
   -- check daily CBC and coags (decr. concern for DIC now)
   -- given dysplasia on peripheral smear, f/u CBC as outpatient s/p acute
   inflammation
 f/u with PCP
   .
   #. FEVER: Spiked temp yesterday (pancreatitis versus PNA versus urinary
   versus s/p PICC placement). Afebrile last 24 hours.
   - f/u cultures (blood and urine)
   - discontinued vancomycin
   - monitor fever curve
   - f/u CXR from this morning
   .
   #. Afib with RVR: Patient into afib with RVR to 140s, non-responsive to
   metoprolol, now on dilt gtt.
   - Start diltiazem 30mg qid and wean down dilt gtt as tolerated
   .
   # AFIB: Patient with h/o afib on coumadin. INR slightly subtherapeutic
   at 1.6 in ED. Patient currently sinus rhythm, BP controlled. Now INR
   supratherapeutic.
   - continue coumadin; hold today again
   - can stop SQH now that therapeutic
   - follow daily INR
   - continue home dose of metoprolol with IV doses if needed
   .
   #. HYPERTENSION: Patient with elevated BP into 200-220s SBP in context
   of pain with pancreatitis and also with fluid administration though not
   obviously volume overloaded. At home was on imdur, metoprolol, and
   norvasc.
   -- cont home meds
   -- address pain control
   -- will avoid lowering too aggressively given concern for potential
   hypotension in setting of pancreatitis
   -- note BP cuff has been on leg
   .
   # ESRD on HD: Patient M,W,F HD usually at [**Hospital1 475**], followed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1362**].
   Has R AVF. S/p HD on [**1-8**]. Given ~3L of fluid on [**1-8**], NS.
   -- f/u renal recs
   -- HD today
   -- restart sevelamer  w/ meals now that trying PO
   .
   # DMII: Controlled on insulin at home
   - QID finger sticks
   - Continue patient on NPH 15 units daily and humalog insulin sliding
   scale  - with hold parameters, and give D50 as needed for hypoglycemia
   (hypoglycemia perhaps due to NPO as well as prior insulin
   administration in setting of ESRD)
   .
   # Confusion: More fearful and confused than yesterday
 concern
   delirium in elderly in ICU setting.
   - pain control (standing Tylenol to avoid opiates as much as possible
   yet still with adequate pain relief)
   - consider haldol or seroquel or zyprexa (keep in mind elderly and
   renal failure) prn if worsens
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   # Frequent urinary tract infections: Patient with know frequent UTIs
   recently started on Macrodantin 100mg QHS for ppx. Reportedly was
   started on augmentin three days ago for UCx + on [**12-28**], though no note
   yet in OMR.
   -- Will avoid augmentin given risk of cholestatic jaundice with current
   LFT's
   -- [**12-28**] showed sensitivities to ceftriaxone --> will write for
   ceftriaxone 1 g IV QD x 10 days
   -- f/u UCx from admission, though will be difficult to interpret in
   setting of recent abx
   -- d/c Foley on [**1-9**]
   -- f/u urine culture
   .
   #. History of Anemia. Patient's Hct is up from baseline, likely [**2-28**]
   hemoconcentration. Patient without evidence of active bleeding from GI
   tract, however did note some trace hematemesis, declined NGT in ED.
   -- hold on NGT placement
   -- cont trending Hct
   -- no need for guiac stools given recent GIB hx; monitor for gross
   blood loss
   .
   # h/o TIA/CVA: No acute concerns or neuro deficits.
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - hold home atorvastatin with elevated LFT's (for now).
   .
   # Seasonal Allergies:
   - continue on home fluticasone.
   .
   # FEN: Replete lytes (pm lytes check), clear liquid diet with advance
   as tolerated, hold IVF for now, getting HD.
   # Prophylaxis:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin being held as INR therapeutic on warfarin;
   hold warfarin today
   -Bowel regimen with senna, colace, dulcolax with narcotics
   -Pain management with IV morphine, standing tylenol, lidocaine patch

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently on Coumadin. The patient's blood pressure has been elevated, ranging from 200-220s SBP. The patient has been experiencing nausea, vomiting, delirium, confusion, and pain related to acute pancreatitis. The patient also has end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is on hemodialysis. The patient has diabetes mellitus type II, controlled with insulin. The patient has a history of anemia, and their Hct is up from baseline, likely due to hemoconcentration. The patient has a history of frequent urinary tract infections and was recently started on augmentin, which may contribute to the development of acute pancreatitis. 

The patient's current medications include Coumadin, metoprolol, norvasc, NPH, humalog insulin sliding scale, senna, colace, dulcolax, narcotics, and sevelamer. The patient's allergies include seasonal allergies, and they are sensitive to ceftriaxone.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, low magnesium, and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST). The urine culture shows yeast infection with 10,000-100,000 organisms/ml.

The patient's imaging reveals mild volume overload with bilateral hilar engorgement,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis in the MICU. She has pancreatitis and hypertension. Her pancreatitis has improved, and she is tolerating diet advancement. Her hypertension is being managed with medications such as Cont Imdur, metoprolol, and Norvasc. Her atrial fibrillation (Afib) rate is currently controlled, but her INR is high, so Coumadin is being held. She has chronic renal failure and requires hemodialysis. Her thrombocytopenia is stable. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is being treated with antibiotics for 10 days. Other issues are managed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, or infected pancreatic necrosis.
2. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension can result in complications such as stroke, heart attack, or kidney damage.
3. Atrial fibrillation: If not adequately managed, atrial fibrillation can lead to complications like stroke or heart failure.
4. Chronic renal failure: End-stage renal disease can progress to complete kidney failure, requiring lifelong dialysis or kidney transplantation.
5. Thrombocytopenia: Low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding and bruising.
6. UTI: If not properly"
