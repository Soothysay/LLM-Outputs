   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 837**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is hypoxic with pao2 of 85 in spite
   of FIO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5.  Hypoxic respiratory failure is
   multifactorial secondary to pneumonia, TBM, and possible PE.  On
   Vanco/Levo/Zosyn at OSH for pneumonia, now day ?5.  Will continue with
   Vanco/Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia (patient was a resident at
   rehab).  Sputum cultures at OSH positive for MRSA only. Stent migration
   with distal airway collapse also likely contributing to respiratory
   failure.  Awaiting stent removal and Y-stent placement in OR tomorrow
   morning.  Patient also found to have elevated PA pressure on echo,
   though unchanged from 2 weeks prior, concerning for PE.  Patient
   underwent CTA this evening, but results are pending.   Will hold on
   heparin drip given that he is awaiting surgery in AM and will resume
   heparin if CTA is positive.
   - f/u CTA from OSH
   - continue vanco/zosyn for PNA
   - NPO after midnight for stent removal and placement
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient hypotensive with leukocytosis and pneumonia
   concerning for sepsis.  However, appears dehydrated on exam and CVP is
   low ([**4-16**]).  Will bolus patient to raise CVP to [**7-23**] and aim to titrate
   down levophed.
   - IVF boluses to maintain CVP > 8
   - wean levophed
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/zosyn for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Volume status.  Patient appears dehydrated and has low CVP.
   - IVF bolus PRN to maintain CVP >8
   .
   4.  Eosinphilia.  On vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug
   rash at present.  No clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.
   - monitor CBC with Diff
   - clarify with [**Hospital1 **] if patient previously had eosinphilia or drug rash
   .
   5.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   .
   Ppx: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.
   NPO until surgery, then will resume tube feeds.

","Summary:
- Patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis.
- He was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving antibiotics (Vanco/Levo/Zosyn) for pneumonia, and has an elevated PA pressure indicating possible pulmonary embolism (PE).
- A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, but the results are pending.
- The patient's CVP is low, suggesting dehydration, and he is hypotensive. Levophed is being weaned slowly.
- Eosinophilia is present, but no clear etiology has been identified.
- The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, with creatinine levels at baseline.
- The plan includes removing the tracheal stent and placing a Y-stent, continuing antibiotics, and monitoring for sepsis, dehydration, and respiratory failure.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including pneumonia, tracheal stent migration, and possible PE. Further deterioration in oxygenation or respiratory function could occur if the current issues are not addressed effectively.

2. Sepsis: The patient is hypotensive with leukocytosis and pneumonia, which raises concerns for sepsis. If the infection is not adequately controlled, the patient may develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Name14 (STitle) 837**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Patient is hypoxic with pao2 of 85 in spite
   of FIO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5.  Hypoxic respiratory failure is
   multifactorial secondary to pneumonia, TBM, and possible PE.  On
   Vanco/Levo/Zosyn at OSH for pneumonia, now day ?5.  Will continue with
   Vanco/Zosyn for hospital acquired pneumonia (patient was a resident at
   rehab).  Sputum cultures at OSH positive for MRSA only. Stent migration
   with distal airway collapse also likely contributing to respiratory
   failure.  Awaiting stent removal and Y-stent placement in OR tomorrow
   morning.  Patient also found to have elevated PA pressure on echo,
   though unchanged from 2 weeks prior, concerning for PE.  Patient
   underwent CTA this evening, but results are pending.   Will hold on
   heparin drip given that he is awaiting surgery in AM and will resume
   heparin if CTA is positive.
   - f/u CTA from OSH
   - continue vanco/zosyn for PNA
   - NPO after midnight for stent removal and placement
   - f/u sputum cultures, blood cultures
   - trend fever curve, wbc
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient hypotensive with leukocytosis and pneumonia
   concerning for sepsis.  However, appears dehydrated on exam and CVP is
   low ([**4-16**]).  Will bolus patient to raise CVP to [**7-23**] and aim to titrate
   down levophed.
   - IVF boluses to maintain CVP > 8
   - wean levophed
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/zosyn for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Volume status.  Patient appears dehydrated and has low CVP.
   - IVF bolus PRN to maintain CVP >8
   .
   4.  Eosinphilia.  On vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug
   rash at present.  No clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.
   - monitor CBC with Diff
   - clarify with [**Hospital1 **] if patient previously had eosinphilia or drug rash
   .
   5.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   .
   Ppx: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.
   NPO until surgery, then will resume tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculous meningitis.
- He was admitted with respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
- The patient is currently on vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia.
- His current vital signs show hypoxia with a PaO2 of 85 despite being on FIO2 of 60% and PEEP of 5.
- The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, secondary to pneumonia, TBM, and possible pulmonary embolism.
- He has elevated PA pressure on echo, which is concerning for PE.
- The patient underwent a CTA this evening, but the results are pending.
- His blood cultures at OSH were positive for MRSA only.
- Stent migration with distal airway collapse is also likely contributing to respiratory failure.
- The plan is to remove the stent and place a Y-stent in the OR tomorrow morning.
- The patient is awaiting surgery, so the heparin drip has been held.
- If the CTA is positive, the heparin drip will be resumed.
- The patient's hypotension may be due to dehydration or sepsis.
- The CVP is low, and IVF boluses will be given to maintain CVP > 8.
- Levophed will be weaned down as tolerated.
- The patient appears dehydrated and has a low CVP.
- IVF bolus will be given PRN to maintain CVP > 8.
- The patient has eosinophilia, but no clear etiology has been identified.
- The patient's creatinine is at baseline.
- The patient is NPO until surgery, then tube feeds will be resumed.
- The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, secondary to pneumonia, TBM, and possible PE. The stent migration with distal airway collapse may also contribute to respiratory failure. The patient's hypoxia is concerning and requires immediate attention.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of sepsis, especially considering his pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and trend fever curve is essential.
3. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's elevated PA pressure on echo and the presence of risk factors such as immobility and central venous catheters raise concern for pulmonary embolism. The pending CTA results will provide further information.
4. Dehydration: The patient appears dehydrated on examination, and his low CVP supports this assessment. IVF boluses will be given to maintain CVP > 8, and fluid status will be closely monitored.
5. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, but no clear etiology has been identified. Monitoring CBC with Diff and clarifying any previous history of eosinophilia or drug rash is important.
6. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's creatinine is at baseline, indicating that his renal function is stable at the moment. However, careful monitoring of renal function is crucial in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
7. Tracheal Stent Removal: The planned removal of the tracheal stent and placement of a Y-stent in the OR tomorrow morning carries its own risks and complications, such as bleeding, infection, and airway complications. Close monitoring during the procedure is necessary."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 87-year-old male with hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis who was admitted with respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The stent has been removed, and there are still copious thick secretions.

2. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). However, due to eosinophilia, the antibiotic regimen has been changed to ceftazidime.

3. The patient's blood pressure is low, and there is concern for sepsis. Efforts are being made to maintain a central venous pressure (CVP) above 8 through IV fluid boluses, weaning off levophed (norepinephrine), holding home antihypertensive medications, and continuing vancomycin and ceftazidime for pneumonia.

4. The patient's eosinophilia is being monitored, as no clear etiology has been identified. Vancomycin and Zosyn have been discontinued, and ceftazidime has been started.

5. The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is stable, with creatinine levels within baseline range.

6. The patient's code status is full code, and the health care proxy is [**Name2 (NI) 838**].

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. While the stent has been removed, the presence of copious thick secretions may continue to pose a risk for respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure and the presence of pneumonia suggest a risk for sepsis. Close monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension requires careful management, including IV fluid boluses and weaning off levophed. If not properly managed, it could lead to organ hypoperfusion and potential organ damage.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient's eosinophilia has not been fully explained. Monitoring the CBC with diff and considering alternative causes or drug reactions is important to prevent complications related to eosinophilia.

5. Chronic renal insufficiency: Although the patient's creatinine levels are within baseline range, ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary to ensure that any potential complications related to chronic renal insufficiency are identified early.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include but are not limited to:
1. Infection: The patient has received multiple antibiotics, and blood and sputum cultures were taken, indicating a concern for infection. The elevated white blood cell count also supports this possibility.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which may be necessary due to respiratory failure or other respiratory complications. Close monitoring of the patient's oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
3. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure fluctuates throughout the day, and they are receiving vasopressor support with norepinephrine. This suggests potential hemodynamic instability and the need for careful monitoring and management.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Secretions are
   improved.  Patient initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing
   FIO2 requirements, so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Cultures
   here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and WBC
   trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 6 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement
   - wean FIO2 today
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient hypotensive with pneumonia concerning for
   sepsis.  Now improved with aggressive fluids.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF boluses to maintain CVP > 8
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tracheobronchomalacia. He was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient has been on Vancomycin (Vanco) and Ceftriaxone (Ceftaz) antibiotics. 

24-hour events include the removal of the stent by the patient in the operating room, a change in antibiotics due to concern for eosinophilia, and obtaining the patient's medical history from a previous hospital. The patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, receiving Fentanyl and Midazolam infusions for sedation and pain control. Other ICU medications include Lansoprazole, Heparin sodium, Ceftriaxone, Atrovent, Albuterol, and Colace.

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/51 mmHg to 130/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis who was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient underwent removal of the tracheal stent and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. He is also being managed for hypotension, eosinophilia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient's current vital signs are stable, but he remains on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure due to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. While the stent has been removed, there is still a risk of continued respiratory distress or infection.

2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension could be a sign of sepsis, especially in the context of pneumonia. Close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be crucial to prevent further deterioration.

3. Eosinophilia: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count, which may be a response to medication or an underlying allergic reaction. Monitoring the CBC with Diff and considering alternative antibiotics may be necessary to address this issue.

4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency: The patient's baseline creatinine levels are within the normal range, but there is a risk of worsening renal function due to ongoing infections and other factors. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of medications accordingly will be important."

","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to tachypnea and hypoxia, indicating difficulty breathing on their own. They were unable to have a nasogastric tube (NGT) placed. 

The patient has been receiving various antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Cefepime, Vancomycin, and Ceftazidime. They are also on infusions of Fentanyl and Midazolam for pain and sedation, respectively. 

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side. Their heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. Their oxygen saturation is at 99%, indicating good oxygenation. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,152 mL and output of 2,800 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,648 mL, which may indicate some fluid loss. 

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 11 cmH2O. Their fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is set at 50%. 

The physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, cardiovascular system, or abdomen. However, breath sounds are rhonchorous diffusely, suggesting the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Secretions are
   improved.  Patient initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing
   FIO2 requirements, so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Cultures
   here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and WBC
   trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 6 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement
   - wean FIO2 today
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  Patient hypotensive with pneumonia concerning for
   sepsis.  Now improved with aggressive fluids.  Now off pressors.
   - IVF boluses to maintain CVP > 8
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP

   3.  Eosinphilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinphilia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient has been placed on vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics. Initially, the patient was doing well on spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), but required increasing FiO2 requirements, suggesting the need for positive pressure due to tuberculosis (TBM). Cultures are negative, but from outside source, positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Fever and white blood cell count are trending down with ongoing antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to pneumonia and migration of tracheal stent (post-obstructive pneumonia). The stent has been removed, and secretions have improved. The patient may need positive pressure due to TBM. Cultures are negative, but from an outside source, positive for MRSA.
2. Hypotension with pneumonia concerning for sepsis. Now improved with aggressive fluids and off pressors.
3. Eosinophilia. The patient had eosinophilia at outside source on vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin. No evidence of drug rash at present. No clear etiology of eosinophilia at present. Zosyn was switched to ceftazidime given eosinophilia.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Continued to have
   secretions and now with infiltrate on right lower lung.  Patient
   initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing FIO2 requirements,
   so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Now hypoxic today likely
   secondary to secretions; no fever or WBC to suggest worsening PNA.
   Cultures here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and
   WBC trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 9 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement, hopefully on monday
   - wean FIO2 today
   - trial of extubation ?tomorrow if hypoxia resolves and Y-stent can be
   placed
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid recussitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinphilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinphilia and eosinophilia is mildy improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of Tuberculosis (TBM) and migrated tracheal stent. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and post-obstructive MRSA pneumonia. The patient underwent stent removal and has been intubated.

24-hour events include starting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for one hour, but it was unsuccessful as the patient increased secretions and had a low oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 91% on 50% FiO2. The patient is unable to provide history due to being intubated.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Cefipime, Ceftazidime, and Vancomycin.

Infusions include Fentanyl and Midazolam for sedation. Other ICU medications include Heparin Sodium for prophylaxis, colace, FeSO4, Prevacid, peridex, and heparin subcutaneously three times a day.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the respiratory issues mentioned earlier.

Vital signs show the patient's temperature is 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate is 108 bpm with a baseline of 74-115 bpm, blood pressure ranges from 89/47 mmHg to 137/76 mmHg, respiratory rate is 26 breaths per minute with a baseline of 18"

   Assessment and Plan
   Overall obstacles to extubation include TBM, worsened RLL opacity and
   FIO2 requirement. He appears to be dependent on PEEP to clear his
   secretions. Fluid balance even for length of stay.
   RESP:
   1) Discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 901**].  Given his dependence of PEEP is an
   obstacle to weaning he will go for stent placement tomorrow.  Plan for
   trial of extubation thereafter.
   2) Will continue bronchodilators and suctioning
   3) TBB even to negative 500.
   GI:
   1) resume tube feeds

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Continued to have
   secretions and now with infiltrate on right lower lung.  Patient
   initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing FIO2 requirements,
   so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Now hypoxic today likely
   secondary to secretions; no fever or WBC to suggest worsening PNA.
   Cultures here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and
   WBC trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 9 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement, hopefully on monday
   - wean FIO2 today
   - trial of extubation ?tomorrow if hypoxia resolves and Y-stent can be
   placed
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid recussitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinphilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinphilia and eosinophilia is mildy improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime. The patient has been experiencing excessive secretions and low oxygenation despite increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), making him not stable enough for extubation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/58 to 137/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and no abdominal tenderness. Laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is due to pneumonia and the migration of a tracheal stent. The patient continues to have secretions and now has an infiltrate on the right lower lung.

   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Continued to have
   secretions and now with infiltrate on right lower lung.  Patient
   initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing FIO2 requirements,
   so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Now hypoxic today likely
   secondary to secretions; no fever or WBC to suggest worsening PNA.
   Cultures here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and
   WBC trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 9 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement, today
   - wean FIO2 today
   - trial of extubation if hypoxia resolves and Y-stent can be placed
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid recussitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP

   3.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinphilia and eosinophilia is mildy improving.

He is scheduled for placement of a Y-stent today. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is still experiencing hypoxia likely due to secretions. The cultures are negative, but the patient has a history of MRSA.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pneumonia and migration of the tracheal stent. There may be a need for positive pressure ventilation due to his tracheobronchial malacia. Hypoxia is still present, possibly due to secretions, and could lead to further respiratory compromise if not managed appropriately.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved after fluid resuscitation and he is currently off pressors. However, monitoring for any signs of recurrent hypotension is important as it could indicate septic shock or other causes of low blood pressure.

3. Eosinophilia: The patient has eosinophilia, which has improved since switching antibiotics. It is important to monitor the CBC"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal stent (?
   Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**].  Continued to have
   secretions and now with infiltrate on right lower lung.  Patient
   initially doing well on SBT, however, had increasing FIO2 requirements,
   so may need positive pressure due to TBM.  Now hypoxic today likely
   secondary to secretions; no fever or WBC to suggest worsening PNA.
   Cultures here are negative, but from OSH, positive for MRSA.  Fever and
   WBC trending down here on antibiotics.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 10 today)
   -trend fever curve, wbc, culture if spikes.
   -awaiting Y stent placement, today by IP
   - wean FIO2 today
   - trial of extubation if hypoxia resolves and Y-stent can be placed
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid resuscitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinophilia and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff, trending down slowly (15.5
 13.7 today)
   - continue vaco/ceftaz

","Summary:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tracheobronchomalacia.
- He was admitted with respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
- The patient had secretions and developed infiltrate on the right lower lung.
- He initially did well on spontaneous breathing trials but required increasing FiO2, suggesting the need for positive pressure ventilation.
- Cultures are negative, but he has MRSA from OSH.
- He is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime (day 10 today).
- The fever and WBC count are trending down with antibiotics.
- The patient is awaiting Y-stent placement today by interventional pulmonology.
- Weaning of FiO2 and trial of extubation are planned if hypoxia resolves and Y-stent can be placed.
- The patient's blood pressure has improved with fluid resuscitation and is off pressors for several days.
- He is on hold from home antihypertensives and will continue with vancomycin and ceftazidime for pneumonia.
- Blood and sputum cultures will be followed, and urine output will be monitored.
- The patient had eosinophilia at OSH on vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin but no evidence of drug rash at present.
- There is no clear etiology of eosinophilia at present.
- Zosyn was switched to ceftazidime due to eosinophilia, and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
- The patient's creatinine is at baseline of 1-1.2.
- He is on prophylactic heparin, PPI, and bowel regimen.
- Tube feeds are planned.
- The patient's contact information and code status are documented.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially had respiratory failure due to pneumonia and migration of tracheal stent. There is a potential for recurrent respiratory failure if the Y-stent placement is unsuccessful or if there are complications related to the procedure.
2. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension initially but improved with fluid resuscitation. There is a potential for recurrent hypotension if there are ongoing fluid losses or if there are complications from the medications or procedures.
3. Eosinophilia: The patient had eosinophilia at OSH on certain antibiotics, and it is important to monitor for any signs of allergic reactions or drug-induced eosinophilia.
4. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and the presence of MRSA.
5. Renal insufficiency: The patient has chronic renal insufficiency, and it is important to monitor his renal function closely, especially with the use of medications like vancomycin.

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate is 81 beats per minute, blood pressure is 102/58 mmHg, respiratory rate is 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 96%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals persistent retrocardiac density, hazy density on the right base, and a small amount of pleural fluid on the right side. 

The patient's current assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to pneumonia and migration of tracheal stent. The stent has been removed, but the patient continues to have secretions and an infiltrate on the right lower lung. The patient is initially doing well on a spontaneous breathing trial but has increasing FiO2 requirements, suggesting the need for positive pressure due to tracheobronchial malacia. 

The patient's hypoxia today is likely secondary to secretions, with no fever or white blood cell count to suggest worsening pneumonia. Cultures are negative, but from another"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis. He was admitted with respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient has been on vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics since admission.

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, hypotension, eosinophilia, and chronic renal insufficiency. The respiratory failure is attributed to post-obstructive pneumonia caused by the migrated tracheal stent. The stent was removed on August 30th, and a Y stent was placed yesterday. The patient's fever and white blood cell count are trending down, indicating a response to antibiotics.

The patient's hypotension has improved after fluid resuscitation and is now off pressors for several days. The eosinophilia is thought to be related to the antibiotics administered at the outside hospital, and there is no evidence of drug rash. The exact etiology of eosinophilia is unclear at this time.

The patient's chronic renal insufficiency is stable, with creatinine levels within the baseline range of 1-1.2.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if there is a recurrence of pneumonia or if the tracheal stent causes further obstruction.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure may drop again if"

","Summary:
Mr. [Known lastname 917] is an 87-year-old male with hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tracheobronchomalacia admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. He is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/67 to 157/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's physical examination shows rhonchi bilaterally in the lungs and warm, well-perfused extremities. His neurologic examination reveals that he is sedated and opens his eyes to voice. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 thousand/mm³ and an elevated eosinophil count. The patient has been extubated and is breathing independently, with improved respiratory function after placement of a Y stent. He also has mild hypotension, which has improved with fluid resuscitation, and his creatinine levels are at baseline. The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, likely due to recent anesthesia, ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance. He has a history of chronic renal insufficiency and a previous failed bedside swallow study. The patient's care plan includes continuing antibiotics, weaning"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure/TBM.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal
   stent (? Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**], Y stent placed
   [**9-2**].  Afebrile and WBC trending down here on antibiotics.  Extubated
   on RA. Resp function appears improved s/p Y stent.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 12 today) for total of 14 day course
   - culture if spikes.
   -continue Mucomyst nebs per IP
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid resuscitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinophilia and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff, Eos trending down slowly
   - continue vaco/ceftaz
   .
   5.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   6. Agitation/Confusion: Likely delirium multifactorial in setting of
   recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance.
   - Zyprexa standing dose 5mg in AM, 10mg in PM, with Haldol PRN
   - Continually re-orient pt
   - Optimize sleep schedule if possible
   - Avoid benzos
   .
   7. Aspiration Risk: Failed bedside swallow at [**Hospital1 **] last month.
   - Swallow study here
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PEG

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis admitted for respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia.
- The patient has been on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime antibiotics for pneumonia.
- The patient was extubated on respiratory assistance and shows improved respiratory function after placing a Y stent.
- The patient's blood pressure improved with fluid resuscitation and is now off pressors.
- The patient has eosinophilia, which was present at OSH and was likely due to an allergic reaction to Vancomycin/Zosyn/Levaquin.
- The patient's creatinine levels are at baseline.
- The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, likely due to recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance.
- The patient is at high risk for aspiration and needs a swallow study.
- The patient has a full code status.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. Although the patient has shown improvement after the placement of a Y stent, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if proper respiratory support is not maintained.
2. Pneumonia: The patient is still on Vancomycin and Ceftazidime antibiotics for pneumonia. There is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance or not fully resolving the infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure/TBM.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal
   stent (? Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**], Y stent placed
   [**9-2**].  Afebrile and WBC trending down here on antibiotics.  Extubated
   on RA. Resp function appears improved s/p Y stent.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 12 today) for total of 14 day course
   - culture if spikes.
   -continue Mucomyst nebs per IP
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid resuscitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinophilia and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff, Eos trending down slowly
   - continue vaco/ceftaz
   .
   5.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   6. Agitation/Confusion: Likely delirium multifactorial in setting of
   recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance.
   - Zyprexa standing dose 5mg in AM, 10mg in PM, with Haldol PRN
   - Continually re-orient pt
   - Optimize sleep schedule if possible
   - Avoid benzos
   .
   7. Aspiration Risk: Failed bedside swallow at [**Hospital1 **] last month.
   - Swallow study here
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PEG
   .
   Ppx: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.
   Tube feeds. (needs swallow study)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis (TBM) admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. The patient was intubated and received antibiotics for the infection. The tracheal stent was removed on August 30th, and a Y stent was placed on September 2nd. The patient's respiratory function has improved since the Y stent placement. The patient was extubated and now requires non-invasive ventilation support. The patient's blood pressure has improved with fluid resuscitation and is no longer on pressors. The patient's eosinophilia is improving, and the antibiotic regimen has been adjusted accordingly. The patient's baseline creatinine levels are within normal range. The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, which is likely due to recent anesthesia, Ativan use, and sleep cycle disturbance. The patient's risk for aspiration is high, and a swallow study is needed. The patient's code status is full code. The patient's current medications include Heparin (prophylaxis), Lansoprazole, and Zyprexa. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 138/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure/TBM.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal
   stent (? Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**], Y stent placed
   [**9-2**].  Afebrile and WBC trending down here on antibiotics.  Extubated
   on RA. Resp function appears improved s/p Y stent.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 14 today) for total of 14 day course
   - culture if spikes.
   -continue Mucomyst nebs per IP
   .
   2.  Hypotension.  BP improved s/p fluid resuscitation.  Now off
   pressors for several days.
   - hold home antihypertensive
   - continue vanco/ceftaz for pneumonia
   - f/u blood, sputum cultures
   - follow UOP
   .
   3.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinophilia and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff, Eos trending down slowly
   - continue vaco/ceftaz
   .
   5.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   6. Agitation/Confusion: Likely delirium multifactorial in setting of
   recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance.
   - Zyprexa standing dose 5mg in AM, 10mg in PM, with Haldol PRN
   - Continually re-orient pt
   - Optimize sleep schedule if possible
   - Avoid benzos
   .
   7. Aspiration Risk: Failed Swallow Study yesterday but possible that he
   may improve and avoid need for PEG
   - Re-eval on Monday
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PEG if still failing
   .
   Ppx: Heparin SQ, PPI, bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tuberculosis. He was admitted with respiratory failure due to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. He is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime for a total of 14-day antibiotic treatment. The patient's respiratory function has improved since the placement of a Y stent. He also has hypotension, which has improved with fluid resuscitation. His eosinophilia is improving after switching antibiotics. His creatinine levels are at baseline. The patient is experiencing agitation and confusion, likely due to delirium. He is being treated with Zyprexa and Haldol. The patient failed a swallow study, indicating an increased risk of aspiration, and a repeat evaluation is scheduled for Monday. He has a health care proxy and full code status. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds and prophylactic heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/TBM - The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. Continued monitoring and treatment with antibiotics are necessary to prevent further respiratory complications.

2. Hypotension - The patient's hypotension has improved with fluid resuscitation. However, continued monitoring of blood pressure and follow-up cultures are required to assess the effectiveness of treatment and prevent future hypotension episodes.

3. Eosinophilia - The patient had eosinophilia during"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 917**] is an 87 yo male with HTN, CRI, TBM admitted with
   respiratory failure secondary to migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia,
   on Vanco/Ceftaz.
   .
   1.  Respiratory failure/TBM/PNA.  Due to PNA and migration of tracheal
   stent (? Post obstructive PNA).  Stent removed on [**8-30**], Y stent placed
   [**9-2**].  Afebrile and WBC trending down here on antibiotics.  Extubated
   on RA. Resp function appears improved s/p Y stent.
   -continue vanco/ceftaz (day 14 today) for total of 14 day course
   - culture if spikes.
   -continue Mucomyst nebs per IP
   - CXR with bibasilar consolidations, prob aspiration; due to stop abx
   today, sats 100% on room air; team will follow closely
   - continue aspiration precautions
   .
   2.  Eosinophilia.  Patient had eosinophilia at OSH on
   vanco/zosyn/levaquin at OSH.  No evidence of drug rash at present.  No
   clear etiology of eosinphilia at present.  Zosyn was switched to ceftaz
   given eosinophilia and eosinophilia is mildly improving.
   - monitor CBC with Diff, Eos trending down slowly
   .
   3.  CRI.  Creatinine is at baseline of 1 - 1.2.
   .
   4. Agitation/Confusion: Likely delirium multifactorial in setting of
   recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance.
   - Zyprexa standing dose 5mg in AM, 10mg in PM, with Haldol PRN
   - Continually re-orient pt
   - Optimize sleep schedule if possible
   - Avoid benzos
   .
   5. Aspiration Risk: Failed Swallow Study yesterday but possible that he
   may improve and avoid need for PEG
   - Re-eval on Monday
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PEG if still failing
   - CXR demonstrates probable ongoing aspiration

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic renal insufficiency, and tracheobronchomalacia. He was admitted with respiratory failure secondary to a migrated tracheal stent and pneumonia. He is currently on vancomycin and ceftazidime antibiotics. His respiratory function appears improved after the placement of a Y stent.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure/TBM/PNA: The patient has a history of tracheobronchomalacia and migrated tracheal stent, which led to pneumonia. Although he is currently improving with antibiotics and the Y stent placement, there is still a risk of respiratory failure due to ongoing consolidation seen on the chest X-ray, suggesting possible aspiration.

2. Eosinophilia: The patient had eosinophilia at the outside hospital while receiving vancomycin, zosyn, and levaquin. Although the eosinophilia is mildly improving after switching to ceftazidime, the etiology of eosinophilia remains unclear.

3. CRI: The patient's creatinine levels are at baseline, indicating that his chronic renal insufficiency is stable. However, there is a risk of further deterioration if his renal function worsens.

4. Agitation/Confusion: The patient is likely experiencing delirium due to recent anesthesia, Ativan, and sleep cycle disturbance. Management includes reorientation, optimizing sleep schedule, avoiding benzodiaz"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tracheobronchomalacia, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and received a course of antibiotics. The patient was briefly transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU for hypoxia and tachypnea, which are likely caused by mucous plugging related to his ongoing severe tracheobronchomalacia and copious secretions. The patient has delirium, possibly due to his prolonged hospital course and ICU stay. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels can be attributed to several factors, including recent hospitalization, ongoing severe tracheobronchomalacia, copious secretions causing mucus plugging, and potential aspiration events given his poor mental status. 

2. Mucous Plugging: The patient's copious secretions are causing significant mucus plugging, leading to respiratory distress and recurrent intubations. Frequent suctioning and chest physiotherapy (CPT) are recommended to clear the airways.

3. Delirium: The patient is experiencing delirium, likely related to his prolonged hospital course and ICU stay. This can be managed by reorientation, avoiding benzodiazepines, and monitoring for organic causes such as infection or electrolyte imbalances.

4. Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient has stable CRI,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculous bronchitis, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and a course of antibiotics. The patient was briefly sent to the floor but was transferred back to the ICU due to hypoxia and tachypnea.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxia with a likely multifactorial cause, including recent hospitalization-associated community-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) MRSA pneumonia, severe tuberculous bronchitis, and copious secretions causing mucus plugging. Aspiration events cannot be ruled out given ongoing tube feedings and poor mental status. There is also a possibility of volume overload from cardiac etiology, although the patient does not carry a diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF).

The treatment plan includes nebulizer treatments with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), albuterol, and ipratropium, as well as guaifenacin for urinary incontinence. The patient will undergo frequent chest physiotherapy (PT) and deep suctioning. Head of bed elevation (HOB) is recommended, and an echocardiogram (echo) may be repeated.

Additionally, the patient is diagnosed with delirium, likely related to the prolonged hospital course and ICU stays. Benzodiazepines should be avoided, and antipsychotic medications such as zypre"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis, and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and received a course of antibiotics. The patient was briefly transferred to the floor but is now back in the ICU due to hypoxia and tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels could be caused by several factors, including recent healthcare-associated pneumonia, severe tuberculosis, and copious secretions leading to mucus plugging. Aspiration events cannot be completely ruled out due to ongoing tube feedings and poor mental status. Volume overload from cardiac etiology should also be considered. Improvement was seen after bronchoscopy with mucous plug removal.

2. Delirium: The patient likely has delirium related to a prolonged hospital course and ICU stays. He has self-removed NGTs and rectal tubes in the ICU. Medications such as zyprexa and haldol are being used for delirium management. Reorientation and avoidance of benzodiazepines are also part of the treatment plan. Organic etiology should be ruled out by conducting tests such as TSH, RPR, and B12.

3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient's renal function is currently stable, but it should be monitored closely. Medications should be dosed accordingly based on renal function.

4. Anemia: The"

   87 yo male with history of MRSA PNA, TBM, and recent respiratory
   failure, now s/p Y-stenting and course of antibiotics, called out to
   floor briefly, but now transferred back to the ICU for hypoxia and
   tachypnea.
   .
   #. Hypoxia -  DDx is broad. this is likely a multifactorial process, as
   pt with recent HCAP MRSA PNA, ongoing severe TBM, and copious
   secretions causing mucus plugging. Can not r/o an aspiration event
   given ongoing TFs and poor mental status. Doesn't carry dx of CHF, but
   can't exclude volume overload from cardiac etiology. Improved since
   bronch with mucous plug removal yesterday.
   -- NAC nebs standing
   -- albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing
   -- guaifenacin standing
   -- chest PT TID
   -- frequent deep suctioning

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis (TBM), and recent respiratory failure. He underwent Y-stenting and received antibiotics. The patient was briefly transferred to the floor but is now back in the ICU for hypoxia and tachypnea.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely a multifactorial process. It could be due to recent healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), severe TBM, copious secretions causing mucus plugging, and potential aspiration event given ongoing tracheal feeding (TFs) and poor mental status. Other possible causes include volume overload from cardiac etiology, although the patient does not have a diagnosed history of congestive heart failure (CHF).

Plan for Hypoxia:
- Administer N-acetylcysteine (NAC) nebs standing
- Provide albuterol + ipratropium nebs standing
- Give guaifenacin standing
- Perform chest physical therapy (PT) three times a day
- Conduct frequent deep suctioning
- Elevate head of bed (HOB)
- Follow up with sputum cultures from bronchoscopic evaluation

2. Delirium: The patient is likely experiencing delirium related to prolonged hospitalization and ICU stay. The patient self-removed nasogastric tubes (NGTs) and rectal tubes in the ICU"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of MRSA pneumonia, tuberculosis (TBM), and recent respiratory failure. The patient underwent Y-stenting and a course of antibiotics. He was briefly transferred to the floor but is now back in the ICU for hypoxia and tachypnea.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen levels may be due to multifactorial causes such as recent healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), severe TBM, and copious secretions causing mucus plugging. Aspiration events cannot be ruled out given the ongoing tracheal feeding and poor mental status. Volume overload from cardiac etiology is also a consideration.

2. Delirium/Dementia: The patient is likely experiencing delirium related to the prolonged hospital course and ICU stay. Self-removal of NGTs and rectal tubes in the ICU suggests an altered mental status. Management includes standing zyprexa and haldol prn, reorientation, avoidance of benzodiazepines, and ruling out organic etiologies.

3. Chronic Renal Insufficiency (CRI): The patient's renal function should be monitored closely, and medications should be dosed accordingly.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable, but further monitoring of CBC daily and trending Hct is recommended.

5. Feeding: The patient failed swallow studies,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a chief complaint of aspiration and respiratory distress. He has tracheomalacia with a Y stent in place. The patient is agitated and has underlying dementia. His vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate. The patient's respiratory support includes NAC nebs, Alb/Atrovent nebs, and chest physical therapy. His labs show elevated WBC count and elevated CRP levels, indicating a possible infection. The patient's nutritional status is being assessed, with plans for speech and swallow evaluation to determine if advanced nutrition can be provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and hypoxia suggests the possibility of respiratory failure. This is supported by the need for respiratory support, including NAC nebs and Alb/Atrovent nebs. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Infection: The elevated WBC count and CRP levels indicate an inflammatory response, which may suggest an infection. The patient's history of aspiration increases the risk of aspiration pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be considered.

3. Dementia Exacerbation: The patient's underlying dementia appears to be exacerbated based on the progress note. Further evaluation, including checking TSH, RPR, and B12 levels, is recommended. A geriatrics consult may also"
