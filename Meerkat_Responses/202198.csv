","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of hep C, autoimmune hepatitis, and HIV+ who presented with poor mental status (MS). She was previously admitted to the hospital for liver issues and had completed a stay in rehab. However, she became lethargic last night and was brought to the emergency department. In the ED, she complained of pain but could not localize it. Her vital signs were unstable, with blood pressure in the 100s/50s and temperature at 99.6Â°F. She received 2 liters of fluids and her blood pressure improved to the 100s/50s. Cultures were drawn and antibiotics were started including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. There were no signs of ascites on ultrasound, so paracentesis was not performed. Her NH (neutrophil count) was 111 and no lumbar puncture was done.

The patient appeared uncomfortable on arrival to the floor. Over the next 24 hours, she received multiple infusions and medications including vancomycin, acyclovir, ceftriaxone, and piperacillin-tazobactam. She has a history of HAART since 1998, autoimmune hepatitis, and hep C diagnosed in 1998. She also had small bowel resection with ostomy for recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, portal gast"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of hep C, autoimmune hepatitis, and HIV+. She was previously admitted to the hospital for liver issues and was ready to be discharged from rehab. However, she became lethargic last night and was taken to the emergency department (ED).

Upon arrival at the ED, the patient complained of pain but did not localize it. Her vital signs were recorded as blood pressure (BP) in the 100s/50s, heart rate (HR) of 86 bpm, respiratory rate (RR) of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%. She received 2 liters of oxygen and her BP improved to the 100s/50s. Cultures were drawn, and she was started on antibiotics including Vancomycin, Zosyn, and acyclovir. No ascites were found on ultrasound, so paracentesis was not performed. Her NH (likely referring to ammonia) level was 111, and no lumbar puncture (LP) was done.

The patient was then transferred to the ICU floor, where she looked uncomfortable. It was noted that she had no allergies, including to nicotine. She experienced an event described as ""coma?"" possibly related to her medication Bactrim (Oral) (Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim). She received infusions of various medications, including acyclovir, vancomycin,CTX, and Zosyn.

In terms of medical and family history, the patient has been on HAART since 2098 and was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and hep C in the same year. She also underwent a small bowel resection with an ostomy for recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), as well as having portal gastropathy and severe esophagitis. Her current medications include lactulose, dapsone, coletra, truvada, lasix, aldactone, flonase, cipro, and oxycodone IR. She smokes one pack per day.

The patient's brother has a history of alpha-1 antitrypsin and underwent a liver transplant.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

Physical examination revealed a thin and anxious patient with clear breath sounds and a new systolic murmur. Neurologically, she was oriented to person only and had asterisks. Skin assessment was not performed.

Laboratory results showed elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and lactate levels, as well as low platelet count and albumin. Imaging revealed no evidence of bleeding or mass on a head CT. Microbiology results showed a positive blood culture for staph.

Assessment and plan include poor mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, high WBC"

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Provisional Findings Impression: BMzb MON [**2107-9-19**] 8:00 PM
   PFI: TIPS patency is documented. There is no evidence of stenosis,
   thrombosis or occlusion. A small amount of ascites is present.
   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis.
- She was admitted from a nursing home with a change in mental status (MS) likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
- The patient has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis on the mitral valve.
- Her condition has been complicated by hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), hepatic encephalopathy, and possible hepatocellular carcinoma (ESLD).
- The patient is currently on multiple medications including vancomycin for Staphylococcus aureus infection, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, thiamine supplementation, and HAART medications for HIV.
- The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Systemic emboli: Due to the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve, there is a risk of systemic embolization, which can lead to complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism.

2. Heart failure: Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation have been observed, which can result in heart failure if left untreated or worsens.

3. Infection recurrence: The patient is already on multiple"

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis. She was admitted from a nursing home with a change in mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself, particularly a CNS infection as the patient is at high risk given her HIV status.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Change in mental status: The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and/or infection with Staphylococcus aureus. She is being treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and empiric vancomycin. Thiamine is also being given to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy.

2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline blood pressures were in the 100s/50s at the nursing home. Now she meets SIRS criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. She is not initially responsive to fluids. Measures such as IV fluid boluses, albumin administration, and pressors are being considered to keep pressures up. The patient's husband has been consulted, and the patient has DNR/DNI status.

3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is improving with IV hydration, suggesting pre-renal causes. She is producing urine at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Further evaluation of urine lytes"

   TTE:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Now meets SIRS
   criteria with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially responsive to fluids.
   - will give IVF boluses as needed to keep pressures up
   - will give albumin to try to increase intravascular pressure
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis. She was admitted from a nursing home with a change in mental status likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, which may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself, particularly a CNS infection given her HIV status.

The patient has been diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis on the mitral valve. The echocardiogram shows a small vegetation on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve, most likely a vegetation. Moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation are also seen. The patient's right upper quadrant ultrasound shows TIPS patency with no evidence of stenosis, thrombosis, or occlusion, and a small amount of ascites is present.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/58 mmHg to 113/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 7 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.6 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 69 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular
   filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
   normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There is small vegetation on
   the mitral valve. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: there is a small (<0.5cm) mobile echodensity on the
   posterior leaflet of the mitral valve that is most likely a vegetation.
   No other [**Year (4 digits) 4746**] or abscess seen. Moderate mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for
   review) of [**2104-1-11**], the mitral valve vegetation was not noted on the
   prior study. The degrees of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary hypertension have increased.

   Assessment and Plan
   48 yo female with PMH HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis
   admitted from NH with change in MS likely from hepatic encephalopathy
   that may be secondary to infection or just from infection itself -
   particularly CNS infection as patient at high risk given HIV status.
    #. Staph Endocarditis on MV:
   -          Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   -          Vancomycin X 6 weeks
   -          Check serial anaerobic cultures
   -          Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects
   inc. heart failure
   -          ID consult for antibiotic recs ?adding second [**Doctor Last Name **] for
   complicated endocarditis.
   #. UTI: Patient with Staph in urine.
   -          F/u urine culture final read
   -          On vancomycin
   #. Right  shoulder pain: concern for septic arthritis vs trauma while
   altered MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 621**].
   -          Ortho consult
   -          XR of shoulder
   -          Tap if necessary to r/o septic arthritis.
   .
    #. Change in MS: hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by infection with
   Staph
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy
   - Vancomycin for now
   - thiamine for ?wernickes encephalopathy.
   #. hypotension: Patient's baseline BPs 100s/50s at NH. Met  SIRS
   criteria on admission with WBCs and tachycardia. Not initially
   responsive to fluids but now BP at baseline.
   - will give IVF boluses with albumin as needed to keep pressures up
   - D/W husband and ok to give pressors. Pt is DNR/DNI though.
   - Will follow svo2 and lactate to assess perfusion
   - Will hold anti-hypertensives
   #. ARF: Better with IV hydration so likely pre-renal. Now UOP
   30mL/hour. urine lytes/osm c/w mixed picture but patient was taking
   lasix before admission.
   - Will check urine urea
   - Will continue to increase intravascular volume and follow UOP.
   #. HIV: Increased HAART meds recently.
   - CD4 16, VL low
   - Atoviquone PPx for PCP (normally on dapsone but changed [**2-26**] renal
   failure)
   -Will follow ID recs re:HAART and prophylaxis as patient technically
   now also qualifies for toxo and MAC prophylaxis.
   #. ESLD: MELD score is 28. Was previously worked up by transplant here
   - Lactulose
   - holding lasix and aldactone for now given hypotension
   - Hepatology consulting re transplant
 will f/u recs
   #. HCV: Will check viral load to ensure re-activation is not cause of
   her deterioration in MS.
   - Transplant will see her

","The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of HIV, HCV, autoimmune hepatitis, and cirrhosis admitted from a nursing home with a change in mental status likely from hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has several ongoing medical issues that require attention:

1. Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis on the mitral valve:
   - Follow up sensitivities of blood cultures.
   - Vancomycin for 6 weeks.
   - Check serial anaerobic cultures.
   - Monitor for signs of systemic emboli and cardiac effects including heart failure.
   - Infectious disease consult for antibiotic recommendations. Consider adding a second doctor for complicated endocarditis.

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with Staphylococcus aureus:
   - Follow up urine culture final read.
   - Currently on vancomycin.

3. Right shoulder pain:
   - Concern for septic arthritis versus trauma while altered mental status.
   - Orthopedic consult.
   - X-ray of the shoulder.
   - Tap if necessary to rule out septic arthritis.

4. Change in mental status (hepatic encephalopathy) precipitated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus:
   - Lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy.
   - Vancomycin for now.
   - Thiamine for possible Wernicke's encephalopathy.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with HIV and cirrhosis. He was admitted to the ICU with suspected sepsis secondary to MRSA bacteremia. The patient has been receiving vancomycin and other ICU medications. He is currently more awake, thirsty, and hungry, denying any pain. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/64 mmHg to 78/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of right shoulder pain. Physical examination findings include jaundice, restricted motion of the right shoulder, and muscle wasting. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and positive Staphylococcus aureus in the urine. The patient's HIV viral load is 679 copies/mL.

Potential Complications:
1. MRSA Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA sepsis, and treatment with vancomycin is ongoing. There is a potential complication of ongoing sepsis and septic shock if the infection does not respond to treatment.
2. MV Endocarditis: The patient has evidence of mitral valve vegetation on transthoracic echo, which raises concern for mitral valve endocard"
