 DIARRHEA
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   98 Russian speaking female presents with lethargy and fever.
   .
   * Lethargy
   Probably due to infection, dehydration.
   - Treat diarrhea and ?UTI as below
   - Continue IVF overnight
   - Follow neuro exam. Will hold on neuroimaging tonight, no localizing
   deficits.
   .
   * Diarrhea
   Patient with multiple presentations with diarrhea, frequently following
   quinolones.
   - Repeat C diff assay
   - Empiric PO vancomycin. Family cannot verify ?allergy in OMR. Systemic
   absorption is minimal, so I believe this is a reasonable option for her
   especially as she has had multiple recurrences on metronidazole.
   - HOLD on further antimotility agents
   .
   * Question UTI
   Mild pyuria on urinalysis.
   - Will treat with TMPSMX empirically, discontinue if culture negative.
   .
   * Pleural effusions
   CXR shows bilateral effusions. Cause uncertain, recent echo fairily
   unremarkable. She did have a left sided effusion on [**6-28**] CXR. With her
   history of breast cancer, malignancy is a possibility. Think infection
   is less likely.
   - Consider diagnostic thoracentesis
   .
   * Atrial fibrillation
   Not on anticoagulation as an outpatient.
   - Continue ASA daily
   .
   * Hypertension
   - Hold home antihypertensives for now, may reintroduce if BP remains
   stable overnight

","Summary:
- The patient is a 98-year-old Russian-speaking female with lethargy and fever.
- She has multiple comorbidities, including breast cancer.
- She presents with diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and bilateral pleural effusions.
- She is experiencing dehydration and has a history of allergies to vancomycin.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 74/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diarrhea: The patient has a history of multiple recurrences of diarrhea after taking quinolones. This could be due to Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), which needs to be confirmed by repeating the C. diff assay. Empiric PO vancomycin has been started, considering the patient's potential allergy to vancomycin and the minimal systemic absorption expected. Further antimotility agents will be held.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has mild pyuria on urinalysis. Empiric treatment with TMP-SMX has been initiated, and the antibiotic will be discontinued if the culture is negative.
3. Pleural Effusions: The patient has bilateral pleural effusions, with an uncertain cause. Recent echocardiography was fairly unremarkable"

","The patient is a 98-year-old Russian speaking female who presented with lethargy and fever. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.2Â°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 74/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

On physical examination, the patient appears to be an elderly woman lying in bed without acute distress. She has sclera that are anicteric and dry mucous membranes. There is jugular venous distention observed in her neck. Her lungs show bilateral rales. The cardiovascular examination reveals irregularly irregular heart sounds with no murmurs or gallops. The abdomen is soft with bowel sounds that are present, and there is mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. The extremities are warm without edema, and palpable distal pulses are present. Neurological examination shows that the patient opens her eyes to voice, tracks, follows commands intermittently, wiggles toes to command, and has mild erythema near the sacrum.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 310 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL, sodium of 123 mg/dL, potassium of 0.4 mg/dL, chloride of 24 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 3"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaints are C diff colitis, hypotension, and pleural effusions. The patient was hemodynamically stable overnight, but required one bolus of fluid for a blood pressure in the 70-80s. Oxygenation was good on minimal supplemental oxygen. The patient is afebrile with normal white blood cell count. Urine output is about 30 cc/hr.

The patient has a history of allergies to vancomycin, resulting in a rash. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), and ceftriaxone.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/36 mmHg to 74/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of diarrhea. Flowsheet data indicates that the patient has received a total of 1,542 mL of IV fluids since midnight, with a balance of -278 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient is a thin, frail individual who appears not to be in acute distress. Eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 98-year-old female who presented with lethargy and fever. She has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection (CDI) and is experiencing diarrhea. The patient also has hypotension, which is thought to be secondary to fluid losses from diarrhea. She has been given IV fluid boluses and placed on maintenance fluids. Overnight, the patient desaturated and had crackles in her lungs, indicating possible fluid overload. Fluids were stopped, and her blood pressure is now stable in the 120s. The patient has a higher oxygen requirement and may need a gentle diuretic if she continues to have difficulty breathing. 

The patient has bilateral pleural effusions on chest X-ray, with an uncertain cause. A recent echo was fairly unremarkable. The effusions may be due to volume overload, and a therapeutic and diagnostic thoracentesis may be considered if her breathing worsens. 

The patient has a history of breast cancer, which raises the possibility of malignancy as the cause of the pleural effusions. Infection is less likely. 

The patient's diarrhea has improved, and she has tested positive for C. diff. She has had previous occurrences of C. diff colitis that recurred despite metronidazole treatment. Therefore, she will continue with PO vancomycin. 

The patient is more awake and cooperative now, and her lethargy is likely due to the C. diff infection and dehydration from"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly woman with a chief complaint of lethargy and fever. She has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, which has caused diarrhea. The patient has also shown signs of urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypotension, likely due to dehydration from the diarrhea. She has been experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF) and has a history of breast cancer.

The patient was given a bolus of IV fluids to address her hypotension and low urine output. However, this resulted in desaturation and crackles heard in the lungs, possibly due to volume overload. Fluids were stopped, but no diuretics have been given yet.

The patient has been prescribed multiple antibiotics, including metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin, for the C. diff infection. She is also on flagyl for the UTI and ASA for atrial fibrillation.

The patient's recent lab results show normal levels of white blood cells, hematocrit, platelets, creatinine, and glucose. However, her calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low, and her potassium and sodium bicarbonate levels are within normal range.

Radiology images reveal bilateral pleural effusions, which could be related to the patient's underlying conditions or volume overload.

Plan:

1. Continue treatment for C. diff infection with PO vancomycin and IV flagyl.
2. Hold IV fluids"

","Summary:
The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, hypotension, and atrial fibrillation. They were given fluids yesterday to support urine output but experienced a decline in O2 saturation, so fluids were stopped. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable at 105-120 mmHg. They are afebrile and receiving treatment for C. difficile. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, and they have a history of allergies to vancomycin, rash with Bactrim, and no known drug allergies to other medications. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 123/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on maintenance fluids and receiving prophylactic heparin. The patient's physical examination is unremarkable except for right and left lower extremity edema and evidence of past antibiotic use. The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24.1 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels at 2.1 mg/dL. The patient's abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Imaging reveals left effusion and interstitial and alveolar infiltrates in the mid and upper zones."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman who was admitted to the ICU with lethargy and fever. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and was not on anticoagulation as an outpatient. The patient also has a history of right femur fracture and underwent surgery for it a few months ago.

The patient's vital signs show that she is currently stable with a heart rate between 70-87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/44 mmHg to 153/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. She is slightly overweight with a current weight of 63 kg compared to her admission weight of 56.1 kg.

The patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), which has improved, and she is now only on oral vancomycin. Her diarrhea has improved, and the Flexiseal has been removed. The plan is to continue PO vancomycin, as systemic absorption is minimal, and to hold any antimotility agents.

The patient's lethargy has also improved, and she is more awake and cooperative. It is believed that the lethargy was due to the C. diff infection and dehydration from diarrhea. Daily neuro exams are recommended, and no imaging is required at this time.

The patient's atrial fibrillation is not on anticoagulation as an outpatient."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly woman admitted to the ICU with lethargy and fever. She has a history of allergies to vancomycin, a rash from Bactrim, and is currently on prophylactic heparin. Her vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/44 to 153/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She has atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. She also has a history of C. difficile infection, urinary tract infection, hypotension, and pleural effusions. The patient's condition has improved, with improved alertness, resolution of hypotension, and improvement in C. difficile diarrhea. However, she still has mild erythema near her sacrum, bilateral rales in her lungs, and tenderness in her lower left quadrant. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's recent blood cultures are negative, and her CXR shows persistent bilateral pleural effusions. The plan is to continue vancomycin for C. difficile infection, hold atenolol for hypertension, and monitor her neurological status. The patient's son has requested an interpreter for a discussion about the patient's discharge plan."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a chief complaint of C diff colitis and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with C diff infection and is responding to antibiotics, with improving diarrhea. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypotension, but not in shock. The patient is currently experiencing mild respiratory distress and has evidence of interstitial and alveolar edema on chest X-ray, as well as pleural effusions. The patient's heart rate is well controlled in atrial fibrillation (AFib).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C diff infection: The patient is at risk of complications associated with C diff infection, such as severe diarrhea, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially life-threatening colitis.
2. UTI: The patient has a urinary tract infection, which can lead to symptoms like urinary urgency, frequency, and pain. If left untreated, it can progress to a kidney infection or sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion to vital organs, increasing the risk of organ damage or failure.
4. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory symptoms, along with evidence of interstitial and alveolar edema on chest X-ray, suggest a possible complication related to her respiratory system, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia.
5. AFib: The patient's atrial fibrillation may increase the"
