   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 year old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN,
   atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD s/p recent ex-lap for small bowel
   obstruction x 2, admitted for evidence of lower GI bleed.
   1)  Lower GI Bleed: known diverticular disease, given neg NG lavage in
   ED upper GI bleed less likely. Received 5 units PRBC
 Hct 25.5
   27.9
28.7
 29.3
 30.6. Negative tagged RBC scan and maroon-colored
   stool suggests non-brisk bleed, and stabilization of Hct suggests
   resolution of active bleed. Colonscopy unlikely to be performed before
   Monday, if at all, given his recent abdominal procedure.
   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >28
   - Continue PPI daily
   - Follow up surgery and GI recs
   2) Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic Anemia: GI bleed, but baseline
   HCT 25-30 likely due to ESRD and anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend Hct as above
   3) Elevated troponin, now stable. Stable CK. Likely represents demand
   ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of
   troponin. Since troponin has stabilized in the past 24hrs, and he lacks
   a clinical syndrome consistent with ACS, we will withhold further
   collection of cardiac enzymes at this time.
   4) UTI: On Meropenem given history of ESBLs. We can consider narrowing
   coverage pending identification of pathogen on UCx.
   -Cont Meropenem day 1 of [**6-25**].
   -Follow up UCx .
   5) ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Current evidence of fluid overload but with
   maintenance of adequate Sp02.
   - Follow up with renal regarding HD.
   - Continue nephrocaps, renagel
   - Darbopoetin at the time of HD
   6) Soft tissue density on CT suspicious for diverticulitis.  However,
   he lacks symptoms consistent with diverticulitis such as focal
   abdominal pain at this time. Although indicated for UTI, his current
   regimen of meropenem would provide coverage of the most common bacteria
   associated with diverticulitis (GNR and anaerobes); however, we would
   not continue meropenem for diverticulitis coverage if UCx allows for
   the use of a more targeted abx given lack of clinical evidence of
   diverticulitis.
   7) DM
   - Continue HISS
   8) Atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation, now paced.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   -Continue to hold warfarin, aspirin and BB held in setting of bleed.
   9) HTN:
   -Continue to hold antihypertensives in setting GI bleed
   10)  Dyslipidemia:
   -Continue simvastatin
   11) Secondary hyperparathyroidism:
   -Continue cinacelcet
   12) S/P lysis of adhesions:
   -Continue  morphine IV prn
   13)  FEN: Advance from NPO to clear fluid, pending GI/surgery
   recommendations for colonoscopy.
   14) Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, PPI
   15)  Access:
   -- Subclavian central line appears to be from last discharge [**7-15**], in
   place. Site looks clean. Needs dressing change.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He was admitted for evidence of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has known diverticular disease, and a negative tagged red blood cell scan suggests a non-brisk bleed. The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hemoglobin (Hct) levels have stabilized. A colonoscopy is unlikely to be performed before Monday, if at all, due to his recent abdominal procedure.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/53 mmHg to 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is alert and in no acute distress.

Physical examination reveals a linear midline incision with small amounts of serous exudate and no induration. The abdomen is soft, with bowel sounds present and non-distended. There is mild voluntary guarding and rebound tenderness on deep palpation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 25.5-30.6%, platelet count of 181-176 K/uL, creatinine of 4.5-5"

   significant for DM, HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hx
   tachy-brady s/p pacemaker, ESRD on HD s/p recent ex-lap for small bowel
   obstruction with evidence of lower GI bleed.

   clinical syndrome consistent with ACS, we will withhold further
   collection of cardiac enzymes at this time.

- He presented to the emergency department with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, which is likely due to known diverticular disease. The initial assessment suggests a non-brisk bleed, and the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have stabilized.
- The patient received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without an appropriate increase in Hct, indicating resolution of active bleeding.
- The patient also has elevated troponin levels, likely representing demand ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of troponin. No further cardiac enzymes are being collected at this time.
- The patient is being treated with meropenem for a urinary tract infection (UTI), particularly considering his history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. Narrowing coverage may be considered pending identification of the pathogen on urine culture.
- The patient has evidence of fluid overload but maintains adequate oxygen saturation.
- He is currently on dialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and is taking nephrocaps and renagel for ESRD. Darbopoetin will be given at the time of hemodialysis.
- There is a soft tissue density on CT"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 year old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN,
   atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD s/p recent ex-lap for small bowel
   obstruction x 2, admitted for evidence of lower GI bleed.
   1)  Lower GI Bleed: known diverticular disease, given neg NG lavage in
   ED upper GI bleed less likely. Received 5 units PRBC
 Hct 25.5
   27.9
28.7
 29.3
 30.6. Negative tagged RBC scan and maroon-colored
   stool suggests non-brisk bleed, and stabilization of Hct suggests
   resolution of active bleed. Colonscopy unlikely to be performed before
   Monday, if at all, given his recent abdominal procedure.
   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >28
   - Continue PPI daily
   - Follow up surgery and GI recs
   2) Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic Anemia: GI bleed, but baseline
   HCT 25-30 likely due to ESRD and anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend Hct as above
   3) Elevated troponin, now stable. Stable CK. Likely represents demand
   ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of
   troponin. Since troponin has stabilized in the past 24hrs, and he lacks
   a clinical syndrome consistent with ACS, we will withhold further
   collection of cardiac enzymes at this time.
   4) UTI: On Meropenem given history of ESBLs. We can consider narrowing
   coverage pending identification of pathogen on UCx.
   -Cont Meropenem day 1 of [**6-25**].
   -Follow up UCx .
   5) ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Current evidence of fluid overload but with
   maintenance of adequate Sp02.
   - Follow up with renal regarding HD.
   - Continue nephrocaps, renagel
   - Darbopoetin at the time of HD
   6) Soft tissue density on CT suspicious for diverticulitis.  However,
   he lacks symptoms consistent with diverticulitis such as focal
   abdominal pain at this time. Although indicated for UTI, his current
   regimen of meropenem would provide coverage of the most common bacteria
   associated with diverticulitis (GNR and anaerobes); however, we would
   not continue meropenem for diverticulitis coverage if UCx allows for
   the use of a more targeted abx given lack of clinical evidence of
   diverticulitis.
   7) DM
   - Continue HISS
   8) Atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation, now paced.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   -Continue to hold warfarin, aspirin and BB held in setting of bleed.
   9) HTN:
   -Continue to hold antihypertensives in setting GI bleed
   10)  Dyslipidemia:
   -Continue simvastatin
   11) Secondary hyperparathyroidism:
   -Continue cinacelcet

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD on HD), and previous surgeries for small bowel obstruction. The patient was admitted for evidence of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The note mentions that the patient has diverticular disease, which is a known cause of lower GI bleed. The negative tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan and maroon-colored stool suggest a non-brisk bleed, and the stabilization of hematocrit (Hct) suggests resolution of the active bleed. Colonoscopy is unlikely to be performed before Monday due to the patient's recent abdominal procedure.

The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) without an appropriate increase in Hct, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion. The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, but there is evidence of fluid overload. The patient's troponin levels are elevated but have stabilized, likely representing demand ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of troponin. No further collection of cardiac enzymes is planned at this time.

The patient is also diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and is currently being treated with meropenem. The coverage for UTI may need to be narrowed pending identification of the pathogen on urine culture. The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and previous small bowel obstruction surgery. He was admitted for evidence of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has known diverticular disease and negative nasogastric (NG) lavage in the emergency department, suggesting a lower GI bleed. He received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and his hematocrit (Hct) levels have stabilized.

Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI Bleed: The patient has a history of diverticular disease and evidence of lower GI bleed. Despite receiving PRBCs, his Hct levels have stabilized, suggesting resolution of active bleeding. Colonoscopy is unlikely to be performed before Monday, if at all, due to his recent abdominal procedure.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct is likely due to ESRD and anemia of chronic disease. His Hct should be trended regularly.
3. Elevated Troponin: The patient has elevated troponin levels, which have stabilized. This is likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of troponin. Further collection of cardiac enzymes is not necessary at this time.
4. UTI: The patient is on meropenem due to his history of extended-spectrum"

   Assessment and Plan
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB)
   78 year old male with a past medical history significant for DM, HTN,
   atrial fibrillation, ESRD on HD s/p recent ex-lap for small bowel
   obstruction x 2, admitted for evidence of lower GI bleed.
   1)  Lower GI Bleed: known diverticular disease, given neg NG lavage in
   ED upper GI bleed less likely. Received 5 units PRBC
 Hct 25.5
   27.9
28.7
 29.3
 30.6. Negative tagged RBC scan and maroon-colored
   stool suggests non-brisk bleed, and stabilization of Hct suggests
   resolution of active bleed. Colonscopy unlikely to be performed before
   Monday, if at all, given his recent abdominal procedure.
   - Check Hct Q6H
   - Transfuse to keep HCT >28
   - Continue PPI daily
   - Follow up surgery and GI recs
   2) Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic Anemia: GI bleed, but baseline
   HCT 25-30 likely due to ESRD and anemia of chronic disease.
   - Trend Hct as above
   3) Elevated troponin, now stable. Stable CK. Likely represents demand
   ischemia in the setting of ESRD with decreased renal clearance of
   troponin. Since troponin has stabilized in the past 24hrs, and he lacks
   a clinical syndrome consistent with ACS, we will withhold further
   collection of cardiac enzymes at this time.
   4) UTI: On Meropenem given history of ESBLs. We can consider narrowing
   coverage pending identification of pathogen on UCx.
   -Cont Meropenem day 1 of [**6-25**].
   -Follow up UCx .
   5) ESRD: On dialysis MWF. Current evidence of fluid overload but with
   maintenance of adequate Sp02.
   - Follow up with renal regarding HD.
   - Continue nephrocaps, renagel
   - Darbopoetin at the time of HD
   6) Soft tissue density on CT suspicious for diverticulitis.  However,
   he lacks symptoms consistent with diverticulitis such as focal
   abdominal pain at this time. Although indicated for UTI, his current
   regimen of meropenem would provide coverage of the most common bacteria
   associated with diverticulitis (GNR and anaerobes); however, we would
   not continue meropenem for diverticulitis coverage if UCx allows for
   the use of a more targeted abx given lack of clinical evidence of
   diverticulitis.
   7) DM
   - Continue HISS
   8) Atrial fibrillation, s/p ablation, now paced.
   - Continue amiodarone.
   -Continue to hold warfarin, aspirin and BB held in setting of bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, and previous surgeries for small bowel obstruction. He was admitted for evidence of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but has not shown an appropriate increase in hematocrit (Hct) level. The non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed small bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left, with adjacent basilar atelectasis, and a 1.4 cm soft tissue density in the transverse colon, which may represent an inflamed diverticulum with a small amount of stranding adjacent to it. A tagged red blood cell study performed was negative for any active bleed. The patient has also been started on meropenem for urinary tract infection (UTI), likely due to his history of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lower GI Bleed: The patient's history of known diverticular disease and negative tagged RBC scan suggest a non-brisk lower GI bleed. Although the Hct level has stabilized, close monitoring is required, and further intervention such as colonoscopy may be necessary depending on the clinical condition and surgeon's recommendations.
2. Acute Blood Loss Anemia on Chronic An"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 78-year-old male with a past medical history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis. He underwent recent surgery for a small bowel obstruction and was admitted for evidence of lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has shown stabilization of hematocrit (Hct) levels. A tagged red blood cell scan and maroon-colored stool suggest a non-brisk bleed, and the absence of brisk bleeding indicates resolution of the active bleed. The plan is to continue pantoprazole daily, follow up with surgery and gastroenterology recommendations, and monitor Hct levels every 8 hours.

The patient also has acute blood loss anemia on chronic anemia, likely due to the GI bleed, ESRD, and anemia of chronic disease. Trending Hct levels as before is recommended.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) for which he is being treated with meropenem. Coverage may be narrowed pending identification of the pathogen on urine culture.

The patient is on dialysis on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and has evidence of fluid overload. Hemodialysis (HD) is planned for today, along with the continuation of nephrocaps and renagel. Darbopoetin is to be given at the time of HD.

There are elevated troponin"
