   59yo woman with altered mental status in the setting of Hep C
   cirrhosis.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy given questionnable
   compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not had other
   episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.  Head CT at OSH was
   negative.  Would also consider infection (particularly SBP or
   pneumonia), especially in light of her leukocytosis.  Overdose is also
   a possibility, although family denies drug use.
   - lactulose
   - paracentesis to eval for SBP
   - UA, UCx (given recent UTI), BCx, sputum Cx
   - empiric treatment with vanc/meropenem/azithromycin (allergic to cipro
   and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA vs SBP
   - avoid sedating medications
   - thiamine IV in case there is h/o alcohol abuse
   - repeat head CT given ? abnormal finding at OSH
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient was intubated for airway protection at OSH.  Of note, her CXR
   suggests possible aspiration pneumonia.  It is unclear if she received
   IVF at OSH.
   - wean vent as tolerated
   - currently not requiring sedation; would switch to pressure support as
   she wakes up
   - treat possible PNA as above
   # Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - continue PPI
   - treatment of possible SBP as discussed above
   - restart spironolactone in AM
   # Sinus tachycardia:

   poor urine output, and tachycardia above baseline, although some level
   of tachyardia appears to be chronic in her.  [**Month (only) 51**] be exacerbated by
   acute illness.
   - albumin 25g in 500cc NS and monitor HR and urine output
   - hold diuretics until AM
   - check TSH

   # Altered Mental Status:
   Most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy given questionnable
   compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not had other
   episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.  However she is now
   status post TIPS placement and may have developed new baseline for his
   fluid dynamics. Head CT at OSH and at [**Hospital1 19**] were negative.  Would also
   consider infection (particularly SBP or pneumonia), especially in light
   of her leukocytosis.  Overdose is also a possibility, although family
   denies drug use. Pt also has some evidence of focal neurological
   findings on exam.

   - Given focal neurological findings
             - Neurology consult
             - Order MRI/MRA, discuss with Neurology
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient was intubated for airway protection at OSH.  Of note, her CXR
   suggests possible aspiration pneumonia.  It is unclear if she received
   IVF at OSH. Pt likely fluid overload, but has maintained good sats
   here. Has been satting well this am on PS 5/5.
   - keep intubated for poor mental status, and for procedures (e.g MRA)
   - currently not requiring sedation; would switch to pressure support as
   she wakes up
   - treat possible PNA as above
   # Rash: has three skin findings. [**Last Name (un) 2493**], blisters/breakdown, and a
   diffuse maculopapular rash on proximal legs and trunk. The bilsters and
   [**Last Name (un) **] are thought to be chronic , possibly manifestations of her
   psoriasis or [**3-12**] to her long term methotrexate use, though may also
   represent another process. The diffuse maculopapular rash appears to be
   newer, and looks more like a hypersensitivity reaction, likely to an
   antibiotic. Pt has known allergies to Keflex ad Cipro, and had received
   ertapenem at the OSH.  Also need to consider skin findings as [**3-12**] to

The patient was intubated for airway protection and has respiratory failure. Her chest X-ray suggests possible aspiration pneumonia. She is currently not requiring sedation and would benefit from pressure support as she wakes up.

The patient has a rash with three skin findings: blister/breakdown, [**Last Name (un) 2493**], and a diffuse maculopapular rash on the proximal legs and trunk. The blisters and [**Last Name (un) **] are thought to be chronic and possibly manifestations of her psoriasis or related to her long-term methotrexate use. The diffuse maculopapular rash appears to be newer and more consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction, likely to an antibiotic. She has known allergies to Keflex and Cipro, and received ertapenem at OSH. Skin findings should also be considered in relation to sepsis.

The patient has cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C. She has chronic diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease with a baseline creatinine of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy. He has been intubated and sedated, and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient has a history of chronic liver disease, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, tachycardia, anemia, and chronic viral hepatitis. He is also experiencing altered mental status, respiratory failure, a rash with bullous lesions, suspected urinary tract infection, sinus tachycardia, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely exacerbated by hepatic encephalopathy, but the focal ocular findings raise concerns for seizures, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or peripheral nerve injury. Consulting neurology and planning for an MRI/MRA would be appropriate.
2. Rash: The patient has two components of rash - bullous bloody lesions that are very friable and mild coagulopathy. This could potentially be toxic epidermal necrolysis. A dermatology consult for biopsy is recommended to further evaluate the rash.
3. UTI: The patient's urine culture is pending, but he is being covered with aztreonam. It is important to wait for the results before making any definitive conclusions.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with reasonable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). Extubation may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is most likely due to an exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy. However, focal ocular findings are concerning for seizures, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or peripheral nerve injury. Neurology has been consulted for further evaluation.

2. Rash: The patient has a rash with two components - bullous, bloody lesions, and very friable skin. This could be toxic epidermal necrosis, and a dermatology consult has been requested for biopsy. MacPap may be related to the carbapenem in the OSH, and all unnecessary medications are being held.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): A UTI is suspected, and cultures are pending. The patient is being covered with Aztreonam.

4. Respiratory failure: The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and has reasonable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). 

5. Sinus tachycardia: Differential diagnoses for sinus tachycardia include intravascular volume depletion and sepsis. An albumin challenge is being given to assess for intravascular volume depletion, and urine Na and output will be monitored.

6. Chronic renal failure (CRF): The patient has chronic renal failure at baseline, but the target is moving, and the patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, the note mentions several medical conditions and events that have occurred over the past day. 

The patient underwent various diagnostic tests including an EKG, arterial line placement, MRI, ultrasound, and sputum culture. The arterial line was attempted twice but could not be established. The ultrasound showed that the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is patent but with higher velocities suggesting possible stenosis or intraluminal thrombosis. 

The patient is experiencing a rash on the abdomen and lower extremities, for which topical clobetasol cream and hydrocortisone cream have been recommended. 

The neurologic assessment suggests hepatic encephalopathy, and an MRI and EEG have been advised to rule out stroke or seizure. 

The patient has allergies to cephalexin and ciprofloxacin. They have received multiple antibiotics, including azithromycin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and aztreonam. 

The patient is currently receiving ICU medications such as pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and other medications. 

The vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation at 99%. 

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned abnormalities.

","The patient is a 59-year-old woman with altered mental status in the setting of Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She has been admitted to the ICU and has several medical complications and conditions. These include:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy. TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) appears to be partially occluded per ultrasound, but MRI and CT scans have ruled out any intracranial pathology. The liver and neurology teams are following up with her.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection. Minimal pressure support with good RSBIs (respiratory system compliance index) is being provided. The plan is to extubate her in the morning.

3. Fevers and tachycardia: The patient has a mildly elevated white blood cell count. Differential diagnoses include urinary tract infection, skin/soft tissue infection, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), or aspiration pneumonia. Cultures are being followed up, and she is empirically being treated with vancomycin, aztreonam, and Flagyl. A CT abdomen is being done to rule out intraabdominal pathology.

4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 24 yesterday to 18 today. This occurred in the setting of repeated blood gas attempts and albumin challenges. Two units of blood have been transfused, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   59yo woman with altered mental status in the setting of Hep C
   cirrhosis.
   # Altered Mental Status:
   Most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy given questionnable
   compliance with lactulose at home.  Of note, she has not had other
   episodes of hepatic encephalopathy prior to this.  However she is now
   status post TIPS placement and may have developed new baseline for his
   fluid dynamics. Head CT at OSH and at [**Hospital1 19**] were negative.  Would also
   consider infection (particularly SBP or pneumonia), especially in light
   of her leukocytosis.  Overdose is also a possibility, although family
   denies drug use. Pt also has some evidence of focal neurological
   findings on exam.
   - lactulose
   - UA, UCx (given recent UTI), BCx, sputum Cx pending. Will fu.
   - Initial treatment with vanc/meropenem/azithromycin (allergic to cipro
   and keflex) for nosocomial or aspiration PNA vs SBP, but now given CXR
   not consistent atypical PNA and no evidence of a staph PNA, vanc and
   azithromycin wil be dc
   - avoid sedating medications
   - thiamine IV in case there is h/o alcohol abuse
   - Given focal neurological findings
             - Neurology consult
             - Order MRI/MRA, discuss with Neurology
   # Respiratory failure:
   Patient was intubated for airway protection at OSH.  Of note, her CXR
   suggests possible aspiration pneumonia.  It is unclear if she received
   IVF at OSH. Pt likely fluid overload, but has maintained good sats
   here. Has been satting well this am on PS 5/5.
   - keep intubated for poor mental status, and for procedures (e.g MRA)
   - currently not requiring sedation; would switch to pressure support as
   she wakes up
   - treat possible PNA as above
   # Rash: has three skin findings. [**Last Name (un) 2493**], blisters/breakdown, and a
   diffuse maculopapular rash on proximal legs and trunk. The bilsters and
   [**Last Name (un) **] are thought to be chronic , possibly manifestations of her
   psoriasis or [**3-12**] to her long term methotrexate use, though may also
   represent another process. The diffuse maculopapular rash appears to be
   newer, and looks more like a hypersensitivity reaction, likely to an
   antibiotic. Pt has known allergies to Keflex ad Cipro, and had received
   ertapenem at the OSH.  Also need to consider skin findings as [**3-12**] to
   sepsis.
   -Derm consult for rashes
   -Hold off on antihistamines until after seen by Derm
   - Follow up on BCx
   # Cirrhosis [**3-12**] Hep C
   - appreciate hepatology recs
   - Lactulose
   - Refaximine
   # Sinus tachycardia:
   Suspect she is somewhat intravascularly dry given Hct above baseline,
   poor urine output, and tachycardia above baseline, although some level
   of tachyardia appears to be chronic in her. However, her CXR appears
   fluid overloaded, consistent with her diastolic heart failure.  Her HR
   may be exacerbated by acute illness. Has had albumin 25g in 500cc NS
   x2, but this is not a sufficient fluid trial.
   - hold diuretics for now,
   - F/u TSH
   - monitor on tele and follow sats
   - Full challenge, 3 days of 1gm/kg albumin, works out to 50-50g albumin
   # Chronic diastolic heart failure:
   Currently appears hypovolemic.  Hold diuretics for now.
   - likely restart lasix and spironolactone tomorrow, depending on
   outcomes of studies
   # Chronic Kidney Disease:  baseline Cr 1.8-2.0, current Cr 2.0
   - currently has poor urine output
   - check urine lytes and monitor urine after giving albumin with saline
   # Skin tear on right leg/blisters:
   - wound care c/s
   - DERM CONSULT
   # Thyroid nodule;
   - outpatient f/u
   # FEN:  start tube feeds in AM if unable to extubate; monitor K+ given
   hyperkalemia
   # PPx:  subQ heparin, PPI
   # Code:  confirmed FULL with family
   # Dispo:  MICU for now

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 59-year-old woman with altered mental status, likely due to hepatic encephalopathy.
- She has a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and underwent TIPS placement.
- The patient is intubated for airway protection and respiratory failure.
- She has three skin findings: chronic psoriatic skin lesions, blisters/breakdown possibly related to long-term methotrexate use, and a diffuse maculopapular rash that appears to be a hypersensitivity reaction to an antibiotic.
- The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure and chronic kidney disease.
- She is currently receiving multiple medications including lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, vanc/meropenem/azithromycin for possible nosocomial or aspiration pneumonia, and thiamine IV in case of a history of alcohol abuse.
- Further tests and consultations have been ordered, including a neurology consult due to focal neurological findings, a dermatology consult for the rashes, and hepatology recommendations.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition can worsen if the patient does not comply with lactulose treatment or if there are other contributing factors.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate if she develops a more severe infection or if she is extubated prematurely.
3. Skin infections: The presence of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic viral hepatitis, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, tachycardia, anemia, and more. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to an exacerbation of hepatic encephalopathy, which may be related to the malfunctioning of the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Neurological assistance is required.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced low blood pressure overnight, which responded to blood and albumin transfusions. The differential diagnosis includes volume loss anemia and evolving sepsis. Sources of infection include pneumonia (PNA), primary abdominal source, and the need for an abdominal CT scan and broad antibiotic coverage is important.
3. Rash: The patient has two types of rashes - bullous bloody lesions that are very friable and a macropapular rash. The bullous lesions may be related to coagulopathy, and further investigation for porphyria cutanea tarda is planned. The macropapular rash is likely due to carbapenem exposure and is improving.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient is being covered with Aztreon"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old woman with altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy associated with Hepatitis C cirrhosis. She has been intubated for respiratory failure and is receiving minimal pressure support. The patient has fevers and tachycardia, and is being treated empirically for possible urinary tract infection, skin/soft tissue infection, hospital-acquired pneumonia, or aspiration pneumonia. Her hemoglobin levels have dropped from 24 to 18 today, and she is receiving a blood transfusion. She also has a rash that is being evaluated by dermatology, and there are concerns about drug rash, steroid use, or other etiologies such as acquired porphyria related to Hepatitis C. The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to Hepatitis C and methotrexate use, with an increased MELD score from 15-16 to 27. She also has refractory ascites and chronic kidney disease (CKD), previously treated for potential HepatoRenal syndrome. Her current creatinine level is stable at 1.8. The patient will be NPO following extubation and will receive nutrition as needed. She has multiple lines and is receiving prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code status is full code, and she is currently admitted to the MICU."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old woman with altered mental status in the setting of Hepatitis C (Hep C) cirrhosis. The assessment and plan section highlights several medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient has likely hepatic encephalopathy, as indicated by her altered mental status. TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) appears partially occluded, and MRI and CT scans are negative for intracranial pathology. Liver and neurology follow-up is recommended.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Minimal pressure support with good respiratory system bilevel positive airway pressure (RSBI) is being provided. Extubation is planned for the morning.

3. Fevers and Tachycardia: The patient has fevers and tachycardia, with a mildly elevated white blood cell (WBC) count. Differential diagnoses include urinary tract infection (UTI), skin/soft tissue infection, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), or aspiration pneumonia. Cultures are being followed, and empirical treatment with Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl is continued. A CT abdomen is ordered to rule out intraabdominal pathology.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) decreased from 24 yesterday to 18 today, likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and Methotrexate-induced cirrhosis. She is currently in the ICU for hepatic encephalopathy, anemia, rash, and refractory ascites. The patient's mental status has improved overnight, but she is still not at her baseline. The liver is being closely monitored, and lactulose and rifaximin have been continued. TIPS revision will not be done until the patient is stabilized, and it will be considered after the weekend.

The patient is afebrile overnight with improved leukocytosis. Gram-positive cocci in chains were found in a recent culture, suggesting a possible skin/soft tissue infection, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), or aspiration pneumonia (Asp PNA). Empirical treatment with Vancomycin, Aztreonam, and Flagyl for HAP/Asp PNA will be continued for the next 4-16 days. Cultures will be followed up, and surveillance is ongoing.

The patient's Hct level has increased to 24, which is an appropriate bump after receiving 2 units of blood yesterday. Full hemolysis labs and peripheral smear are pending, and a CT abdomen was negative for intrabdominal or retroperitoneal bleed. Hemolysis labs and peripheral smear will be followed up.

The patient's rash has been stable, with ecchymoses since yesterday. A porph"
