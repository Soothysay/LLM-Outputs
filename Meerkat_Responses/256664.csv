   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, RAS, transferred for IMI found to
   have RCA occlusion and hemodynamics c/w RV infarct
   # CORONARIES:  Mild disease of LMCA and distal LAD with some diffuse
   disease of LCX.  RCA ostium could not be found, but given collaterals,
   likely subacute to chronic lesion. given time since onset of symptoms,
   thrombolysis unlikely to be beneficial.  Received significant dye load,
   unable to do intervention.
   - consider repeat angiography in a few days to re-examine RCA
   - ASA, statin, plavix
   - hold heparin gtt for now
   - hold b-blocker and ca blocker given RV infarct and sinus bradycardia
   # PUMP:  RHC with pressures c/w RV infarct physiology; echo also c/w RV
   infarct.  Preload dependant
   - no nitro, no lasix
   - rcvd IVFs; can bolus PRN for hypotension
   - cont dobutamine, attempt to wean as tolerated for goal SBP 120-150
   # RHYTHM:  sinus bradycardia; no AV conduction evidence on ECG
   - hold b-blocker and ca blocker for now
   - atropine at bedside given risk of sinus arrest and AV nodal
   dysfunction with RCA lesions
   - consider [**Hospital1 **] pads or internal pacing wires if significant
   bradycardia present
   # Hypertension: hold home meds for now
   - on dobutamine as above
   # Hyperlipidemia: increase pravastatin to 80 mg daily in acute MI
   setting
   # Renal Artery Stenosis: PCP ordered CTA to eval renal arteries given
   significant HTN difficult to control.  CTA with high grade stenosis of
   proximal left renal artery and less severe on proximal right
   - if considering repeat cath, can also do angiography of renal arteries
   and consider stenting
   - would avoid ACE in the setting of bilateral RAS
   FEN: NPO for now; cardiac diet in AM if no repeat angiography
   ACCESS: PIV's; femoral venous and arterial lines; will remove arterial
   line once ACT decreased

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis. He was transferred to the ICU for an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) and found to have occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) with hemodynamics consistent with a right ventricular (RV) infarct. The patient has been on dobutamine overnight. 

In the past 24 hours, the patient underwent sheath, Cordis/ introducer, and PA catheter insertion. Allergies include no known drug allergies, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is currently receiving dobutamine at a rate of 0.5 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications and routine medications are also being administered.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except as noted below. The patient's vital signs remain stable with a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 60 bpm (normal range: 50-60 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 153/88 mmHg to 105/51 mmHg (normal range: 105-139/67-102 mmHg), respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute (normal range: 15-28 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, RAS, transferred for IMI found to
   have RCA occlusion and hemodynamics c/w RV infarct
   # CORONARIES:  Mild disease of LMCA and distal LAD with some diffuse
   disease of LCX.  RCA ostium could not be found, but given collaterals,
   likely subacute to chronic lesion. given time since onset of symptoms,
   thrombolysis unlikely to be beneficial.  Received significant dye load,
   unable to do intervention.   Will continue medical management.
   - Continue ASA, statin, and plavix
   - Can consider a CTA of his coronary arteries to visualize his RCA.
   - Hold b-blocker and ca blocker given RV infarct and sinus bradycardia
   # PUMP:  RHC with pressures c/w RV infarct physiology; echo also c/w RV
   infarct.  Preload dependant
   - Avoid preload reducers such as nitro orlasix
   - Patient
s CVP is at 18, no need for IVF currently.
   - Will wean his dobutamine as his CI is 4.2 today, with a goal CI
   between [**1-24**].
   - TTE today to evaluate his heart function.
   # RHYTHM:  sinus bradycardia; no AV conduction evidence on ECG
   - Continue to hold AV nodal agents for now
   - atropine at bedside given risk of sinus arrest and AV nodal
   dysfunction with RCA lesions
   - consider [**Hospital1 **] pads or internal pacing wires if significant
   bradycardia present
   # Hypertension: Hold home meds for now; Dobutamine is being weaned off
   today.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue increased pravastatin of 80 mg daily in
   acute MI setting
   # Renal Artery Stenosis: PCP ordered CTA to eval renal arteries given
   significant HTN difficult to control.  CTA with high grade stenosis of
   proximal left renal artery and less severe on proximal right
   - if considering repeat cath, can also do angiography of renal arteries
   and consider stenting
   - Avoid ACE in the setting of bilateral RAS
   FEN: NPO for now; cardiac diet in AM if no repeat angiography
   ACCESS: PIV's; femoral venous line
 can remove today as he no longer
   needs hemodynamic monitoring

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) with right ventricular involvement. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). Due to the significant dye load, intervention was not performed, and the patient will continue with medical management.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 100.9°F, blood pressure of 133/75 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm without murmurs, well-perfused extremities with mild bilateral edema, and neurologic examination showing alertness and orientation.

Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin-T levels, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal white blood cell count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated potassium and low magnesium. The assessment plan includes continuing aspirin, statin, and Plavix, considering a coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to visualize the RCA, and holding beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers due to right ventricular infarction and sinus bradycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, RAS, transferred for IMI found to
   have RCA occlusion and hemodynamics c/w RV infarct
   # CORONARIES:  Mild disease of LMCA and distal LAD with some diffuse
   disease of LCX.  RCA ostium could not be found, but given collaterals,
   likely subacute to chronic lesion. given time since onset of symptoms,
   thrombolysis unlikely to be beneficial.  Received significant dye load,
   unable to do intervention.   Will continue medical management.
   - Continue ASA, statin, and plavix
   - Can consider a CTA of his coronary arteries to visualize his RCA.
   - Hold b-blocker and ca blocker given RV infarct and sinus bradycardia
   # PUMP:  RHC with pressures c/w RV infarct physiology; echo also c/w RV
   infarct.  Preload dependant
   - Avoid preload reducers such as nitro orlasix
   - Patient
s CVP is at 18, no need for IVF currently.
   - Will wean his dobutamine as his CI is 4.2 today, with a goal CI
   between [**1-24**].
   - TTE today to evaluate his heart function.
   # RHYTHM:  sinus bradycardia; no AV conduction evidence on ECG
   - Continue to hold AV nodal agents for now
   - atropine at bedside given risk of sinus arrest and AV nodal
   dysfunction with RCA lesions
   - consider [**Hospital1 **] pads or internal pacing wires if significant
   bradycardia present
   # Hypertension: Hold home meds for now; Dobutamine is being weaned off
   today.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue increased pravastatin of 80 mg daily in
   acute MI setting
   # Renal Artery Stenosis: PCP ordered CTA to eval renal arteries given
   significant HTN difficult to control.  CTA with high grade stenosis of
   proximal left renal artery and less severe on proximal right
   - if considering repeat cath, can also do angiography of renal arteries
   and consider stenting
   - Avoid ACE in the setting of bilateral RAS
   FEN: NPO for now; cardiac diet in AM if no repeat angiography
   ACCESS: PIV's; femoral venous line
 can remove today as he no longer
   needs hemodynamic monitoring

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis. He was admitted to the ICU due to an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) with right ventricular involvement. The patient's initial presentation included recurrent chest pain with inspiration, negative cardiac enzymes, and symptoms of nausea. He received dobutamine, which was later weaned off, and a femoral line was pulled. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and had cultures sent due to fever.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.3°C (100.9°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm (normal range: 61-74 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 133/75 mmHg (normal range: 115-166/60-104 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 26 breaths per minute (normal range: 16-32 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 96% on nasal cannula

The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and his central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg (normal range: 10-20 mmHg). Other hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary artery pressures (PAP), cardiac output (CO), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) are within normal limits. The patient has received a total of 964 mL of"

He was transferred to the ICU for an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and was found to have occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) with hemodynamics consistent with right ventricular (RV) infarct.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F) at one point, but it defervesced without intervention. His blood pressure is stable, with readings ranging from 124/70 mmHg to 159/84 mmHg. The heart rate is within normal limits, ranging from 62 to 74 beats per minute. Respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 93%.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and no murmurs or gallops. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Extremities are warm and well-perfused, with trace nonpitting edema present bilaterally. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is alert and oriented x3, with a grossly nonfocal neuro exam.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, renal artery stenosis, and a recent inferior myocardial infarction (MI) that revealed occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) and hemodynamics consistent with right ventricular (RV) infarct. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Upon admission, the patient received a bolus of 250 mL and started on intravenous fluids (IVF) at a rate of 100 cc/hr, with urine output (U/O) improving to approximately 50 cc/hr. Blood pressures (BPs) remained stable, and central venous pressure (CVP) trended down from 1590 to 1205. Mean arterial blood pressure (MB) decreased from 50 to 34. Another 500 cc bolus was given with NS at a rate of 150 cc/hr. U/O ranged from 20-100/hr, and the patient remained asymptomatic. The patient received another 250 cc bolus overnight and continued with NS at 100 cc/hr. The patient's temperature spiked to 100.6 degrees Fahrenheit overnight but defervesced without intervention.

The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or other complaints this morning. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs as of [**2136-10-26**] 04:57 AM are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 degrees Fahrenheit)
- Tcurrent: 36.5 degrees Celsius (97.7 degrees Fahrenheit)

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 64-year-old male patient with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis.
- Transferred to the ICU for inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and found to have occlusion in the right coronary artery (RCA) with hemodynamics consistent with right ventricular infarct.
- Initial vital signs included fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and respiratory rate within normal range.
- Patient received a bolus of 250cc and started on IV fluids at 100cc/hr, leading to an increase in urine output.
- Another bolus of 500cc was given along with 150cc/hr normal saline.
- Patient remained asymptomatic and had a transient spike in temperature overnight, which defervesced without intervention.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Infusions: Heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- Other medications: Aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel continued; beta-blocker and calcium channel blocker held due to right ventricular infarct and sinus bradycardia.
- Review of systems: Unchanged from admission except as noted below.
- Flow sheet data as of 10/26/2136:
  - Vital signs: Max temperature 38.1°C (100.6°F), current temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate 66 bpm, blood pressure 124/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 93%.
  - Hemodynamic monitoring: Sinus rhythm, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and right atrial pressure.
  - Fluid balance: Total input 2,370 mL, total output 772 mL, urine output ranging from 20-100 cc/hr.
  - Respiratory support: None required, oxygen delivery device not in use.
  - Physical examination: Middle-aged male lying in bed, alert and oriented x3, neuro exam nonfocal, cardiovascular examination consistent with right ventricular infarct, chest clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally, abdomen soft and non-tender, extremities warm and well-perfused with trace nonpitting edema present bilaterally.
  - Labs/Radiology: Troponin-T levels decreasing, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen within normal range, leukocyte count within normal range, platelet count stable, electrolyte levels within normal range, arterial blood gas analysis pending.
  - Other findings: ECG showing no evidence of AV nodal conduction abnormalities, echocardiogram consistent with right ventricular infarct and reduced ejection fraction.
  
Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Ventricular Infarct: The patient has evidence of right ventricular infarct, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure and oxygen saturation, is essential to prevent further complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's urine output has been low, indicating the possibility of acute kidney injury. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid management accordingly is crucial to prevent worsening renal function.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient's history of RCA occlusion increases the risk of arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Continuous cardiac monitoring and prompt intervention in case of arrhythmias are necessary.
4. Infection: The patient's transient fever suggests a potential infection. Monitoring temperature trends and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be required to prevent or treat any infection.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: Immobilization and decreased mobility in the ICU increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin or mechanical compression devices should be implemented."

   Assessment and Plan
   64 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, RAS, transferred for IMI found to
   have RCA occlusion and hemodynamics c/w RV infarct
   # CORONARIES:  Mild disease of LMCA and distal LAD with some diffuse
   disease of LCX.  RCA ostium could not be found, but given collaterals,
   likely subacute to chronic lesion.  Received significant dye load,
   unable to do intervention.   Will continue medical management.  CT of
   coronaries can be done as outpatient.
   - Continue ASA, statin, and plavix
   - Holding b-blocker and ca blocker given RV infarct and sinus
   bradycardia
   - PT consult
   # PUMP:  RHC with pressures c/w RV infarct physiology; echo also c/w RV
   infarct.  Preload dependent.  RV function slightly improved overnight,
   LVEF 45-50%.  The patient had been requiring IV fluids for low uop, now
   stopped and uop is ~30cc/hr.  Creatinine is improving. Pt taking
   adequate PO intake.  Pt is requiring oxygen this morning, will attempt
   to wean.  Feels short of breath when walking to bathroom.
   - Hold ACE (given renal artery stenosis) and Lasix for now until his
   urine output is stable off IVF
   - Hold B-blocker as above.
   # RHYTHM:  The patient has been in nl sinus rhythm in the 60
s on tele.
   - Continue to hold AV nodal agents for now
   - atropine at bedside given risk of sinus arrest and AV nodal
   dysfunction with RCA lesions
   # Hypertension: Hold home meds for now and continue to monitor.
   # Hyperlipidemia: Continue increased pravastatin of 80 mg daily in
   acute MI setting
   # Renal Artery Stenosis: PCP ordered CTA to eval renal arteries given
   significant HTN difficult to control.  CTA with high grade stenosis of
   proximal left renal artery and less severe on proximal right.  Not
   considering repeat cath for now, as pt RV improving.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of bilateral RAS

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis. He was transferred to the ICU for an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and was found to have occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) with hemodynamics consistent with a right ventricular (RV) infarct. The patient received significant dye load and could not undergo intervention; therefore, he will continue with medical management. The patient's condition has improved overnight, with slightly improved RV function and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45-50%. He required oxygen supplementation but is being weaned off it. The patient's urine output has improved, and his creatinine levels are decreasing. He is taking adequate oral intake, but his blood pressure remains high. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for shortness of breath when walking to the bathroom. Physical examination shows a patient in no acute distress, with warm and well-perfused extremities, trace nonpitting edema, and alert and oriented psychiatically. Laboratory results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes, with a peak troponin T level of 3.70, and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's blood cultures are pending. Potential complications that can arise include further deterioration of RV function, worsening heart failure, development of arrhythmias, and potential renal dysfunction."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and renal artery stenosis who presented with an inferior myocardial infarction (IMI) and right ventricular (RV) infarct. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed mild disease of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and distal left anterior descending artery (LAD), diffuse disease of the left circumflex artery (LCX), and an occluded right coronary artery (RCA) with subacute to chronic lesion. Due to the time since onset of symptoms and the presence of collaterals, thrombolysis was deemed unlikely to be beneficial. The patient received significant dye load, and intervention was unable to be performed. The patient will continue with medical management.

The patient's RV function has slightly improved overnight, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 45-50%. The patient has been bolused with fluids, resulting in increasing urine output. As the patient is now starting to have increased oral intake, his intravenous fluids (IVFs) will be held for now and followed with urine output monitoring. ACE inhibitors will be held due to bilateral renal artery stenosis, and diuretics will be held until urine output is stable off IVF.

The patient's sinus bradycardia and AV nodal dysfunction will be managed by holding beta-blockers and continuing to monitor. Atrop"
