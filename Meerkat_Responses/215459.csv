   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. The patient has an ongoing gastrointestinal bleed, as indicated by melena (black, tarry stools), and renal failure. The gastrointestinal bleed may require further investigation and management to determine the source and control the bleeding. Renal failure is evident from the elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output.

The patient is receiving various medications, including octreotide, pantoprazole, fentanyl, and midazolam. Octreotide is a medication used to control bleeding in certain conditions like variceal bleeding. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor used to reduce stomach acid production and may be helpful in managing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Fentanyl is a pain medication, and midazolam is a sedative.

Vital signs show the patient to be hemodynamically stable with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/55 mmHg to 138/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation, which can sometimes be associated with cardiac issues or other systemic conditions.

Fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake-output balance, indicating fluid overload. This could contribute to worsening renal function. The patient's electrolytes are relatively within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated potassium level.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who
   presents with black stool and anemia.
   .
   # Black stool and anemia: Rectal demonstrates melena suggestive of
   acute upper GI bleed. Most likely secondary to varices or gastritis as
   demonstrated on recent EGD. Patient currently hypotensive which is
   concerning for significant varicial bleed.
   Central line placed, EGD performed, transfused 3 units, octreotide
   d/c
d and CTX prophylaxis started
   - HCT q6hr today
   - Hold Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to acute upper GI bleed. Less
   likely is sepsis physiology vs cardiogenic shock vs nadolol toxicity.
   No elevated WBC, fever, elevated RR to suggest SIRS. No evidence on
   physical exam to suggest cardiogenic shock. No bradycardia to suggest
   nadolol toxicity, but medication is renally cleared.
   - F/U urine culture, blood cultures
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat GI bleed as above
   - consider glucagon for B-blocker toxicity if patient not actively
   bleeding on scope or becomes bradycardiac
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated following cath on [**2106-1-1**]
   ranging from 1.6 - 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**] creatinine acutely worsened to
   3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast. Unclear what is
   causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad differential
   including ATN, poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal syndrome. Worsened
   at 4.2 today.
   - Send urine lytes
   - Renal u/s to r/o obstruction
   - Hold diuretics
   - Consult renal in am
   - Per liver start treatment for hepatorenal syndrome: albumin 1
   gram/kg, octreotide 100 Q8, Midodrine 7.5 TID
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   .
   # CAD: No chest pain.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia
   - Hold ASA
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today
   with confirmed varices
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3.
   - Liver team to follow
   - Treat possible hepatorenal syndrome as above.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: central line
   # Communication: Patient and husband
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. The patient presents with black stool and anemia, suggestive of an acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The most likely source of the bleed is varices or gastritis, as shown on the recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

The patient is currently hypotensive, which is concerning for a significant variceal bleed. Central line placement, EGD, transfusion of three units, and octreotide discontinuation have been performed. Prophylactic antibiotics have also been started.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. Black stool and anemia: The patient's black stool and anemia are likely due to the acute upper GI bleed, most likely secondary to varices or gastritis. Treatment includes central line placement, EGD, transfusion, octreotide discontinuation, and prophylactic antibiotics.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is most likely secondary to the acute upper GI bleed. Other less likely causes include sepsis physiology, cardiogenic shock, or nadolol toxicity. No signs of sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or nadolol toxicity have been observed. Follow-up urine and blood cultures should be done, and cardiac enzymes should"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who
   presents with black stool and anemia.
   .
   # Black stool and anemia: Rectal demonstrates melena suggestive of
   acute upper GI bleed. Most likely secondary to varices or gastritis as
   demonstrated on recent EGD. Patient currently hypotensive which is
   concerning for significant varicial bleed.
   Central line placed, EGD performed, transfused 3 units, octreotide
   d/c
d and CTX prophylaxis started
   - HCT q6hr today
   - Hold Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone
   .
   # Hypotension: Most likely secondary to acute upper GI bleed. Less
   likely is sepsis physiology vs cardiogenic shock vs nadolol toxicity.
   No elevated WBC, fever, elevated RR to suggest SIRS. No evidence on
   physical exam to suggest cardiogenic shock. No bradycardia to suggest
   nadolol toxicity, but medication is renally cleared.
   - F/U urine culture, blood cultures
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   - treat GI bleed as above
   - consider glucagon for B-blocker toxicity if patient not actively
   bleeding on scope or becomes bradycardiac
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated following cath on [**2106-1-1**]
   ranging from 1.6 - 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**] creatinine acutely worsened to
   3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast. Unclear what is
   causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad differential
   including ATN, poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal syndrome. Worsened
   at 4.2 today.
   - Send urine lytes
   - Renal u/s to r/o obstruction
   - Hold diuretics
   - Consult renal in am
   - Per liver start treatment for hepatorenal syndrome: albumin 1
   gram/kg, octreotide 100 Q8, Midodrine 7.5 TID
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   .
   # CAD: No chest pain.
   - Trend cardiac enzymes
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia
   - Hold ASA
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today
   with confirmed varices
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3.
   - Liver team to follow
   - Treat possible hepatorenal syndrome as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The patient presented with black stool and anemia, which are suggestive of an acute upper GI bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed multiple lumens, grade III varices, no active bleeding but slow ooze, and portal hypertension gastropathy. Three bands were placed during the procedure. The patient was started on octreotide, sloughing agents, and broad-spectrum antibiotics prophylaxis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate (HR) of 78 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 99/55 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count (Plt) of 274 K/uL. Kidney function tests reveal a creatinine level of 3.9 mg/dL, indicating acute renal failure. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination is notable for the absence of peripheral pulses, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment due to being intubated and sedated. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Black stool and anemia: Most likely secondary to varices or gastritis as demonstrated on recent EGD. The patient is currently hypotensive, which is concerning for significant variceal bleed.
2. Hypotension: Most likely secondary to acute upper GI bleed. Less likely is sepsis physiology vs cardiogenic shock vs nadolol toxicity.
3. Acute renal failure: Creatinine elevated following catheterization on [**2106-1-1**], ranging from 1.6 to 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**], creatinine acutely worsened to 3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast. Unclear what is causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad differential including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Diabetes: Hold metformin.
5. CAD: No chest pain. Trend cardiac enzymes. Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia. Hold ASA.
6. Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled. Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today with confirmed varices.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a chief complaint of shock and acute renal failure. She has a history of cirrhosis and underwent banding for varices, but without signs of active bleeding. The patient's presentation is perplexing, with a broad differential diagnosis. There are no clear signs of infection, but her troponin levels are elevated. The plan includes checking the central venous pressure (CVP), performing an echocardiogram, administering albumin for volume expansion as needed, discussing the use of octreotide/midodrine with liver and renal teams, consulting with the renal team, checking urine studies, and following up on a renal ultrasound. Repeat EKG and echo are also recommended. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, some potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac involvement, such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
2. Kidney injury: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may lead to further deterioration of kidney function if not properly managed.
3. Liver decompensation: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of liver decompensation and subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy or hepatorenal syndrome.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient may be at an increased risk of bleeding due to liver"

   Assessment and Plan: 69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who
   presents with black stool and anemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology remains unclear. Sepsis and cardiogenic shock
   unlikely, as is SIRS. Cortisol stimulation test ruled out adrenal
   insufficiency. Possible med toxicity from nadolol in setting of
   worsening renal function. Also possible is hepatorenal syndrome per
   Hepatology team.  Was able to wean off pressors yesterday. Does drop
   her blood pressures when she lies on her sides while sleeping.
   - Lasix trial today given possibility that patient is mainly
   significantly volume overloaded causing heart strain and subsequent
   hypotension
   - F/U urine culture, blood cultures
   - Continue treatment for Hepatorenal Syndrome with Octreotide,
   Midodrine (diagnosis of exclusion, though); hold on Albumin
   - Will recheck CVP today
   # Black stool and anemia: Central line placed, EGD performed suggestive
   of possibly slow oozing from portal hypertension gastropathy and
   varices, transfused 3 units, octreotide d/c
d and CTX prophylaxis
   started yesterday.
   - Hold Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone
   .
   # Acute renal failure/hyperkalemia: Creatinine elevated following cath
   on [**2106-1-1**] ranging from 1.6 - 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**] creatinine acutely
   worsened to 3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast.
   Unclear what is causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad
   differential including ATN, poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal
   syndrome. Worsened at 4.2 today.
   - Follow-up renal recs
 may need dialysis
   - Recheck K this morning
   - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - Per Hepatology, continue treatment for hepatorenal syndrome:
   octreotide 100 Q8, Midodrine 7.5 TID; hold on Albumin
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   .
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes slowly drifted down yesterday,
   stably elevated. Likely in setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia
   - Hold ASA
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today
   with confirmed varices
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3.
   - Liver team to follow
   - Treat possible hepatorenal syndrome as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and cirrhosis. She presents with black stool and anemia, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hypotension remains unclear, with potential causes including sepsis, cardiogenic shock, medication toxicity, and hepatorenal syndrome. The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy from a previous catheterization, as well as worsening renal function. Her cardiac enzymes are stable but elevated, suggesting ongoing myocardial injury. She also has atrial fibrillation, which is currently being rate-controlled. The patient's liver function tests and coagulation profile are stable, indicating no immediate liver decompensation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient presents with black stool and anemia, suggesting ongoing upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This may be due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Octreotide has been started to reduce portal blood flow, and endoscopic treatment is planned.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to contrast-induced nephropathy from a previous catheterization. The worsening renal function may be attributed to several factors, including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), poor forward perfusion, or hepatorenal syndrome. Close monitoring of electrolytes and creatinine levels is essential, and dialysis may be required if necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who presents with black stool
   and anemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology remains unclear. Sepsis and cardiogenic shock
   unlikely, as is SIRS. Cortisol stimulation test ruled out adrenal
   insufficiency. Possible med toxicity from nadolol in setting of
   worsening renal function. Also possible is hepatorenal syndrome per
   Hepatology team.  Was able to wean off pressors yesterday, back on
   yesterday. Does drop her blood pressures when she lies on her sides
   while sleeping. Did not respond to lasix trial yesterday
 no urine
   output.
   - Started hemodialysis yesterday for volume overload causing heart
   strain and subsequent hypotension
   - F/U urine culture, blood cultures
   - Continue treatment for Hepatorenal Syndrome with Octreotide,
   Midodrine (diagnosis of exclusion, though); holding on Albumin
   - Will recheck CVP today
   .
   # Acute renal failure/hyperkalemia: Creatinine elevated following cath
   on [**2106-1-1**] ranging from 1.6 - 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**] creatinine acutely
   worsened to 3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast.
   Unclear what is causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad
   differential including ATN, poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal
   syndrome. Worsened at 4.2 yesterday.
   - Started CVVHD overnight
    - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - Per Hepatology, continue treatment for hepatorenal syndrome:
   octreotide 100 Q8, Midodrine 7.5 TID; hold on Albumin
   .
   # Black stool and anemia: Central line placed, EGD performed suggestive
   of possibly slow oozing from portal hypertension gastropathy and
   varices, transfused 3 units, octreotide d/c
d and CTX prophylaxis
   started yesterday.
   - Hold Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   .
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes slowly drifted down yesterday,
   stably elevated. Likely in setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia
   - Hold ASA
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today
   with confirmed varices
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3.
   - Liver team to follow
   - Treat possible hepatorenal syndrome as above.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, clears
 advanced as tolerated (low
   potassium, renal diet)
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   # Access: central line. A line, peripheral IVs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. The patient presented with black stool and anemia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Hypotension: The etiology of the patient's hypotension remains unclear. Sepsis and cardiogenic shock are unlikely, as well as Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). A cortisol stimulation test ruled out adrenal insufficiency. Possible causes include medication toxicity from nadolol in the setting of worsening renal function or hepatorenal syndrome per Hepatology team. The patient was able to wean off pressors yesterday but had to be put back on them yesterday. She experiences a drop in blood pressures when lying on her sides while sleeping and did not respond to a Lasix trial yesterday with no urine output.

2. Acute renal failure/hyperkalemia: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated since [**2106-1-1**] ranging from 1.6-2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**], creatinine acutely worsened to 3.9. The initial insult was likely from cath contrast. The recent worsening of renal failure is unclear, with a broad differential including acute tubular necrosis ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), new-onset cirrhosis, elevated CA 125 level, nonvisualized ovaries on CT or US, and a 2.5 cm hypoechoic pelvic mass consistent with fibroid or ovarian pathology. She presented in 2965 with new-onset atrial fibrillation, NSTEMI, new cirrhosis, elevated CA 125 level, nonvisualized ovaries on CT or US, and a 2.5 cm hypoechoic pelvic mass consistent with fibroid or ovarian pathology. The patient's current presentation is consistent with hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), specifically pressor dependence, sodium retention (< 10 mEq/L in 2 spot check), acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis. In this case, the patient's presentation is consistent with HRS, characterized by sodium retention, pressor dependence, and acute renal failure.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is receiving non-invasive ventilation and has a low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 88%), indicating potential respiratory distress. ARDS is a possibility given the patient's respiratory status and underlying liver"

   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who presents with black stool
   and anemia.
   .
   # Hypotension: Etiology remains unclear. Sepsis and cardiogenic shock
   unlikely, as is SIRS. Cortisol stimulation test ruled out adrenal
   insufficiency. Possible med toxicity from nadolol in setting of
   worsening renal function. Also possible is hepatorenal syndrome per
   Hepatology team.  Was able to wean off pressors yesterday, back on
   yesterday. Does drop her blood pressures when she lies on her sides
   while sleeping. Did not respond to lasix trial yesterday
 no urine
   output.
   - Started hemodialysis yesterday for volume overload causing heart
   strain and subsequent hypotension
   - F/U urine culture, blood cultures
   - Continue treatment for Hepatorenal Syndrome with Octreotide,
   Midodrine (diagnosis of exclusion, though); holding on Albumin
   - Will recheck CVP today
   - V/Q scan to r/o PE
   - Wean pressors as tolerated
   .
   # Acute renal failure/hyperkalemia: Creatinine elevated following cath
   on [**2106-1-1**] ranging from 1.6 - 2.5. Since [**2107-1-24**] creatinine acutely
   worsened to 3.9. Most likely initial insult was from cath contrast.
   Unclear what is causing recent worsening of renal failure - broad
   differential including ATN, poor forward perfusion, hepatorenal
   syndrome. Worsened at 4.2 yesterday.
   - Started CVVHD overnight
    - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - Per Hepatology, continue treatment for hepatorenal syndrome:
   octreotide 100 Q8, Midodrine 7.5 TID; hold on Albumin
   .
   # Black stool and anemia: Central line placed, EGD performed suggestive
   of possibly slow oozing from portal hypertension gastropathy and
   varices, transfused 3 units, octreotide d/c
d and CTX prophylaxis
   started yesterday.
   - Hold Aspirin, Nadolol, Lasix, ACE, Spironolactone
   .
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   .
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes slowly drifted down yesterday,
   stably elevated. Likely in setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue Atorvastatin 20 mg for hyperlipidemia
   - Hold ASA
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting today
   with confirmed varices
   .
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3.
   - Liver team to follow
   - Treat possible hepatorenal syndrome as above.
   .
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, clears
 advanced as tolerated (low
   potassium, renal diet)

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and anemia. She presented with black stool and was found to have an acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely due to portal hypertension-related gastropathy and varices. She also has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly secondary to hepatorenal syndrome, and is on hemodialysis for volume overload. Other complications include hypotension of unclear etiology, atrial fibrillation, and atrioventricular block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's cirrhosis and renal failure suggest the possibility of hepatorenal syndrome. This condition can worsen if not treated promptly.
2. GI bleed: The patient has experienced a significant GI bleed, which may require ongoing monitoring and intervention to prevent further bleeding.
3. ARF: The patient's renal function is compromised, leading to the need for hemodialysis. It is important to monitor her electrolyte levels and adjust treatment accordingly.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite the use of vasopressors, indicating potential ongoing issues with blood pressure regulation.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is unstable, and she requires rate control measures.
6. DNR status: The patient has designated herself as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has multiple comorbidities and complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's V/Q scan shows intermediate probability of PE, which indicates a possible presence of clots in the pulmonary arteries. This condition can lead to decreased oxygenation and respiratory distress.
2. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS): Given the patient's worsening renal function and history of cirrhosis, HRS should be considered. HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of recently banded esophageal varices, which are at risk for bleeding. Anticoagulation therapy should be avoided due to the high risk of bleeding from these varices.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension requires further investigation to determine the underlying cause. Possible causes include sepsis, cardiogenic shock, or volume overload.
5. Black stool and anemia: The presence of black stool suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly from portal hypertension gastrop"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, and a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she has an intermediate probability V/Q scan indicating possible pulmonary embolism. Anticoagulation is contraindicated due to her banded esophageal varices. The patient also has black stool and anemia, suggesting possible gastrointestinal bleeding from portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. She is on multiple medications, including anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, and diuretics. The patient's condition includes hypotension, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient's intermediate probability V/Q scan suggests a possible pulmonary embolism. However, anticoagulation is contraindicated due to her banded esophageal varices. Alternative measures such as lower extremity Doppler or an inferior vena cava filter may be considered.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's black stool and anemia indicate gastrointestinal bleeding, likely due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. This condition requires close monitoring, and measures should be taken to prevent further bleeding.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are shock, acute renal failure (ARF), and cirrhosis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has undergone several interventions and treatments.

From the note, it can be summarized that the patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, antacids, and others for different conditions. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/52 mmHg to 89/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's temperature is within normal range. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are overweight/obese, with clear breath sounds and right and left lower extremity edema. The neurologic examination shows that the patient responds to verbal stimuli and has normal muscle tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased creatinine and potassium levels. Other lab values are within normal limits or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's imaging shows an intermediate probability of ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o woman with
          Shock
          Acute renal failure
          Cirrhosis
          Varices s/p banding but without signs of active bleeding
          Respiratory acidosis
          Volume overload
          Cor pulmonale
   Shock
          Empiric ABX while awaiting cultures (stop on Monday if cx
   negative). Does not seem infected.
          If no progress or worsens can consider PA catheterization
          Overall, she
s improved and we were again able to stop
   pressors this morning.  Given that this has occurred in the setting of
   CVVH and fall in CVP, I suspect that her volume overload resulted in
   ventricular dilation putting her on the wrong end of the Starling
   Curve.  As CVP has fallen, pressor dose decreased and UOP has
   increased.  Continue CVVHD for volume removal
   [image004.gif]
   Acidosis
          Respiratory acidosis has improved/stabilized off NIMV
   ARF
          Likely ATN; seems less likely HRS but possible.
          CVVHD
   Abnormal VQ scan
          We did the VQ to exclude very large PE, which could cause
   both shock and high pCO2 (via increased Vd/Vt).  If we had found that,
   would have been reasonable to discuss catheter-based thrombectomy.
          However, intermediate VQ is not consistent with truly
   massive PE.  Since she is extraordinarily high risk for hemorrhage from
   recently banded varices, would not anticoagulate in this setting.
          Will check LE Dopplers and if (+) consider IVC filter.
   Code status
   She would not wish for CPR/defibrillation in the event of pulseless
   arrest. If intubated, would want a time-limited trial of ventilation.
   Otherwise, aggressive care.
   Discussed with husband, son, and patient.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, dyspnea, black stool, and microcytic anemia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 4.8, indicating a significant decline in kidney function. She is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD). Monitoring electrolytes and creatinine levels will be important to assess the progression of AKI and guide further management.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite being off pressors for 24 hours. Possible positional element, sepsis, and cardiogenic shock have been ruled out. Significant third spacing and potential volume overload due to acute respiratory failure (ARF) should also be considered. Continuous monitoring of the patient's blood pressure is essential to detect any changes or deterioration.

3. Black stool and microcytic anemia: The patient's gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is suspected to be caused by portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. This is further supported by the findings from an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD"

   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who p/w anemia, hypotension,
   worsening renal failure.
   # Dyspnea: Continues to speak in abbreviated sentences, but saturating
   well on room air, ABG's consistently good, with mild hypercarbia. 1
   liter fluid successfully removed via CVVHD yesterday, on CCHD again
   today. Sub-optimal V/Q intermediate probability, but patient's
   comorbidities (i.e. recently banded esophageal varices) make her a poor
   candidate for anticoagulation. Lower extremities negative for DVT.
   Afebrile throughout admission; hypothermic < 96 x1, several days ago.
   Today is day 4 of vanco/zosyn for empiric treatment of HAP
   - Can discontinue Vanc/Zosyn tomorrow given lack of localizing symptoms
   concerning for pneumonia at this time and likely other etiologies for
   hypotension, dyspnea
   - Continue to monitor SpO2 and ABG's on room air
   - D/c ABx after tomorrow
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine peaked at 4.8, now on CVVH. On
   octreotide/midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.
   ~160 cc urine over 24 hrs yesterday.
   - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - Continue with octreotide/midodrine if consulting services believe
   will be of benefit
   - f/u liver, renal recs
   # Hypotension: BP stable off pressors x 24 hrs, while on CVVHD.
   Possible positional element (worse when on sides?) Sepsis and
   cardiogenic shock unlikely. Significant third spacing Could also have
   been volume overloaded [**1-18**] ARF. Lost arterial line
   - continue to monitor
   # Black stool and microcytic anemia: EGD revealing potential slow bleed
   from portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Hct stable. Would not
   anticoagulate at this time, in discussions with GI re: V/Q scan results
   - Hold Nadolol, ACE, Spironolactone
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes stably elevated. Likely in
   setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue ASA, Atorvastatin
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting if BP
   consistently stable

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, obesity, and hypoxemia. The patient presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding.

Assessment and plan:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has melena and a potential slow bleed from portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. EGD reveals evidence of bleeding, but anticoagulation is not recommended at this time.
2. Renal failure, acute: The patient's creatinine level peaked at 4.8, and she is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Octreotide and midodrine are being administered empirically for hepatorenal syndrome.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors for 24 hours while on CVVHD. Possible positional element and third spacing are considered, and sepsis and cardiogenic shock are unlikely.
4. Black stool and microcytic anemia: The patient has black stool and microcytic anemia due to bleeding from portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Hold nadolol, ACE inhibitors, and spironolactone.
5. Diabetes: Hold metformin, and use sliding scale insulin while in the house"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and anemia. She presents with hypotension, worsening renal failure, and dyspnea. The patient has been on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and is tolerating it well. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/59 mmHg to 135/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. She is currently not anticoagulated due to her bleeding risk.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but there is no specific treatment mentioned in the plan.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors for the past 48 hours while on CVVHD. It is possible that there is a positional element to her hypotension. Sepsis and cardiogenic shock are unlikely causes. Significant third spacing and volume overload are also considered possibilities. The plan is to continue monitoring the patient's blood pressure and continue with CVVHD.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 4.8 and she"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, dyspnea, acute kidney injury, cirrhosis, hypotension, black stool, microcytic anemia, diabetes, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her multiple medical conditions. She is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) due to acute kidney injury with a peak creatinine level of 4.8. The patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors while on CVVHD. Her liver function tests and coagulation profile are stable, but she is not a candidate for liver transplantation with a MELD score of 22.

The patient has ongoing issues related to her medical conditions, including dyspnea, potential pulmonary embolism (PE), black stool, microcytic anemia, diabetes, CAD, atrial fibrillation, and electrolyte imbalances. She is being closely monitored, and various interventions are being implemented to manage her conditions, such as CVVH, octreotide/midodrine for"

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and anemia. She presents with symptoms of dyspnea, hypotension, worsening renal function, and black stool. The patient's current condition includes acute kidney injury, cirrhosis, hypotension, and diabetes.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.4°C (95.8°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 61/52 mmHg to 57/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with calcium gluconate and potassium chloride.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. The patient also has elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid.

The patient's physical examination reveals right and left lower extremity edema, distended abdomen, and normal breath sounds. Neurological assessment shows attentive behavior, follow-up of simple commands, and response to verbal stimuli.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and a history of myocardial infarction. The patient presented with acute renal failure and gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to admission to the ICU. The patient has been receiving octreotide, midodrine, and albumin infusions. 

Vital signs show hypotension and hypothermia. The patient's heart rate is within normal limits, but he has an abnormal rhythm of atrial fibrillation. Oxygen saturation is good. The patient's weight has decreased from admission, and he has right and left lower extremity edema.

Fluid balance shows a significant positive fluid intake with a total input of 7,673 mL and an output of 10,301 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of -2,628 mL. The patient's urine output is low at 171 mL.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan include gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, type II diabetes mellitus, hypotension, liver cirrhosis, history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, dyslipidemia, hypoxemia, obesity, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who p/w anemia, hypotension,
   worsening renal failure.
   # Dyspnea: Speaking easily, denies problems, s/p 2.6 liters off this
   AM. Hypotension likely in setting of severe right heart
   strain/ventricular dilation from volume overload. Recent V/Q
   intermediate probability for PE but at high risk for bleeding with
   anticoagulation given liver disease, so holding on anticoagulation for
   now. Yesterday, discontinued Vanc / Zosyn for ?HAP and presumed sepsis
   given initial presentation of shock
   - Continue to monitor SpO2 and ABG's on room air; has known OSA
   - Continue to hold anticoagulation
   - Continue active hemodialysis (ultrafiltration yesterday and trial
   hemodialysis today)
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine peaked at 4.8, now on CVVH/UF/HD. On
   octreotide / midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.
   Minimal UOP.
   - Continue CVVHD/UF/HD
 will monitor progress on UF/HD
   - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - Continue with octreotide/midodrine
 will touch base with Hepatology
   today regarding benefits to continuing
   - F/u liver, renal recs
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable. Oriented X 3. MELD of 22 but not
   candidate for transplant currently secondary to BMI. Needs to lose 40
   pounds, likely a third or half of which is fluid. Also needs to
   decrease pulmonary hypertension (left heart failure).
   - Liver team to follow
 appreciate their recommendations
   - Continue to actively hemodialyze
   - Discuss weight loss options with patient
   - Elevated CA [**15**]-9 from previous admission also long-term follow-up as
   underlying malignancies can impact transplant candidacies
   # Hypotension: BP stable off pressors x 72 hrs, while on CVVHD/UF.
   Possible positional element (worse when on sides?) Sepsis and
   cardiogenic shock unlikely. Significant third spacing. Could also have
   been volume overloaded [**1-18**] ARF. Now off pressors X3 days
   - continue to monitor
   - Continue CVVHD/UF/HD
   # Black stool and microcytic anemia: EGD revealing potential slow bleed
   from portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Hct stable. Would not
   anticoagulate at this time, in discussions with GI re: V/Q scan
   results. Per nursing, continues to have soft, formed tarry stools
   - Guaiac stools to confirm slow GI bleed
   - Hold Nadolol, ACE, Spironolactone
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes stably elevated. Likely in
   setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue ASA, Atorvastatin
   # Atrial fibrillation: Currently rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting if BP
   consistently stable
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low potassium / renal / DM diet
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SCH, PPI
   # Access: central line. 20g PIV x1. Left IJ HD line
   # Communication: Patient and husband
   # Code:  DNR but please intubate (confirmed with patient)
   # Disposition: ICU on CVVH

- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis, and obesity. She presented with anemia, hypotension, and worsening renal failure.
- She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 61/52 mmHg and heart rate of 69 bpm. Her oxygen saturation is 98% on room air.
- She is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH/UF/HD) due to acute kidney injury. Her creatinine levels have improved from a peak of 4.8 to 1.8 mg/dL.
- The patient is also receiving octreotide and midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal syndrome.
- Her liver function tests and coagulation profile are stable, with a MELD score of 22. However, she is not a candidate for liver transplantation due to her high BMI.
- The patient has evidence of portal hypertension gastropathy and varices, as indicated by black stool and microcytic anemia. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed potential slow bleeding from these conditions.
- Her diabetes is being managed with a sliding scale insulin regimen while in the hospital.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, and volume overload. She is currently on dialysis and presents with tarry bowel movement (BM) yesterday.

The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension with a blood pressure of 65/52 mmHg, low heart rate (HR) of 80 bpm, decreased respiratory rate (RR) of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 93%. She is in atrial fibrillation (AF) rhythm. Her weight has decreased from 128.7 kg at admission to 120.5 kg currently. 

The patient has fluid overload with a total fluid input of 7,673 mL and output of 10,301 mL, resulting in a negative fluid balance of 2,628 mL. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 21 mmHg.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), lactulose, heparin subcutaneously three times a day, and others. She is also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with potassium chloride (KCl) and calcium gluconate infusions.

Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), renal failure, and volume overload. She is currently on dialysis and has had tarry stools yesterday. Her vital signs show hypotension and low oxygen saturation. She has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and her heart rhythm is irregular. Her weight is 120.5 kg, which is higher than her admission weight of 128.7 kg. She has right and left lower extremity edema. Her blood gases indicate a normal pH level but decreased oxygen saturation. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Her kidney function tests (creatinine, blood urea nitrogen) are elevated. Liver function tests are within normal range. Electrolyte levels are slightly imbalanced. Coagulation tests show prolonged PT and PTT with normal INR. 

The patient has multiple lines inserted, including a multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, and arterial line. She is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) with aggressive fluid removal and will undergo hemodialysis tomorrow. She is also receiving insulin sliding scale for glycemic control and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Her nutritional intake is via a per oral diet.

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who p/w anemia, hypotension,
   worsening renal failure.
   # Dyspnea: Continues to improve with further diuresis; likely due to
   massive fluid overload. 10 liters off with CVVH yesterday. Negative 14
   liters for LOS. Satting excellently on room air.
   - Continue to monitor SpO2 and ABG's on room air; has known OSA
   # Black stool and microcytic anemia: Hct stable. EGD revealed potential
   slow bleed [**1-18**] portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Avoiding
   anticoagulation per hepatology recs, given high risk for bleeding. Did
   have guaiac positive stool yesterday.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain adequate IV access, active type/screen
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine stabilized at 2.0 on CVVH after
   peaking at 4.8. On Midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal
   syndrome, not on Octreotide or Albumin at this time. Minimal UOP.
   - Continue CVVHD vs intermittent HD
   - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine
   - F/u renal recs
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable when last checked. Oriented X 3.
   Needs to have sufficiently low BMI for transplant candidacy; may be
   approaching this level with aggressive fluid removal. Also needs to
   decrease pulmonary hypertension (left heart failure).
   - Hepatology recs
   - Elevated CA 125 from previous admission also long-term follow-up as
   underlying malignancies can impact transplant candidacies
   # Hypotension: Off pressors x several days, while on CVVHD/UF. Possible
   positional element (worse when on sides?)
   - continue to monitor
   - Continue CVVHD/UF/HD
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house.
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes stably elevated. Likely in
   setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue ASA, Atorvastatin
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting if BP
   consistently stable
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low potassium / renal / DM diet
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SCH, PPI
   # Access: Right IJ CVL. Left radial line (draws only, BP measurements
   inaccurate). Left IJ HD line

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. She presents with anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, dyspnea, black stool, and microcytic anemia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have peaked at 4.8 and are currently stabilized at 2.0 on CVVH. She is at risk for further deterioration of renal function.
2. Bleeding: The patient has black stool and a potential slow bleed due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. She is at high risk for bleeding, especially considering the avoidance of anticoagulation.
3. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which may be positional and worsens when lying on her sides. Close monitoring is required.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's liver function tests (LFT) and coagulation profile are stable. However, she needs to achieve a sufficiently low body mass index (BMI) for transplant candidacy and decrease pulmonary hypertension (left heart failure).

   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o F DM, CAD recent NSTEMI, cirrhosis who p/w anemia, hypotension,
   worsening renal failure.
   # Dyspnea: Continues to improve with further diuresis; likely due to
   massive fluid overload. 10 liters off with CVVH yesterday. Negative 14
   liters for LOS, ~20kg LOS. Satting excellently on room air.
   - Continue to monitor SpO2 and ABG's on room air; has known OSA
   - Will continue CPAP when napping/sleeping overnight as tolerated
   # Black stool and microcytic anemia: Hct stable. EGD revealed potential
   slow bleed [**1-18**] portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Avoiding
   anticoagulation per hepatology recs, given high risk for bleeding. Did
   have guaiac positive stool yesterday.
   - Hct [**Hospital1 **]
   - maintain adequate IV access, active type/screen
   # Acute kidney injury: Creatinine stabilized at 2.0 on CVVH after
   peaking at 4.8. On Midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal
   syndrome, not on Octreotide or Albumin at this time. Minimal UOP.
   - Trialing HD this morning
   - Monitor electrolytes/creatinine; now on sliding scale for phosphate
   - F/u renal recs: patient needs daily HD
   # Cirrhosis: LFT and coags are stable when last checked. Oriented X 3.
   Needs to have sufficiently low BMI for transplant candidacy; may be
   approaching this level with aggressive fluid removal. Also needs to
   decrease pulmonary hypertension (left heart failure).
   - Hepatology recs
   - BMI now 38, therefore transplant candidate
   - Elevated CA 125 from previous admission also long-term follow-up as
   underlying malignancies can impact transplant candidacies
   # Hypotension: Off pressors x several days, while on CVVHD/UF. Possible
   positional element (worse when on sides?)
   - continue to monitor
   - Continue CVVHD/UF/HD
 trialing HD today
   # Diabetes: Hold metformin.
   - Sliding scale while in house with fixed dose started overnight
   (tolerated well yesterday)
   # CAD: No chest pain. Cardiac enzymes stably elevated. Likely in
   setting of renal failure and old NSTEMI
   - Continue ASA, Atorvastatin
   # Atrial fibrillation: Rate controlled.
   - Hold Nadolol in setting of acute bleed but consider restarting if BP
   consistently stable
   # FEN: replete electrolytes, low potassium / renal / DM diet
   # Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, SCH, PPI
   # Access: Right IJ CVL. Left radial line (draws only, BP measurements
   inaccurate). Left IJ HD line

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD) including a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and cirrhosis. The patient presents with anemia, hypotension, and worsening renal failure. The patient's condition has improved with diuresis and removal of fluid overload. The patient is experiencing dyspnea, which is likely due to massive fluid overload. The patient's oxygen saturation is excellent on room air.

The patient has black stool and microcytic anemia with a stable hematocrit (Hct) level. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed potential slow bleed due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. Anticoagulation is being avoided per hepatology recommendations due to the high risk for bleeding.

The patient has acute kidney injury with stabilized creatinine at 2.0 on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) after peaking at 4.8. The patient is on midodrine for empiric treatment of hepatorenal syndrome and is being trialed on hemodialysis (HD) today.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) and coagulation profile are stable. The patient needs to have a sufficiently low body mass index (BMI) for transplant candidacy and may be approaching this level with aggressive fluid removal. The patient also needs to decrease pulmonary"

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined Ms. [**Known lastname 6262**] with the ICU team, whose note from today
   reflects my input.  I would add/emphasize:
          Remains off pressors.
          Excellent volume removal with CVVHD
          Feels better
          Net weight is down 20kg !
   Exam:  mental status appears to continue to improve.  Heart regular
   with murmurs.  Decreased breath sounds at bases.  Protuberant abdomen.
   Labs and meds reviewed.
   Assessment and Plan
   69 y/o woman with
          Acute renal failure, likely ATN
          Cirrhosis
          Shock
 resolved
          Varices s/p banding but without signs of active bleeding
          Volume overload
 improving under treatment
          Cor pulmonale
   Shock
          Now off ABX
          Overall, she
s improved and we were able to stop pressors
   Saturday morning.  Given that this has occurred in the setting of CVVH
   and fall in CVP, I suspect that her volume overload resulted in
   ventricular dilation putting her on the wrong end of the Starling
   Curve.
   ARF
          Likely ATN; seems less likely HRS but possible.  Discuss
   octreotide/midodrine with hepatology and renal.
          I suspect that her volume overload resulted in ventricular
   dilation putting her on the wrong end of the Starling Curve.
          Trial of conversion to HD today.  Will need daily HD for
   volume removal for now.
   Episode of black stool
   Following clinically and with Hct. Stable for now.
   Code status
   She would not wish for CPR/defibrillation in the event of pulseless
   arrest. If intubated, would want a time-limited trial of ventilation.
   Otherwise, aggressive care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's conditions and potential medical complications:

1. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a known history of OSA, which is likely contributing to her hypoxemia.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleed (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB): The patient has experienced black stool and microcytic anemia. An endoscopy revealed potential slow bleeding due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices. There is a high risk of further bleeding, so anticoagulation has been avoided.

3. Renal Failure, Acute (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels have stabilized at 2.0 after peaking at 4.8. She is on continuous venovenous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and may require hemodialysis (HD) in the future. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a possibility, and the patient is being monitored for this condition.

4. Diabetes Mellitus (DM), Type II: The patient has diabetes, which needs to be managed with a sliding scale while in the hospital. Metformin has been held.

5. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient has been off pressors for several days but still experiences hypotension, particularly when in a lateral position. This could be due to volume overload and positional"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- She presents with symptoms of anemia, hypotension, worsening renal failure, dyspnea, black stool, and microcytic anemia.
- The patient has been on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight due to hypotension during sleep, with improved blood pressure when awakened.
- She has undergone hemodialysis (HD) yesterday and is scheduled for another session tomorrow, but renal recommendations suggest she may not tolerate HD due to hypotension.
- The patient has a tunneled line placed for future HD sessions.
- Her blood work shows elevated creatinine levels at 2.5 on HD, indicating acute kidney injury (AKI). She is also anuric, meaning no urine output.
- She is being treated empirically for hepatorenal syndrome with midodrine.
- The patient has black stool and microcytic anemia, and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed potential slow bleed, portal hypertension gastropathy, and varices. Anticoagulation is avoided due to the high risk of bleeding from banded varices.
- Her liver function tests (LFTs)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presents with hypotension, worsening renal function, anemia, and dyspnea. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experiences spells of low blood pressure while sleeping, which may be due to preload and afterload reduction caused by CPAP use. It is important to monitor and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.5 on hemodialysis (HD), indicating impaired kidney function. Anuria (no urine output) is also noted. Continued monitoring of electrolytes and creatinine levels is necessary, and a sliding scale for phosphate management should be implemented.
3. Black Stool and Microcytic Anemia: The patient has a positive guiac test for blood in the stool, along with microcytic anemia. This may be due to portal hypertension gastropathy and varices, as revealed by an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Avoiding anticoagulation is crucial to prevent further bleeding from the banded varices.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's INR is stable"
