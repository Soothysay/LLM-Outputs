","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to abdominal pain, right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to infection, intra-abdominal process, or medication effect. It has responded to intravenous fluids (IVF), so close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has high white blood cell count and consolidation seen on chest X-ray. Preliminary read on CT abdomen is not worrisome for acute abdominal abscess or other infectious process. Vancomycin has been continued for line coverage and HAP coverage. Blood and sputum cultures are pending.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient may have pseudo-obstruction, as indicated by distended colonic bowel loops. Other possible causes include sepsis, toxic megacolon, ischemic bowel. Measures to alleviate symptoms include manual disimpaction, OG tube placement, rectal tube, and aggressive electrolyte re"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, and hypotension. The patient has been experiencing various complications since admission, including hypotension, decreased mentation, respiratory distress, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count (WBC). She underwent several procedures such as dialysis catheter placement, arterial line placement, femoral line placement, endotracheal intubation, and bronchoscopy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's high WBC count, fever, and consolidation seen on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of an infection. The doctor suspects hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and has initiated appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Mesenteric ischemia: Although less likely given normal lactate levels and improvement with manual disimpaction, the patient's abdominal pain and distended bowel loops raise concerns for mesenteric ischemia.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. difficile): The patient is at high risk for C. difficile due to recent antibiotic use, and stool samples have been sent for testing.

   # Hypotension: persists; ddx includes infection (high risk given fever
   and WBC), intraabdominal process (given abd pain although relatively
   normal abd labs and lactate), med effect (on methadone and prn narcs).
   - continue art line
   - continue phenylephrine and norepinephrine drips titrate to MAP>65.
   - Plan to wean off  norepinephrine as soon as possible because of
   questionable poor bowel perfusion.
   - goal SBP>90, MAP> 65; D5-HCO3 bolus prn
   - has 2 PIVs, femoral line, HD line (for emergency).

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. The patient was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe (RLL) consolidation, hypotension, and confusion.

The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities, which need to be addressed. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient has a high WBC count and consolidation seen on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible pneumonia. The bronchial washing Gram stain showed polymorphonuclear leukocytes, budding yeast, and a few gram-positive rods. These findings indicate the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and fungal infection such as Candida. Antibiotics and antifungal medication have been prescribed.

2. Hyponatremia and Hypochloremia: The patient's sodium and chloride levels are low. These electrolyte imbalances can lead to various symptoms including confusion, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Abdominal pain and possible pseudo-obstruction: The patient's abdominal pain could be due to pseudo-obstruction, toxic megacolon, ischemic bowel, or sepsis. The moderate colonic distention with air-fluid levels seen"

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, altered mental status, and suspected right lower lobe consolidation. The patient's medical history includes COPD, and she underwent stenting of the right mainstem bronchus. She has been treated with chemotherapy and radiation for SCLC. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, amiodarone, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a high white blood cell count and fever, indicating a possible infection. She is on multiple antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and line-related infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and she is on vasopressor support with phenylephrine and norepinephrine to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. The cause of hypotension could be septic shock or intra-abdominal process.
3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has abdominal pain"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe consolidation, hypotension, and fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 110 bpm, blood pressure of 105/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on volume control ventilation. She has multiple lines including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and dialysis catheter. The patient is on several medications including antibiotics, pain management, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, fever, and consolidation seen on chest X-ray, indicating a possible infection. Antibiotics have been started for coverage.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive despite the administration of vasopressors. This could be due to sepsis or another underlying cause.
3. Hyponatremia and Hypochloremia: Repeat labs are needed to confirm these electrolyte imbalances.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain could be caused by pseudoobstruction, sepsis, toxic megacolon, or"

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and gout. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe consolidation, hypotension, and fever. She has a white blood cell count of 75.3 and consolidation seen on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive, and the differential diagnosis includes infection, intra-abdominal process, and medication effect. The plan includes continuing arterial line, phenylephrine, and norepinephrine drips, titrating to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, and goal systolic blood pressure (SBP) >90. D5-HCO3 bolus will be given as needed. She has two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, a femoral line, and a hemodialysis (HD) line for emergency use.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease. She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe consolidation, and hypotension. She has multiple comorbidities and is currently on multiple medications.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, requiring the use of norepinephrine and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. This could be due to sepsis, intra-abdominal process, or medication effects.
2. Hyponatremia and Hypochloremia: The patient has low levels of sodium and chloride in her blood. This could be due to various factors, including fluid resuscitation or kidney dysfunction.
3. Infection: The patient has a high white blood cell count and consolidation seen on chest X-ray, indicating a possible infection. She is already receiving vancomycin for line coverage and piperacillin/tazobactam for gram-negative bacterial coverage.
4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal distension and firmness suggest pseudo-obstruction, sepsis, toxic megacolon, or ischemic bowel. She is on contact precautions and receiving treatment for Clostridium difficile infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and end-stage renal disease.
- She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, unresponsive status, fever, and respiratory distress.
- The patient has been on mechanical ventilation since admission.
- She has been receiving multiple vasopressor medications to maintain adequate blood pressure.
- Laboratory results show hyponatremia, hypochloremia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated lactate levels.
- Imaging studies indicate the presence of pneumonia and possible colonic ileus.
- The patient has a history of COPD, ESRD, and SCLC.
- She has undergone various interventions, including stent placement in the right mainstem bronchus, thoracentesis, and bronchoscopy.
- The patient's condition remains unstable, and her prognosis is poor. The family has been consulted, and goals of treatment have been discussed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and respiratory distress suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Multiorgan Dysfunction Syndrome: Given the patient's hypotension, elevated lactate levels, and renal dysfunction, there is a risk of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome.

   previously on coumadin, COPD, and ESRD on [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU with
   abdominal pain, likely RLL consolidation, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: persists; ddx includes infection (high risk given fever
   and WBC), intraabdominal process (given abd pain although relatively
   normal abd labs and lactate), med effect (on methadone and prn narcs).
   - continue art line
   - continue phenylephrine and norepinephrine drips titrate to MAP>65.
   - Plan to wean off norepinephrine as soon as possible because of
   questionable poor bowel perfusion.
   - goal SBP>90, MAP> 65; D5-HCO3 bolus prn
   - has 2 PIVs, femoral line, HD line (for emergency).
   - rx infection as below
   # Hyponatremia and Hypochloremia: persists on repeat labs
   # ID: high WBC ([**2141-7-18**]: 65.9) and consolidation seen on CXR.
   - continue vanco for line coverage and for HAP coverage; goal > 20;
   consider ordering vanc level to determine dosing if pt
s son wishes to
   continue current level of care
   - continue pip/tazo for GNR HAP coverage
   - f/u blood and sputum cx
   - send cdiff x3 and begin treatment and contact precautions
   # Abd pain: distension and firmness improved. ddx includes
   pseudoobstruction vs sepsis vs toxic megacolon vs ischemic bowel.
   Suspect pseudoobstruction ([**Last Name (un) 1951**]) given distended colonic bowel.
   [**Month (only) 60**] be worsened by constipation and medications.

   - keep NPO for now; attempt to minimize narcotics
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - General Surgery consult: not a surgical candidate at this time
   - GI consult:  Limited role of acute intervention at this time;
   recommend comfort care measures
   # SCLC/COPD/SOB: s/p stent placed in right mainstem bronchus and right
   sided thoracentesis for worsening pleural effusion.
   - Pt intubated [**2141-7-17**] Volume control ventilation
   - Bronchoscopy:  confirmed patency of stent and distal airway, thin

   # Pain control: Will continue methadone but try to minimize meds given
   pseudoobstruction
   # Insulin dependent DM: 70/30 and ISS.  Consider increasing basal dose
   due to manage elevated bs.
   # Atrial fibrillation: Now in NSR but was in afib earlier this stay.
   Off coumadin.
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg po BID ( beta blockers and dilt are not

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 70-year-old female with a medical history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe consolidation, and hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes fever, hypotension, unresponsiveness, and the need for both norepinephrine and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Electrolyte abnormality persists with sodium of 128 mEq/L and chloride of 88 mEq/L. Arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.45, PaCO2 30 mmHg, HCO3- 87 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96%.

The patient's medications include fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), norepinephrine, heparin sodium, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, and codeine. The patient also has allergies to cisplatin and metronidazole.

The patient's recent laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with neutrophils at 94.0%, bands at 0.9%, lymphocytes at 0.0%, monocytes at 1.7%, eosinoph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). She was admitted to the ICU with abdominal pain, likely right lower lobe consolidation, and hypotension. The patient is currently unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. She has several medical complications including hyponatremia, hypochloremia, possible infection, acute kidney injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's high fever, elevated white blood cell count, and coarse breath sounds bilaterally suggest a possible infection. Given her hypotension and altered mental status, there is a concern for sepsis.
2. Hypotension: Despite being on multiple vasopressors, the patient's blood pressure remains low. This could indicate inadequate perfusion and may lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest AKI. This could be due to hypotension, dehydration, or medications.
4. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's low oxygen saturation and the need for mechanical ventilation suggest the possibility of ARDS. This could be secondary to the lung infection or other factors.

","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, and end-stage renal disease. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, unresponsiveness, and symptoms suggestive of an infection, including fever and elevated white blood cell count. She is currently intubated on volume control ventilation and receiving multiple infusions of medications to maintain hemodynamic stability. She also has a history of COPD, and recent interventions have included stent placement in the right mainstem bronchus and thoracentesis for pleural effusion. She is being treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and Clostridium difficile infection. Other concerns include potential bowel obstruction, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for pain management. The patient's current condition is unstable, and she is on life support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, elevated white blood cell count, and hypotension suggests a systemic infection, which can progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Multiorgan dysfunction: Given the patient's multiple comorbidities and the severity of her illness, there is a risk of multiorgan dysfunction, particularly in the context of sepsis and potential bowel obstruction.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and she is currently intubated on volume control ventilation"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 70yo F with SCLC, DMII, HTN, hyperlipidemia, A fib with RVR
   previously on coumadin, COPD, and ESRD on [**Hospital **] transferred to MICU with
   abdominal pain, likely RLL consolidation, and hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: persists; ddx includes infection (high risk given fever
   and WBC), intraabdominal process (given abd pain although relatively
   normal abd labs and lactate), med effect (on methadone and prn narcs).
   - continue art line
   - continue phenylephrine and norepinephrine drips titrate to MAP>65.
   - Plan to wean off norepinephrine as soon as possible because of
   questionable poor bowel perfusion.
   - goal SBP>90, MAP> 65; D5-HCO3 bolus prn
   - has 2 PIVs, femoral line, HD line (for emergency).
   - rx infection as below
   .# Hyponatremia and Hypochloremia: persists on repeat labs
   # ID: high WBC ([**2141-7-18**]: 65.9) and consolidation seen on CXR.
   - continue vanco for line coverage and for HAP coverage; goal > 20;
   most recent level: 18.3. (decrease of 0.7 in 24 hours)
   - continue pip/tazo for GNR HAP coverage
   - cx sputum, blood and f/u
   - send cdiff x3 and begin treatment and contact precautions
   .
   # Abd pain: ddx includes pseudoobstruction vs sepsis vs toxic megacolon
   vs ischemic bowel.  Suspect pseudoobstruction ([**Last Name (un) 1951**]) given
   distended colonic bowel.  [**Month (only) 60**] be worsened by constipation and
   medications.
   - send C. diff x3 ;initiate rx for C. difficile ( IV flagyl, po vanc)
   - serial abd exams
   - serial KUBs
   - manual disimpact prn
   - continue rectal tube and OG
   - keep NPO for now; attempt to minimize narcotics
   - aggressive lytes repletion
   - General Surgery consult: not a surgical candidate at this time
   - GI consult:  Limited role of acute intervention at this time;
   recommend comfort care measures
   .
   # SCLC/COPD/SOB: s/p stent placed in right mainstem bronchus and right
   sided thoracentesis for worsening pleural effusion.
   - Pt intubated [**2141-7-17**] Volume control ventilation
   - Bronchoscopy:  confirmed patency of stent and distal airway, thin
   cloudy secretions.
   - bronchial washings: Gram stain (PMN, budding yeast, G+ cocci) and cx
   pending
   - will continue abx as above
   - f/u pleural fluid cx
   - continue nebs
   # ESRD: Hold off on hemodialysis due to hemodynamic instability.
   Continue to renally dose meds.
   .
   # SVC syndrome: Venogram showed some small thrombi but no DVT, stridor
   or extrinsic SVC compression. d/w renal in am.
   # Small cell lung cancer T2N2MO(Stage IIIA), diagnosed [**2138**],
   s/p surgery, chemo w/ cisplatin & etoposide, & radiation. Most recent
   treatment with VP etoposide cycle 14 [**2141-6-23**] and Neulasta [**2141-6-24**]
   .
   # Pain control: Will continue methadone but try to minimize meds given
   pseudoobstruction
   .
   # Insulin dependent DM: 70/30 and ISS
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Now in NSR but was in afib earlier this stay.
   Off coumadin for procedures.  Consider restarting if no procedures
   planned.
   - Switch from amiodarone  drip 0.5mg/min to 400mg po BID ( beta
   blockers and dilt are not options at this time due to hypotension)
   # Gout: stable, cont allopurinol
   .
   # PPX: protonix, bowel regimen, subq heparin
   .
   # Access: piv x2, femoral line
   .
   # contact: son [**Name (NI) 1942**] is HCP [**Telephone/Fax (1) 3427**].  ICU consent in chart
       - Schedule meeting with family to discuss goals of treatment

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 70-year-old female with a history of small cell lung cancer, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage renal disease, and gout. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, unresponsive status, fever, and likely right lower lobe consolidation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, requiring both norepinephrine and phenylephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65. Electrolyte abnormalities persist, including hyponatremia and hypochloremia. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating possible infection. Cultures are pending. The patient's abdominal pain may be due to pseudo-obstruction, sepsis, toxic megacolon, or ischemic bowel. She has been placed on contact precautions and treatment for Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's small cell lung cancer is at stage IIIA, and she has undergone surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment. She is also insulin-dependent for diabetes mellitus. Her atrial fibrillation is currently in normal sinus rhythm but was in atrial fibrillation earlier during the stay. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including gout, and is on various medications. She has multiple lines and catheters in place. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), and her disposition is ICU care."
