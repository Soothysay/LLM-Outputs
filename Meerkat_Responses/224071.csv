   Chief Complaint: GI bleed
   24 Hour Events:
   Tachycardia improved to 110s with pRBCs and IVF, but HCT continued to
   drop despite ongoing transfusions. He also continued to have large
   amounts of maroon liquid stool. NGT placement was planned but refused
   by the patient. No additional peripheral access was able to be
   obtained.
   Given his evidence of ongoing bleeding, GI was consulted and advised a
   PPI gtt, IV fluid, blood products, and intubation prior to any
   endoscopy. Pt was intubated at 1:30AM, and then central access was
   attempted at both IJ's prior to being achieved at the right femoral
   vein. OG lavage returned copious amounts of RB and clot. Surgery was
   consulted in case of progressive hemorrhage.
   The patient received a total of 4 units pRBCs overnight, without
   appropriate bump, as well as 2 units of FFP. GI is to perform endoscopy
   this AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with muscular dystrophy who presented with bilateral femur fractures and was admitted to the MICU for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). He was found to have multiple stress ulcers with stigmata of recent bleeding. The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight. He was intubated due to his high risk for endoscopy. An endoscopy was performed and revealed 3 large antral stress ulcers, one with stigmata of recent bleeding. Epinephrine was injected around the large ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcers: The patient has already experienced acute UGIB and requires ongoing monitoring for any signs of recurrent bleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: Although the patient was intubated as a precautionary measure, he does not have a true gas exchange problem. After the endoscopy, the plan is to wean sedation and extubate the patient. If extubation is not possible, replacing the OG tube may be necessary.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely a stress reaction. Monitoring and pancytopenia testing are recommended.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels due to"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy who presented with bilateral femur fractures, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's current condition includes ongoing UGIB, respiratory failure requiring intubation, diarrhea, chronic pain control, Becker muscular dystrophy, bilateral hip fracture with fixation, and psychiatric disorders. The patient has received multiple blood products and fluids overnight and has been transfused to a goal hematocrit (HCT) of 30. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Continued bleeding: The patient has ongoing UGIB despite receiving blood products and fluids. There is a risk of further bleeding and potential need for surgical intervention.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma due to positive pressure ventilation.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of HAP and is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of developing additional infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital-acquired infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male admitted to the ICU for a fall with bilateral femur fractures. The hospital course has been complicated by a postoperative pneumonia and now upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 120/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated for airway protection. The patient has been receiving IV pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis and has had multiple blood transfusions due to active bleeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Further bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, and he has received multiple blood transfusions, indicating ongoing bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs, hematocrit levels, and blood product transfusions is crucial to prevent further bleeding and maintain adequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of postoperative pneumonia and is currently receiving empiric antibiotic coverage. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or worsening respiratory status, is important.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Monitoring of respiratory parameters, including oxygen saturation, peak inspiratory pressures, and end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, is essential to assess the adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 30-year-old male with Becker's muscular dystrophy who was admitted with bilateral femur fractures, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), and acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has had multiple stress ulcers with stigmata of recent bleeding. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to an upper gastrointestinal source, specifically stress ulcers. The patient has been receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and has been advanced to clear liquids.
2. Leukocytosis that is resolving, likely a stress reaction. Panculture results are negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff).
3. Hypernatremia due to excessive repletion with intravenous normal saline (NS). Sodium levels should be monitored and adjusted accordingly.
4. Chronic pain control is needed due to underlying muscular dystrophy and recent surgery. The patient is currently on dilaudid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and will be transitioned to oral pain medications once tolerated.
5. Muscular dystrophy management includes continuing Baclofen for muscle spasms.
6. Bilateral hip fracture fixation occurred on [date]. Orthopedic recommendations should be followed, including using compression stockings (pboots) instead of low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
7. The patient has a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of muscular dystrophy who was admitted to the ICU for acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) due to multiple stress ulcers. The patient also has a history of bilateral femur fractures, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), chronic pain control, Becker's muscular dystrophy, bilateral hip fracture fixation, and a seizure disorder. The patient was extubated this morning but remained very sleepy. His hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 28.2 to 25.7, and he had another episode of maroon-colored stool. The patient received a unit of red blood cells (RBC) transfusion. He is on dilaudid PCA and was not taking oral medications overnight due to refusal. The patient is angry, wants to leave, and is refusing examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of UGIB due to stress ulcers, and there have been ongoing issues with maroon-colored stool, indicating potential ongoing bleeding.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with leukocytosis, which has since resolved, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any potential recurrence.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia due to excessive repletion with IV normal saline (NS). It is essential to monitor and manage his sodium levels appropriately.
4. Chronic Pain Control: The patient requires chronic narcotics"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 30-year-old male admitted for a fall with bilateral femur fractures. The hospital course has been complicated by perioperative pneumonia and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient was intubated for airway protection and successfully extubated without complication. He has leukocytosis likely due to stress from the UGIB, which was initially treated empirically with metronidazole but discontinued due to low suspicion and negative toxin. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is being closely monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB): The patient has a history of UGIB, and it is essential to continue monitoring his condition for any signs of re-bleeding or further complications.
2. Respiratory issues: Although the patient was successfully extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory problems due to the previous intubation and potential damage to the airways.
3. Infection: The patient has had perioperative pneumonia and should continue to be monitored for any signs of infection or worsening respiratory status.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may indicate a stress reaction or potential infection. Close monitoring and follow-up cultures are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Fluid and electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hypernatremic/hyperchloremic fluid balance, which needs to be corrected and managed carefully to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 30-year-old male with a history of fall and bilateral femur fracture, complicated by perioperative pneumonia and now upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient has been extubated successfully and is currently on IV PPI (proton pump inhibitor), holding NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and anticoagulants. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is being monitored and transfused to keep above 27 due to recent active bleeding. He also has leukocytosis, likely a stress reaction to the gastrointestinal bleeding, and has been started on Flagyl empirically but discontinued due to low suspicion and negative toxin. Cultures will be followed up. The patient's fluid balance shows a net loss of 1,755 mL since midnight. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/68 to 136/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure (CVP) is 23 mmHg, and blood products have been transfused with a total input of 1,304 mL and output of 1,755 mL. The patient's urine output is 1,455 mL, and he has received 2,278 mL of IV fluids with 811 mL given since midnight. The"
