","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of multi-lumen central venous catheter insertion in the right internal jugular vein. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received a dose of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) at 05:13 AM on 03/01/2124.

Infusions include norepinephrine at a rate of 0.08 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications are not specified in the note. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 77 bpm with a normal sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 96/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 1 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 6,454 mL and an output of 4,025 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,429 mL. The patient has received 1,454 mL of intravenous fluids.

The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note.

   65 yom with hx of HTN, Hyperthyroidism who presents with complaint of
   nausea and vomiting x 3 days, also with abdominal pain who became
   hypotensive and febrile in the ED admitted to the ICU for hypotension.
   # Sepsis:  Mr. [**Known lastname 4308**] presented with leukocytosis, fevers, abdominal
   pain, nausea, vomiting and hypotension which together are all
   concerning for sepsis.  He was initially on levophed for hypotension
   which has now been weaned off.  No source of infection at this time.
   Plan is to continue with Vanco/Zosyn for broad coverage until cultures
   remain negative for 48-72 hours.
   -- cont Vanco/Zosyn
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- f/u urine culture
   -- IVF boluses PRN
   # Adrenal Insufficiency:  patient had initial cortisol level of 5 in
   the setting of infection which increased to only 11 with stimulation
   which raised the concern for adrenal insufficiency.  He was given
   stress dose steroids yesterday and was weaned off of levophed with good
   response.  He was given his last dose at 8am this morning.  We will
   stop steroids at this time and monitor his BP.  If BP remains stable
   then he will be called out to the medical floor.
   -- stop steroids
   -- monitor for hypotension
   # Anemia:  Patient with acute HCT drop in setting of IVF
   resuscitation.  Likely dilutional in the setting IVF resuscitation.
   Anemia also microcytic which raises the concern for occult bleeding.
   HCT stable since yesterday.
   - follow HCT daily
   - send Ferritin/Iron/TIBC, folate, B12
   - if Iron deficiency will need outpatient colonoscopy
   # ST depressions: Initial ECG with < 1mm ST segment depressions on ECG
   which subsequently resolved.  He has ROMI.
   -- likely needs stress as outpatient
   # Hypothyroidism: restarted synthroid
   # FEN: ADAT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hyperthyroidism. He was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and presented with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, fevers, and hypotension, which are concerning for sepsis. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and his condition has improved. He was also given stress dose steroids due to concerns about adrenal insufficiency, but his most recent cortisol level was within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/50-113/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 8 mmHg, and he is no longer on levophed for hypotension.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 187 K/uL and slightly elevated blood glucose level of 129 mg/dL. Other lab values such as hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include continued administration of Vanco/Zosyn, follow-up of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. He was admitted to the ICU due to acute heart failure exacerbation and septic shock. The patient received an additional 4 liters of normal saline, resulting in a total of 10 liters since admission. His central venous pressure (CVP) increased to 8, and the infusion of levophed was discontinued at 3 pm. The viral screen came back negative, ruling out viral infection as the cause of the shock. An echocardiogram (TTE) showed normal limits with good systolic function. The patient was started on stress dose steroids for 24-36 hours. Medications include synthroid 75mcg PO daily and vancomycin/zosyn. Allergies are non-existent. The last doses of antibiotics were administered at 8 pm and 10 pm. Infusions include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include prophylactic antibiotics, anticoagulants, and stress dose steroids. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 8 mm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He presented with nausea, vomiting, fever, hypotension, shock, and leukocytosis, which have all resolved. The initial diagnosis included gastroenteritis with aspiration pneumonitis and sepsis. However, the patient's condition improved, and the sepsis has been resolved with negative cultures so far.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 110/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, but no other abnormalities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal electrolyte levels. Cardiac enzymes are within normal range, as well as troponin-T levels. Blood cultures are negative.

The patient's current assessment includes hypotension that is not in shock, resolved sepsis, and microcytic anemia. The plan includes stopping stress dose steroids and monitoring vitals, continuing antibiotics for another 72 hours, ruling out cardiac causes for anemia, checking a peripheral blood smear, and adding an iron profile to admission labs. The patient's code status remains as full code, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism. He presented with nausea, vomiting, fever, hypotension, shock, and leukocytosis, which have since resolved. The patient was diagnosed with gastroenteritis with aspiration pneumonitis and sepsis, but these conditions have also resolved. The patient's troponin T levels were below the detection limit, indicating no cardiac involvement.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics, which will be stopped after 72 hours. Stress dose steroids are being monitored due to the patient's hypotension. Anemia is present and is microcytic, with a planned peripheral smear and iron profile. The patient's thyroid condition will be replaced, and a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) has been started for gastrointestinal concerns.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.5 C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/62 mmHg to 73/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is at 10 mmHg, indicating adequate fluid resuscitation.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient's history of hypertension and hypothyroidism may contribute to his overall health"
