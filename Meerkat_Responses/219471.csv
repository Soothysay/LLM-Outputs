   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q6h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider early renal consult for ?need for HD to get through acute
   period if developing anuric ATN.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass and involvement of the right kidney and inferior vena cava (IVC) compression. The patient presented with hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from acute retroperitoneal bleed. An angiogram was performed, revealing a pseudoaneurysm within the mass, which was likely the source of bleeding. The hemorrhage has been controlled through coiling by interventional radiology (IR), and there is no evidence of residual bleed. The patient's labs are improving, showing improvement in metabolic acidosis and lactate levels, as well as improved blood pressure and pressor requirements.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: The patient experienced hemorrhagic shock due to acute blood loss from the retroperitoneal bleed. Close monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and laboratory parameters (such as hemoglobin and hematocrit) will be essential to detect any signs of recurrent bleeding or ongoing blood loss.

2. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of acute bleed and shock. This could be due to aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolism (PE) given venous stasis of lower extremities from IVC compression. The patient is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on minimal settings.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Now oxygenating and ventilating very well on minimal
   settings.
   - CXR upon arrival to MICU.
   - Keep on AC at current settings for now (no plans for immediate
   extubation).
   - Propofol for sedation
   - Monitor today
 may be possible to extubate if patient remains stable
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antiotics given overall instability, but
   BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: Right IJ, peripheral x2, R axillary Aline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney and IVC compression. She presented with hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from acute right pelvic (RP) bleed. The patient underwent mesenteric angiogram for probable pseudoaneurysm seen on CT, which was subsequently coiled. Her labs are improving, with improvement in metabolic acidosis and lactate levels, as well as improved blood pressure and pressor requirements. However, she continues to have poor urine output, which is still worrisome despite some improvement over the past several hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, hemorrhagic: The patient initially experienced hemorrhagic shock due to acute blood loss from the RP bleed. Although the hemorrhage has been controlled through coiling, there is still a risk of ongoing blood loss or rebleeding.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of acute bleed and shock. The differential includes aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, or PE given venous stasis of lower extremities from IVC compression.
3. Retroperitoneal mass: The presence of a retroperitoneal mass raises concerns for various differentials, including RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman disease. Further evaluation and tissue diagnosis are needed to determine"

The patient is a 67-inch, 72.9 kg male admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is oliguria with urine output ranging from 15-50ml/hour, most recently 50/hour. Bladder pressures were monitored every 4 hours, with the last reading being 17mmHg. The patient's hematocrit had been stable but drifted down to 24.7 and is being transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient has allergies to penicillins, sulfa, and tetracycline. Infusions include fentanyl at 175 mcg/hour and propofol at 80 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (Protonix) given at [**2189-4-21**] 12:00 AM, fentanyl given at [**2189-4-21**] 05:09 AM, and propofol given at [**2189-4-21**] 06:44 AM.

 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also [**Last Name (LF) 12449**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - Repeat hct 29.6 at 9am (Hct 24.7 at 2am)

   - Note thyroid nodules on problem list as above; updated D/C ppwk
   - TSH added on returned 1.9
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a pleasant female in the ICU with ongoing concerns regarding nutrition, pain control, and a retroperitoneal bleed. She has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she is hypertensive and tachycardic in the setting of pain. The patient's right dorsal pedal pulse is diminished, and both feet are cool to the touch. Imaging studies reveal extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas, suggesting a large pseudoaneurysm. The cause of this pseudoaneurysm is unclear and may be related to prior trauma, pancreatitis, or duodenal ulceration/inflammation. There is also marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels due to compression by the large hematoma. The patient has acute renal compromise and incidentally noted thyroid nodules. Her hemoglobin level has improved from 24.7 to 29.6 over the past day. The patient continues to experience pain and has been given multiple pain medications, including morphine and dilaudid. She is also experiencing nausea and agitation, for which she has been given ondansetron and metoclopramide. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 04/20/21. She has a history of allergies to penicillins, sulfa, tetracycline, and unknown allergies. She is currently receiving f"

   24 Hour Events:
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - STOP [**2189-4-21**] 10:52 AM
   - GI recs: Obtain EGD when clinically stable (for ?lymphoma involvement
   of stomach); Abdominal u/s to rule out necrotizing pancreatitis
   (already ordered, not yet completed)
   - Pt continues in pain on morphine, also nauseous, will try dilaudid
   - Final CT ab/pelvis/chest read [**4-20**]: 1. Extensive retroperitoneal
   hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation posterior to the pancreas
   suggestive of a large pseudoaneurysm. Etiology of this pseudoaneurysm
   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

   1. Extensive retroperitoneal hemorrhage with IV contrast extravasation

   duodenal ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is

   for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent basis.
   Abdominal U/S ([**4-22**]): completed but not read
   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access - CVL right now; if further active
   bleeding needs cordis or improved PIV access.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - F/U final read of CT abdomen/pelvis
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD to rule out acute or
   chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed recs.

   is unclear and may relate to prior trauma, pancreatitis or duodenal
   ulceration/inflammation. No definite retroperitoneal mass is
   identified. These findings were discussed urgently between radiology
   resident Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 364**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and surgical resident Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 6302**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 6361**], and
   the patient was referred to interventional radiology for intervention.
   2. Marked narrowing of the mesenteric vessels, presumably due to
   compression by the large hematoma, however these vessels should also be
   evaluated during angiography. 3. CT findings of acute renal compromise.
   4. Incidentally noted thyroid nodules, the largest measuring up to 2.2
   cm, for which thyroid ultrasound is recommended on a non-emergent
   basis.
   - PCP [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 12450**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**Telephone/Fax (1) 12451**] called by [**Doctor First Name 2226**] to update.
   - Morphine changed to dilaudid as pt c/o nausea/agitation with
   morphine; home meds of Ultram and gabapentin were restarted to help
   with pain. Pain still not well controlled, so dilaudid increased to [**1-17**]
   mg Q3H (likely some narcotic tolerance given home vicodin use).
   - Patient became hypertensive/tachycardic in setting of pain;
   metoprolol was started in place of home atenolol at 12.5 TID (later
   increased to 25 TID with persistently elevated pressures).
   - Notified by nurse that patient's right DP pulse is diminished from
   prior. On exam, both feet are cool to the touch but right DP is very
   faint (but dopplerable). Groin site on right from angiogram with no
   concerning findings: dressing C/D/I, no palpable hematoma, no bruit.

   Assessment and Plan
   53F with newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass with involvement of
   right kidney and IVC compression, now with hypotension and hemorrhagic
   shock from acute RP bleed.
   .
   # SHOCK, HEMORRHAGIC: Presumed hemorrhagic from acute blood loss at RP
   mass (presumed that this is mass with bleed, also could be hematoma as
   below).  Had pseudoaneursym within this mass which likely represents
   bleeding source.  Now s/p coiling by IR in attempt to stop hemorrhage
   with no evidence of residual bleed.  Labs improving - improvement in
   metabolic acidosis, lactate; pressor requirements/BPs also improved.
   Having some poor UOP which is still worrisome though this has been
   improving over the past several hours. Hemodynamically stable.
   - IR following.
   - General surgery following - will update following IR procedure.
   - Maintain excellent IV access
 good PIV access now; will plan to pull
   old CVL from OSH.
   - Maintain normothermia.
   - Keep crossed at least 4 units PRBCs and active blood bank specimen.
   - Monitor CVP off CVL; goal CVP 8-12.
   - Trend Hct Q8-12h
   - Transfuse Hct < 30 or evidence of shock or active bleeding.
   - Keep INR < 1.5; Plts > 50; f'gen > 100.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need IV calcium with blood as well; watch icals.
   - Will utilize LR for further IVF resuscitation based on low bicarb (no
   lactic acidosis or AG).
   - No longer necessary to trend bladder pressures
   - Change to PO Dilaudid for pain control
   - F/U CT in [**3-21**] weeks
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE.  Developed hypoxic respiratory failure in
   setting of acute bleed and shock.  Differential includes aspiration
   from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, PE given
   venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression (though would be unable to
   anticoagulate and likely unable to place filter given IVC
   compression).  Extubated on [**2189-4-21**] and now oxygenating and ventilating
   well on room air.
   -- Monitor respiratory status s/p extubation
   .
   # RETROPERITONEAL MASS:  The differential for an enhancing
   retroperitoneal mass includes RP hematoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, large
   metastasis, infection (abscess, tuberculosis), schwannoma, or Castleman
   disease.  OSH read of initial imaging concerning for mass, but per
   initial [**Hospital1 5**] read, cannot definitively say there is mass vs. this
   being all RP hematoma.  Arguing against bland hematoma as explanation
   is relatively normal Hct at initial presentation - would expect this to
   be lower unless having slow bleed and time to generate sufficient
   marrow response to compensate, which is also possible. Lipase remains
   flat.
   - General surgery following.
   - Defer tissue diagnosis of mass until more medically stable.
   - Appreciate GI recs
 will likely need EGD eventually to rule out
   acute or chronic duodenal ulcer.
   - d/w GI utility of RUQ ultrasound
   - Further history from family re: ?chronic or acute pancreatitis.
   - Now that s/p coiling, worry most about blood supply to duodenum and
   potential for bowel necrosis.  Will monitor abdominal exam, lactates,
   films for free air, and surgical followup.
   - F/U abdominal US done this morning
   .
   # LOW URINE OUTPUT: Likely represents new ARF - prerenal vs. ATN
   (ischemic/shock, multiple contrast admin) vs. mass compression of
   kidney/vessels/ureter (not seen on current imaging).  Contrast in
   kidneys seen from scan several hours ago - will likely have further
   contrast injury from second CT and angio.  Most recently UOP has been
   50 cc/hr (x 3 hrs).
   - Monitor CVPs, goal CVP 8-12.  Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.
   - Continue to monitor lytes, respiratory status.
   - Consider bicarb/mucomyst.
   - Renal function and UOP improving this morning; continue to trend and
   follow closely
   .
   # METABOLIC ACIDOSIS: Combination of lactic acidosis from shock, some
   may also be renal failure related.
   - Management of shock, oliguria as above.
   .
   # HYPOTHERMIA.  T95 on arrival to TSICU.   Was initially on Bair hugger
   though this has no been discontinued as patient is normothermic.
   - Send blood and urine cultures.
   - No evidence of pneumonia on CXR.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics, but will hold off for now.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Reactive from acute stressors above.  Resolved.
   - Low threshold to cover with antibiotics given overall instability,
   but BPs currently improved and no evidence of source.
   .
   # FEN: NPO - ADAT, bolus prn with LR, replete lytes as above, tube feed
   recs.
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PO PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old female who was admitted with a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney and IVC compression. She presented with hypotension and hemorrhagic shock from acute RP bleed. The patient underwent coiling by interventional radiology (IR) to stop hemorrhage, which showed no evidence of residual bleed. Labs are improving, including metabolic acidosis and lactate levels, and pressor requirements/BPs have also improved. However, the patient still has poor urine output (oliguria) and requires close monitoring. The patient was extubated and is oxygenating and ventilating well on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock, hemorrhagic: The patient initially presented with hemorrhagic shock due to acute retroperitoneal bleed. Although the bleeding has been controlled with coiling, it is important to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and continue to trend vital signs.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient developed hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of acute bleed and shock. The differential includes aspiration from altered mental status, hypoventilation from above, ARDS, and PE given venous stasis of LEs from IVC compression. The patient was extubated and is currently oxygenating and ventilating well on room air.
3. Retroperitoneal mass: The patient has a newly diagnosed right retroperitoneal mass involving the right kidney and IVC compression. The differential for an enhancing retro"
