   Assessment and Plan
   71 year old man with likely microscopic polyangiitis and now with
   transient fevers and hypoxia of unclear etiology, now transferred to
   the MICU service for ongoing care.
   .
   Plan:
   ## Fevers: unclear etiology; could be pneumonia, though must rule out
   vasculitis-related etiologies
   - cont empiric levofloxacin; f/u pending micro data from here and
   [**Hospital1 **]
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon to eval for alveolar hemorrhage; send BAL
   for micro
   - f/u beta-D-glucan, galactomannan, parvovirus, CMV serologies;
   - Legionella antigen and Lyme serologies negative
   - prn meperidine for rigors
   .
   ## Microscopic polyangiitis
   - rheumatology consult called this morning by CCU team; f/u recs
   - cont prednisone 60 mg daily for now pending rheum recs; TMP/SMX for
   PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1374**]; vitamin D/calcium for bone prophylaxis
   - f/u ANCA titer
   .
   ## Hypoxia; transient with fevers/rigors
   - bronchoscopy this afternoon
   - follow CXRs
   .
   ## Pancytopenia: leukopenia and anemia seemingly have resolved this
   morning, though wonder if this could be a lab artifact given marked
   change in Hgb/Hct; likely a sequela of azathioprine use
   - cont holding azathioprine for now
   - recheck CBC
   - f/u parasite smear for Babesia, SPEP/UPEP
   - consider heme consult if persistent
   - add on LDH, reticulocyte count, TBili, haptoglobin
   .
   ## CAD s/p CABG; minor troponin-T elevation likely from acute medical
   stressors and not representative of ACS/NSTEMI
   - cont aspirin; resume beta blocker once stable
   .
   ## Atrial fibrillation
   - cont warfarin
   - cont holding beta blockade for now given possibility of ongoing
   infection
   - follow INR given antibiotics most likely to change it
   .
   ## FEN: NPO pending bronchoscopy
   ## Prophylaxis: therapeutic on warfarin; on ppi
   ## Access: peripheral IVs

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 71-year-old man with a likely diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis, which is a small-vessel vasculitis. He presented with fevers, hypoxia, and pancytopenia (leukopenia and anemia). The patient's condition is unstable, and he has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) service for ongoing care.

The patient's current plan includes evaluating the cause of his fevers, which could be due to pneumonia or other vasculitis-related etiologies. Empiric levofloxacin is being continued, and a bronchoscopy will be performed to evaluate for alveolar hemorrhage. Microbiological samples will be sent for analysis.

Regarding microscopic polyangiitis, a rheumatology consult has been called, and the patient is continuing on prednisone 60 mg daily pending further recommendations. TMP/SMX is being given for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis, and vitamin D and calcium will be provided for bone prophylaxis. ANCA titer follow-up is also planned.

The patient's hypoxia appears to be transient and associated with fevers and rigors. A bronchoscopy will be performed, and follow-up chest X-rays are planned.

Pancytopenia, which includes leukopenia and anemia, seems to have resolved, but there may be a lab artifact given the marked change in Hgb"
