   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Hx of COPD, Asthma, and OSA: Hypoxia: Although
   patient responds to narcan, opiate overdose is unlikely given that pt
   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with
   CPAP.   Likely represents pt
s baseline respiratory status.
   - limit amount of medications -> d/c narcan
   - f/u blood and sputum culture
   - hold sedating meds, psych rec
d d/c Cogentin/Pimozide/Cymbalta
   - Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate decrease in
   flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response. Normal
   diffusion capacity. Features suggestive of poorly controlled asthma
   associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 4211**], [**Name (NI) 4348**]  (pt has difficulty cooperating with meds)
   - Albuterol PRN
   - pt intermittently refusing CPAP [**3-6**] increased anxiety
   - Will titrate BiPAP for Sleep eval
   .
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial, combination of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and CNS medications.  Will attempt to increase
   minute ventilation to reduce hypercarbia and limit CNS active meds.
   Likely at baseline mental status, will need to discuss with family to
   determine.
   - f/u psych recs, d/c
d Cogentin/Pimozide/Cymbalta
   - limit medications
   - will have Sleep eval
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Colitis: Followed by GI, unlikely infectious source
   and pt not complaining of abdominal pain.  No diarrhea.
   - d/c ABX today ([**3-28**])
   - continue bowel regimen as tolerated
   .
   # CVID : Patient has been on IVIG therapy in the past but stopped this
   treatment approximately 2 years ago. Recent infusion had to be held as
   pt spiked temperature. Fever could be also due to IVIG transfusion,
   however it persisted 12 hr after transfusion. Doubt her acute
   presentation to be due to acute reaction, but should be discussed with
   blood bank.
   - f/u cultures
   - will discuss with outpt team long-term goals/plans for treatment
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient is asymptomatic and current BP's are at her
   baseline (SBP 60-80).  Current BPs unreliable because taken with thigh
   cuff and unable to get a-line.  Pt
s mental status at baseline, can not
   follow UOP since relies on HD.
   - Continue Fludrocort & Midrodine as per home regimen
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # ESRD:  On dialysis, s/p cadaveric transplant. rejection at 13, TTS
   schedule, last HD on Sat.
   - Continue scheduled HD on Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   - Continue Sevelamer
   .
   # DVT: Radiographic imaging and physical exam suggestive of extensive
   collaterals. Likely due to partial occlusion of SVC due to multiple
   lines and DVT. Not on any anticoagulation.
   - Will avoid subclavian/IJ central lines
   .
   # Mental illness: hx of anxiety and depression, lives in a group home;
   patient is unable to provide any additional details.
   - Psych to c/s outpt psychiatrist regarding outpt meds: Cymbalta,
   Klonopin, Pimozide, Cogentin, Benztropine
   - Social Work consult, further discussion re: med compliance, warranted
   - will limit psychotropic meds
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - Continue home PPI
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:
   - Residue free renal diet, although would limit PO intake given
   mental/respiratory status
   .
   # Access: Midline that currently only has one active port, will need to
   determine long-term goals of care to determine what type of access will
   be needed.  Pt has h/o very difficult access complicated by venous
   clots.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, OSA, ESRD on dialysis, and a mental illness diagnosis. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and altered mental status. She has been hypercarbic at baseline due to her body habitus and obstructive/restrictive lung disease. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4 C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 86/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. She is receiving CPAP support and has been intubated unsuccessfully. The patient's laboratory values show elevated potassium levels, low bicarbonate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. She has a history of multiple medical conditions and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure is likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure, pulmonary infection, or chemical pneumonitis after emesis. Limiting sedating medications and providing CPAP support are necessary interventions.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is multifactorial, including hypercarbic respiratory failure and CNS medications. Reducing hypercarbia and limiting CNS active medications are recommended interventions.
3. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to colitis. Discontinuing antibiotics and continuing a bowel regimen are advised.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, OSA, ESRD on dialysis, DVT, and mental illness. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She has been receiving various medications and treatments for her conditions, including narcan, antibiotics, and immunoglobulin therapy. The patient's current vital signs show hypotension, hypercarbia, and low oxygen saturation. She is somnolent and agitated, with a dry mouth and no signs of conjunctival irritation or oropharyngeal thrush. Her physical examination reveals supple neck, regular heart rhythm, wheezes in the lower lungs, and engorged chest wall veins. The patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal laboratory values. She is currently on CPAP, but hypoventilates, and may require intubation if her hypercarbia worsens. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxia and hypercarbia indicate a potential respiratory failure, possibly due to her underlying COPD, asthma, or a pulmonary infection.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent and agitated, which could be caused by hypercarbic respiratory failure, CNS medications, or a combination of both.
3. Abdominal pain/colitis: The patient has abdominal pain, which is improving, and is being managed"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including colitis, respiratory failure, psychiatric disease, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), renal failure, asthma, abdominal pain, and hypotension. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, and has had multiple interventions such as central venous catheter placement and mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's chronic respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
2. Renal Complications: As the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there is a risk of worsening renal function, fluid overload, and electrolyte imbalances.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of hypotension and SVC syndrome puts him at risk for further cardiovascular instability, including hypotension and potentially cardiac arrest.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient's history of colitis and abdominal pain increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation.
5. Infection: Due to the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, there is an increased risk of developing various infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), bloodstream infections, and wound infections.

   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and a previous kidney transplant. She is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status (AMS) with delirium responsive to hemodialysis. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, altered mental status, abdominal pain/colitis, CVID, hypotension, ESRD, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and a mental illness history of anxiety and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of asthma, COPD, and obstructive/restrictive lung disease. She is hypoventilating even with CPAP and has baseline oxygen saturation levels between 80-90%. There is a possibility of hypercarbic respiratory failure, especially if the patient is not adequately ventilating.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's AMS could be multifactorial, resulting from hypercarbic respiratory failure and CNS medications. It is important to reduce hypercarbia and limit CNS active medications to improve mental status.
3. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: Although the patient does not complain of abdominal pain, the presence of tenderness on deep palpation suggests a possible underlying issue. Further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, and CVID. She presented with AMS and delirium, which improved after dialysis. She also has respiratory failure due to her underlying conditions, including asthma and OSA. There are concerns about seizures, altered mental status, abdominal pain/colitis, CVID, hypotension, ESRD, DVT, and mental illness. The patient is on multiple medications and has had issues with medication compliance. She is currently on BiPAP and CPAP for respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has a history of asthma, COPD, and OSA, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Hypoxia is a concern, and the patient requires respiratory support with BiPAP and CPAP.
2. Seizures: There is a question of seizures due to clinical symptoms, but no OSH supports this diagnosis. An EEG is being done, and if positive, neuro consultation will be sought.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is multifactorial, including psychogenic factors and delirium. It has improved with dialysis but needs further evaluation and management.
4. Abdominal pain/colitis: Although the patient does not complain of abdominal pain, previous CT scans show similar findings. GI consultation has been followed, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory failure: Hx of COPD, Asthma, and OSA: Hypoxia: Although
   patient responds to narcan, opiate overdose is unlikely given that pt
   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with
   CPAP.   Likely represents pt
s baseline respiratory status.
   - limit amount of medications -> d/c narcan
   - f/u blood and sputum culture
   - hold sedating meds, psych rec
d d/c Cogentin/Pimozide/Cymbalta
   - Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate decrease in
   flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response. Normal
   diffusion capacity. Features suggestive of poorly controlled asthma
   associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 4211**], [**Name (NI) 4348**]  (pt has difficulty cooperating with meds)
   - Albuterol PRN
   - pt intermittently refusing CPAP [**3-6**] increased anxiety
   - Will titrate BiPAP for Sleep eval
   .
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial, combination of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure and CNS medications.  Will attempt to increase
   minute ventilation to reduce hypercarbia and limit CNS active meds.
   Likely at baseline mental status, will need to discuss with family to
   determine.
   - f/u psych recs, d/c
d Cogentin/Pimozide/Cymbalta
   - limit medications
   - will have Sleep eval
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Colitis: Followed by GI, unlikely infectious source
   and pt not complaining of abdominal pain.  No diarrhea.
   - d/c ABX today ([**3-28**])
   - continue bowel regimen as tolerated
   .
   # CVID : Patient has been on IVIG therapy in the past but stopped this
   treatment approximately 2 years ago. Recent infusion had to be held as
   pt spiked temperature. Fever could be also due to IVIG transfusion,
   however it persisted 12 hr after transfusion. Doubt her acute
   presentation to be due to acute reaction, but should be discussed with
   blood bank.
   - f/u cultures
   - will discuss with outpt team long-term goals/plans for treatment
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient is asymptomatic and current BP's are at her
   baseline (SBP 60-80).  Current BPs unreliable because taken with thigh
   cuff and unable to get a-line.  Pt
s mental status at baseline, can not
   follow UOP since relies on HD.
   - Continue Fludrocort & Midrodine as per home regimen
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # ESRD:  On dialysis, s/p cadaveric transplant. rejection at 13, TTS
   schedule, last HD on Sat.
   - Continue scheduled HD on Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   - Continue Sevelamer
   .
   # DVT: Radiographic imaging and physical exam suggestive of extensive
   collaterals. Likely due to partial occlusion of SVC due to multiple
   lines and DVT. Not on any anticoagulation.
   - Will avoid subclavian/IJ central lines
   .
   # Mental illness: hx of anxiety and depression, lives in a group home;
   patient is unable to provide any additional details.
   - Psych to c/s outpt psychiatrist regarding outpt meds: Cymbalta,
   Klonopin, Pimozide, Cogentin, Benztropine
   - Social Work consult, further discussion re: med compliance, warranted
   - will limit psychotropic meds
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - Continue home PPI
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:
   - Residue free renal diet, although would limit PO intake given
   mental/respiratory status
   .
   # Access: Midline that currently only has one active port, will need to
   determine long-term goals of care to determine what type of access will
   be needed.  Pt has h/o very difficult access complicated by venous
   clots.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current condition is as follows:

1. The patient underwent several medical procedures, including obtaining medical records, getting dialysis, and performing a sleep study. The echo results showed that the left atrium is normal in size, but the right atrial pressure is indeterminate. The left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function are normal, with an ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 55%. However, there is a potential focal wall motion abnormality that cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal technical quality. The aortic valve is not well seen, but there is no evidence of aortic stenosis or regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal, and no mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined, and there is no pericardial effusion. The overall impression is that the quality of the echo is suboptimal, and the global left ventricular function is probably normal, but a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. The right ventricle is not well seen, and no pathologic valvular abnormality is observed. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined.

2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with a range of 65-102 bpm, blood pressure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions including colitis, respiratory failure, psychiatric disease, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), asthma, and abdominal pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, which can lead to further respiratory distress and the need for mechanical ventilation support.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which can worsen kidney function and lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased risk of infections.
3. Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVC): SVC is a condition characterized by obstruction of the superior vena cava, leading to swelling and congestion in the upper body. This can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
4. Psychiatric Disease: The patient's psychiatric disease, such as schizophrenia or personality disorders, may contribute to agitation and difficulty in managing the patient's behavior in the ICU setting.
5. Colitis: The patient's colitis may lead to gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or abdominal pain, increasing the risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): OSA can cause respiratory compromise during sleep, leading to decreased oxygenation and potential cardiovascular"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo F with asthma COPD with stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, CVID p/w AMS
   with delirium responsive to HD.
   # Respiratory failure: Hx of COPD, Asthma, and OSA: Hypoxia: Although
   patient responds to narcan, opiate overdose is unlikely given that pt
   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with
   CPAP.   Likely represents pt
s baseline respiratory status. Baseline
   sats 80-90s. Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate
   decrease in flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response.
   Normal diffusion capacity. Features suggestive of poorly controlled
   asthma associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
   - f/u blood culture (NGTD), DFA negative
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 4211**], [**Name (NI) 4348**]  (pt has difficulty cooperating with meds)
   - Albuterol PRN
   - pt intermittently refusing CPAP [**3-6**] increased anxiety
   - Will titrate BiPAP for Sleep eval
   .
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial, psych considering delirium
   because of poor orientation. Psych recs to stop Cogentin/Pimozide. Does
   not appear to be hypercarbic respiratory failure. Mental status appears
   to have improved from dialysis. Patient no longer requiring restraints
   as of [**3-28**] evening.  Could be consistent with absence seizures
   clinically. No OSH support this though.
           -     f/u EEG to r/o absence seizures
   -          renal does not want re-dialyze today
   -          Will do LP and will consider CT head.
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Colitis: Followed by GI, unlikely infectious source
   and pt not complaining of abdominal pain.  No diarrhea. CT scan from
   [**8-9**] shows similar findings.
   - d/c ABX ([**3-28**])
   - continue bowel regimen as tolerated
   .
   # CVID : Patient has been on IVIG therapy in the past but stopped this
   treatment approximately 2 years ago. Recent infusion had to be held as
   pt spiked temperature. Fever could be also due to IVIG transfusion,
   however it persisted 12 hr after transfusion. Doubt her acute
   presentation to be due to acute reaction, but should be discussed with
   blood bank. Supposedly, patient was getting IVIG treatment every other
   week with dialysis.
   - f/u cultures
   - will discuss with outpt team long-term goals/plans for treatment
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient is asymptomatic and current BP's are at her
   baseline (SBP 60-80).  Current BPs unreliable because taken with thigh
   cuff and unable to get a-line.  Pt
s mental status at baseline, can not
   follow UOP since relies on HD.
   - Continue Fludrocort & Midrodine as per home regimen
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # ESRD:  On dialysis, s/p cadaveric transplant. rejection at 13, TTS
   schedule, last HD on Sat.
   - renal to dialyze today ([**3-30**])
   - Continue scheduled HD on Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   - Continue Sevelamer
   .
   # DVT: Radiographic imaging and physical exam suggestive of extensive
   collaterals. Likely due to partial occlusion of SVC due to multiple
   lines and DVT. Not on any anticoagulation.
   - Will avoid subclavian/IJ central lines
   .
   # Mental illness: hx of anxiety and depression, lives in a group home;
   patient is unable to provide any additional details.
   - Psych to c/s outpt psychiatrist regarding outpt meds: Cymbalta,
   Klonopin, Pimozide, Cogentin, Benztropine
   - Social Work consult, further discussion re: med compliance, warranted
   - will limit psychotropic meds
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - Continue home PPI
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:
   - Residue free renal diet, although would limit PO intake given
   mental/respiratory status
   .
   # Access: Midline that currently only has one active port, will need to
   determine long-term goals of care to determine what type of access will
   be needed.  Pt has h/o very difficult access complicated by venous
   clots.
   - will readdress access issue [**3-30**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. She presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have delirium, which improved with hemodialysis. The patient also has a cough and is producing a lot of sputum, with an improvement in oxygen levels overnight. Her renal plan includes hemodialysis, but it is not believed that she is uremic. An EEG is pending, as well as a sleep study. The patient's allergies include oxacillin, codeine, and an unknown allergy. She has received antibiotics, including metronidazole and ciprofloxacin. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 66/25-100/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes in the lower lungs, diffuse coarse crackles, regular heart rhythm, and no evidence of conjunctival irritation or thrush. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and creatinine levels, with normal platelet count, electrolytes, and glucose levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, COPD, stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, and CVID presenting with altered mental status responsive to HD. She has been experiencing coughing up a lot of sputum, improved oxygen levels, and slightly improved MS. The patient's renal plan for HD on [**3-30**] does not think she is uremic. EEG and sleep study are pending. Psych recommends duloxetine for SSRI if eventually added back on.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD, asthma, and OSA, which puts her at risk for respiratory failure. She is currently experiencing hypoxia and hypoventilation even with CPAP. Further monitoring and management are required.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is multifactorial and may be due to delirium, psych issues, or hypercarbic respiratory failure. It has improved with dialysis, but further evaluation and management are needed, including ruling out absence seizures.

3. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: Although the patient's abdominal pain has been followed by GI and is unlikely infectious, no diarrhea is present. A CT scan from [**8-9**] shows similar findings. The abdominal pain is not the main concern at this time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including chronic respiratory failure, psychiatric disease, superior vena cava syndrome (SVC), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), asthma, and a history of hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the patient's medical history and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's chronic respiratory failure and asthma, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, acute exacerbations of asthma, or respiratory failure.

2. Renal Complications: As the patient has end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremia.

3. Cardiovascular Complications: The presence of superior vena cava syndrome (SVC) increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, including hypotension, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illness and possible use of immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.

5. Psychiatric Complications: The patient's psychiatric disease may manifest with increased agitation or delirium in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo F with asthma COPD with stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, CVID p/w AMS
   with delirium responsive to HD.
   # Respiratory failure: Hx of COPD, Asthma, and OSA: Hypoxia: Although
   patient responds to narcan, opiate overdose is unlikely given that pt
   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with
   CPAP.   Likely represents pt
s baseline respiratory status. Baseline
   sats 80-90s. Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate
   decrease in flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response.
   Normal diffusion capacity. Features suggestive of poorly controlled
   asthma associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
   - f/u blood culture (NGTD), DFA negative
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 4211**], [**Name (NI) 4348**]  (pt has difficulty cooperating with meds)
   - Albuterol PRN
   - pt refusing CPAP / BiPAP
   .
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial, psych considering delirium
   because of poor orientation. Psych recs to stop Cogentin/Pimozide. Does
   not appear to be hypercarbic respiratory failure. Mental status appears
   to have improved from dialysis. Patient no longer requiring restraints
   as of [**3-28**] evening.  Could be consistent with absence seizures
   clinically. No OSH support this though.
   -          f/u EEG to r/o absence seizures
   -          no indication for LP (afebrile, no leukocytosis, MS
   improving)
   -          re c/s psych re: home regimen of psychi meds
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Colitis: Followed by GI, unlikely infectious source
   and pt not complaining of abdominal pain.  No diarrhea. CT scan from
   [**8-9**] shows similar findings.
   - d/c ABX ([**3-28**])
   - continue bowel regimen as tolerated
   .
   # CVID : Patient has been on IVIG therapy in the past but stopped this
   treatment approximately 2 years ago. Recent infusion had to be held as
   pt spiked temperature. Fever could be also due to IVIG transfusion,
   however it persisted 12 hr after transfusion. Doubt her acute
   presentation to be due to acute reaction, but should be discussed with
   blood bank. Supposedly, patient was getting IVIG treatment every other
   week with dialysis.
   - f/u cultures
   - will discuss with outpt team long-term goals/plans for treatment
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient is asymptomatic and current BP's are at her
   baseline (SBP 60-80).  Current BPs unreliable because taken with thigh
   cuff and unable to get a-line.  Pt
s mental status at baseline, can not
   follow UOP since relies on HD.
   - Continue Fludrocort & Midrodine as per home regimen
   - f/u blood cultures
   .
   # ESRD:  On dialysis, s/p cadaveric transplant. rejection at 13, TTS
   schedule, last HD on Sat.
   - renal to dialyze today ([**3-30**])
   - Continue scheduled HD on Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   - Continue Sevelamer
   .
   # DVT: Radiographic imaging and physical exam suggestive of extensive
   collaterals. Likely due to partial occlusion of SVC due to multiple
   lines and DVT. Not on any anticoagulation.
   - Will avoid subclavian/IJ central lines
   .
   # Mental illness: hx of anxiety and depression, lives in a group home;
   patient is unable to provide any additional details.
   - re c/s psych re: outpt psych meds
   - Social Work consult, further discussion re: med compliance, home
   needs
   - will limit psychotropic meds
   .
   # Prophylaxis:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - Continue home PPI
   - Bowel regimen
   .
   # FEN:
   - Residue free renal diet, although would limit PO intake given
   mental/respiratory status
   .
   # Access: Midline with two active ports
   .
   # Code status: Full code
   .
   # Dispo: Home facility vs. Rehab -> will discuss with case
   management/social work ->  aim for d/c [**3-31**]

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obesity, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and mental illness. She presents with altered mental status, respiratory failure, abdominal pain/colitis, hypotension, DVT, and anxiety/depression.

Assessment:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and asthma, which can lead to respiratory failure. She is currently experiencing hypoxia and has difficulty ventilating even with CPAP. Her baseline respiratory status is likely impaired due to obesity-related ventilation restriction.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient exhibits delirium with poor orientation, which could be multifactorial. It may be related to hypercarbic respiratory failure or absence seizures. An EEG is recommended to rule out absence seizures.
3. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: The patient's abdominal pain is unlikely to be infectious in origin as she is not complaining of diarrhea. No evidence of colitis is seen on imaging.
4. CVID: The patient has a history of CVID and was previously on IVIG therapy but stopped treatment two years ago. Recent infusion had to be held due to temperature spike, raising suspicion of an acute reaction. Further evaluation and discussion with the blood bank are needed.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is at her baseline ("

   Assessment and Plan
   22yo F with asthma COPD with stable hypoxia, ESRD on HD, CVID p/w AMS
   with delirium responsive to HD and holding benzos.
   # Respiratory failure: Hx of COPD, Asthma, and OSA: Hypoxia: Although
   patient responds to narcan, opiate overdose is unlikely given that pt
   only received 1 mg morphine on presentation. Given new fever perhaps
   this could be hypercarbic respiratory failure in the setting of
   pulmonary infection or chemical pneumonitis after emesis earlier during
   the day. Pt likely very hypercarbic at baseline given body habitus and
   obstructive/restrictive lung disease.  Pt hypoventilates even with
   CPAP.   Likely represents pt
s baseline respiratory status. Baseline
   sats 80-90s. Last PFT in [**9-/2146**]; moderate to severe proportionate
   decrease in flows and volumes with a strong bronchodilator response.
   Normal diffusion capacity. Features suggestive of poorly controlled
   asthma associated with obesity related ventillatory restriction.
   Patient has been refusing CPAP.
   - f/u blood culture (NGTD), DFA negative
   - Continue [**Name (NI) 4211**], [**Name (NI) 4348**]  (pt has difficulty cooperating with meds)
   - Albuterol PRN
   .
   # Altered mental status: multifactorial, psych considering delirium
   because of poor orientation. Psych recs to stop Cogentin/Pimozide. Does
   not appear to be hypercarbic respiratory failure. Mental status appears
   to have improved from dialysis. Patient no longer requiring restraints
   as of [**3-28**] evening.  Could be consistent with absence seizures
   clinically. No OSH support this though. EEG did not show any evidence
   of seizures, final read pending.
   no indication for LP (afebrile, no leukocytosis, MS improving)
   -          Psych feels that the patient is in delirium, stopped all
   benzos, on haldol, normal QT interval
   .
   # Abdominal pain/Colitis: Followed by GI, unlikely infectious source
   and pt not complaining of abdominal pain.  No diarrhea. CT scan from
   [**8-9**] shows similar findings. Patient was started cipro, flagyl on [**3-23**]
   and stopped on [**3-28**].
   .
   # CVID : Patient has been on IVIG therapy in the past but stopped this
   treatment approximately 2 years ago. Recent infusion had to be held as
   pt spiked temperature. Fever could be also due to IVIG transfusion,
   however it persisted 12 hr after transfusion. Doubt her acute

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old female with a history of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, common variable immune deficiency (CVID), and previous kidney transplant. She presented with altered mental status, fever, and respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, delirium responsive to haloperidol, improved mental status after dialysis, and no evidence of seizures on EEG. She also has abdominal pain, colitis, CVID, hypotension, ESRD, DVT, mental illness, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD, asthma, and OSA, which can contribute to respiratory failure. Her baseline respiratory status is likely impaired due to obesity-related ventilation restriction and poorly controlled asthma. The recent fever and chemical pneumonitis after emesis may indicate hypercarbic respiratory failure, especially given her refusal of CPAP.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is experiencing delirium, possibly multifactorial, with psychogenic factors and hypercarbic respiratory failure being considered. Mental status improvement has been observed after dialysis. The absence of seizures on EEG reduces the likelihood of absence seizures.

3. Abdominal Pain/Colitis: Although the patient's"
