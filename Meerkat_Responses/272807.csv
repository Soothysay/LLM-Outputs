","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, depression, esophageal varices, and portal hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient received a blood transfusion of approximately 500cc PRBC due to his low hemoglobin level. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8C (100.1F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/65 mmHg to 154/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but does not require supplemental oxygen. His physical examination reveals mild tenderness in the pelvic region, no wheezes or rales in the lungs, tachycardia with normal S1 + S2 heart sounds, and warm and well-perfused extremities. Laboratory results indicate an elevated leukocyte count, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's current medication includes antibiotics, ICU medications, and other medications. There are no changes to the medical and family history. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. He has been admitted multiple times for esophageal tears and gastritis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated heart rate. His laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and iron deficiency anemia. The patient's blood pressure is in the 150s systolic. He has a history of depression, alcoholic hepatitis, and recurrent syncope.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's presentation with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis suggests ongoing upper GI bleeding. This could lead to hypotension and shock if not managed promptly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This can manifest as altered mental status or confusion.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis increases the risk for renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and history of cirrhosis increase the risk for bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.
5. Infection: The patient's history of SBP prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin indicates a risk for"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presenting with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. He has a history of esophageal varices and previous admissions for tears and esophagitis/gastritis. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy that did not reveal varices, suggesting that the bleeding is not variceal in origin.

The patient has been diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and the differential diagnosis includes peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), Dieulafoy's lesion, and esophageal tear. He received a blood transfusion and is currently being managed with intravenous fluids (IVF) and blood products to maintain a hematocrit level above 25 and urine output at 30 cc/hr. Prophylactic antibiotics have been administered for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's acid-base status shows respiratory alkalosis with a normal anion gap. The initial high lactate levels have normalized, indicating adequate tissue perfusion. The serum toxicology screen was negative, and urine toxicology is pending.

The patient's liver disease includes alcoholic hepatitis, with elevated liver function tests (LFTs) and an AST level higher than ALT, consistent with alcohol abuse. The patient is also experiencing thromboc"

   multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears and esophagitis/gastritis who presents from home
   with one week of severe nausea, vomiting and coffee ground emesis.
   .
   Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable and EGD without visible
   evidence of bleeding in upper GI tract.  Possible that symptoms were
   due to frequent wretching.
   - active type and screen
   - liver consult for potential upper endoscopy
   - NPO for now
   - two units PRBCs now, aim to keep hematocrit > 25
   - IVF and blood for MAP > 65, UOP 30 cc/hr
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV BID for SBP prophylaxis
   .
   Acid Base Status:  ABG with respiratory alkalosis but anion gap is
   currently 26 suggesting a gap acidosis. Delta delta is significantly
   positive suggesting a secondary metabolic alkalosis (hypochloremic,
   hypokalemic likely secondary to vomiting).   Normal lactate.  Large
   acetone suggests alcoholic ketosis vs. starvation ketosis in the
   setting of normal serum glucose.  Negative serum toxicology screen,
   will send urine toxicology.  Serum osms pending.
   - will correct hypokalemia and give normal saline for volume depletion
   - IVF for ketosis with glucose
   - osm gap and urine toxicology pending
   - will check urine toxicology screen
   - will reasses acid base status after IVF
   .
   Alcoholic Hepatitis: History of ascites, SBP and portal vein
   thrombosis. RUQ ultrasound with evidence of patent flow in portal and
   splenic veins.
   - ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis in the setting of GI bleeding
   - will check transaminases, liver function
   - holding nadolol given bleeding
   - continue lactulose titrating to 3 bowel movements per day
   .
   Alcohol Abuse: Last drink one week ago.  Currently still tremulous.
   Toxicology screen negative.  No history of DTs or seizures.
   - valium CIWA
   - thiamine
   - folate
   - multivitamin
   - holding acamprosate for now

   Thrombocytopenia: Correlates well to his alcohol use.  Currently in the
   50s which is close to his baseline of 50s to 100s.
   - avoid heparin products
   - monitor platelets
   .
   Recurrent syncope:  Patient reports persistent syncopal episodes the
   week of presentation.  currently being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**], of
   Cardiology.  He has had multiple EKGs, long-term continuous loop
   monitoring and echocardiogam which have all been within normal limits.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**], no indication for further cardiac testing.  Concern
   that this may be related to alcohol use.
   - continue to monitor
   - will alert Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**] to patient's admission
   .
   Depression: Stable.
   - continue citalopram and seroquel
   .
   Hypertension: Blood pressures currently in 150s systolic.
   - holding nadolol given GI bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient underwent an upper endoscopy which did not reveal any active bleeding. He received 2 units of blood, and his hematocrit levels are stable. The patient is currently on IV fluids, antibiotics for SBP prophylaxis, and a proton pump inhibitor. His acid-base status indicates respiratory alkalosis with a secondary metabolic alkalosis. He has evidence of alcoholic ketosis. The patient's alcoholic hepatitis is being managed with lactulose for encephalopathy. His last drink was one week ago, and he is still tremulous but toxicology screen is negative. The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, recurrent syncope evaluated by cardiology, depression, hypertension, and iron deficiency anemia. The patient's current plan includes aggressive repletion of electrolytes, monitoring of platelets, and monitoring for syncopal episodes. He will be closely monitored in the ICU and then transferred to the floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. He presented to the hospital with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2째C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 146/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is alert and oriented but experiencing auditory hallucinations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to [Doctor First Name **] [Doctor Last Name **] tears and esophagitis/gastritis. He presented with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The endoscopy performed showed grade 3 esophagitis and gastropathy of the fundus with no active bleeding. The patient received 1 unit of blood, and his hematocrit is stable. However, there is a possibility of recurrent bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and portal vein thrombosis. He is currently showing signs of confusion and auditory hallucinations, which may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Hypokalemia: The patient's laboratory results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient's HCT is stable, and EGD shows no active bleeding. He has received 2 units of blood and is being monitored closely. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but he is tachycardic. Laboratory results show an elevated liver enzyme level, low albumin, and high bilirubin. The patient's kidney function is normal, and electrolyte levels are imbalanced. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of bleeding esophageal varices and gastritis, which can lead to upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and confusion.
3. Infection: The patient is at an increased risk of infections due to his compromised immune system as a result of chronic alcohol abuse and cirrhosis.
4. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which can lead to muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and abnormal heart rhythms.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
6. Hypertension: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assessment and Plan: 49 year old male with alcoholic cirrhosis and
   multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tears and esophagitis/gastritis who presents from home
   with one week of severe nausea, vomiting and coffee ground emesis.
   .
   Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding:  HCT stable and EGD without visible
   evidence of bleeding in upper GI tract.  Possible that symptoms were
   due to frequent wretching.
   - active type and screen
   - liver consult for potential upper endoscopy
   - NPO for now
   - two units PRBCs now, aim to keep hematocrit > 25
   - IVF and blood for MAP > 65, UOP 30 cc/hr
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **]
   - ciprofloxacin 400 mg IV BID for SBP prophylaxis
   .
   Acid Base Status:  ABG with respiratory alkalosis but anion gap is
   currently 26 suggesting a gap acidosis. Delta delta is significantly
   positive suggesting a secondary metabolic alkalosis (hypochloremic,
   hypokalemic likely secondary to vomiting).   Normal lactate.  Large
   acetone suggests alcoholic ketosis vs. starvation ketosis in the
   setting of normal serum glucose.  Negative serum toxicology screen,
   will send urine toxicology.  Serum osms pending.
   - will correct hypokalemia and give normal saline for volume depletion
   - IVF for ketosis with glucose
   - osm gap and urine toxicology pending
   - will check urine toxicology screen
   - will reasses acid base status after IVF
   .
   Alcoholic Hepatitis: History of ascites, SBP and portal vein
   thrombosis. RUQ ultrasound with evidence of patent flow in portal and
   splenic veins.
   - ciprofloxacin for SBP prophylaxis in the setting of GI bleeding
   - will check transaminases, liver function
   - holding nadolol given bleeding
   - continue lactulose titrating to 3 bowel movements per day
   .
   Alcohol Abuse: Last drink one week ago.  Currently still tremulous.
   Toxicology screen negative.  No history of DTs or seizures.
   - valium CIWA
   - thiamine
   - folate
   - multivitamin
   - holding acamprosate for now
   .
   Thrombocytopenia: Correlates well to his alcohol use.  Currently in the
   50s which is close to his baseline of 50s to 100s.
   - avoid heparin products
   - monitor platelets
   .
   Recurrent syncope:  Patient reports persistent syncopal episodes the
   week of presentation.  currently being evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**], of
   Cardiology.  He has had multiple EKGs, long-term continuous loop
   monitoring and echocardiogam which have all been within normal limits.
   Per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**], no indication for further cardiac testing.  Concern
   that this may be related to alcohol use.
   - continue to monitor
   - will alert Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4345**] to patient's admission
   .
   Depression: Stable.
   - continue citalopram and seroquel
   .
   Hypertension: Blood pressures currently in 150s systolic.
   - holding nadolol given GI bleeding
   .
   Iron deficiency anemia:  Baseline hematocrits ranging from 25-30.
   Documented iron deficiency in the past.
   - transfusion goal < 25
   - continue iron supplements

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient received one unit of blood, and his hematocrit levels are stable. An endoscopy was performed without any significant findings. The patient has been restarted on nadolol, and his allergies include Lasix (oral) with a rash. He has been receiving midazolam, fentanyl, and pantoprazole in the ICU. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 38.1째C (100.5째F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/81 mmHg to 173/111 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented, but experiencing auditory hallucinations about his mother outside of his room. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.4 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL, sodium level of 116 mg/dL, potassium level of 2 mg/dL, and a slightly elevated lactate level of 1.1 mmol/L. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), alkaline phosphatase, total bilir"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleed: The patient has experienced a significant GI bleed, which is attributed to a possible variceal source. They have received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) transfusion.

2. Cirrhosis: The patient may have cirrhosis, as evidenced by the mention of possible encephalopathy. This is supported by the presence of confusion and hallucinations, which could be related to liver dysfunction.

3. Confusion and hallucinations: The patient is experiencing confusion and auditory hallucinations (hearing their mother's voice). These symptoms could be attributed to alcohol withdrawal, medication side effects, or liver-related encephalopathy.

4. Tachycardia: The patient has an elevated heart rate, which is likely due to hypovolemia resulting from the GI bleed. The use of beta-blockers has been discontinued, and nadalol has been resumed to manage tachycardia.

5. Fluid imbalance: The patient has a fluid imbalance, as indicated by the net fluid loss of 1,409 mL over the past 24 hours. This could be due to ongoing GI bleeding, insensible losses, or other factors.

6. Nutritional support: The patient is currently receiving nutritional support through parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to their inability"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed). The patient has undergone an endoscopy to identify the source of bleeding, which was found to be from an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source, possibly variceal. The patient has received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion. The patient's medical history includes cirrhosis, confusion, hallucinations, possible alcohol-related encephalopathy, and potential medication-related confusion. Nutritional support has been initiated through oral intake with multivitamins, folate, and thiamine supplementation. Tachycardia is attributed to hypovolemia, and the patient is being repleted with fluids. Depression is also noted, and usual medications for it are being continued.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: Despite receiving PRBC transfusion, there is still a risk of re-bleeding due to the underlying cause of the GI bleed, such as varices or other UGI pathology.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and hallucinations may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of cirrhosis. Monitoring and management of this condition are essential.
3. Infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infections.

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and recent presentation with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient's current condition includes agitation/hallucinations consistent with alcohol withdrawal, stable hematocrit, and no visible evidence of bleeding in the upper GI tract. The patient also has a history of ascites, SBP, and portal vein thrombosis, as well as recurrent syncope being evaluated by cardiology. Other medical issues include thrombocytopenia, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and electrolyte imbalances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of agitation and hallucinations, which are consistent with alcohol withdrawal. This can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium tremens, and even death if not properly managed.
2. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Although the patient has had an EGD without visible evidence of bleeding, there is a risk of re-bleeding due to his history of alcoholic cirrhosis and previous admissions for GI bleeding.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and liver disease, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as altered mental status, confusion, and changes in behavior.
4. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to chronic liver disease, making him more susceptible to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient has been diagnosed with alcohol abuse, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, alcoholic hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, recurrent syncope, hypertension, and iron deficiency anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and even coma.
2. Variceal Bleeding: Although esophageal varices were not seen during the EGD, the patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to esophagitis/gastritis. Variceal bleeding is a potential complication that needs to be monitored for.
3. Infection: The patient is on antibiotics for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. Infection can still occur, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
4. Hepatorenal Syndrome: Given the patient's history of liver disease and potential fluid overload, hepatorenal syndrome (a type of kidney failure) may develop.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's thrombocytopenia and prolonged PTT/INR indicate a risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and appropriate management is"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and ethanol (EtOH) withdrawal/delirium tremens (DT). The patient has been experiencing auditory hallucinations and exhibiting aggressive behavior. They have been hypertensive and diaphoretic, requiring four-point restraints. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 154/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and attentive, following simple commands. They respond to verbal stimuli and are oriented. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and normal cardiovascular findings. The patient has soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and no rashes or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows normal tone, movement, and no paralysis. Laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT), elevated bilirubin levels, and low albumin. The patient has received multiple units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently receiving lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepines for withdrawal symptoms, nutritional support, and fluids for hypovolemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding, and there is a risk of rebleeding, which can be life-threatening.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with complaints of gastrointestinal bleeding and ethanol withdrawal/delirium tremens. The patient continues to experience auditory hallucinations and exhibits belligerent behavior. There is no seizure activity reported. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37째C, heart rate between 95-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-173/36-126 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is sedated and oriented to self and time.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient with no acute distress. The patient has no signs of overweight or obesity, thinness, anxiety, or diaphoresis. The cardiovascular examination shows normal findings with no murmurs or abnormal heart sounds. The respiratory examination is clear bilaterally. The abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. No distention or tenderness is noted. The extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination reveals a sedated patient who is attentive and follows simple commands.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, leukocyte count of 52 K/uL, platelet count of 116 mg/dL, sodium level of 0.5 mg/dL, potassium level of 24 mEq/L, glucose level of 4 mg/dL, and serum creatinine level of 32.0%. Other lab values are within normal range.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's initial presentation with gastrointestinal bleeding indicates a potential complication related to the digestive system. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
2. Ethanol withdrawal/delirium tremens: The patient's symptoms of auditory hallucinations and belligerent behavior suggest withdrawal from ethanol, which can lead to delirium tremens. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent complications associated with this condition.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may increase the risk of organ dysfunction and poor perfusion. Monitoring and management of blood pressure are crucial to prevent complications.
4. Potential infection: Although not explicitly stated in the progress note, the presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) could indicate a potential infection. Further investigation and appropriate management are required to prevent complications.
5. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a negative balance of 1,889 mL over 24 hours. This indicates a potential fluid deficit that needs to be addressed to prevent complications related to dehydration or hypovolemia.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, esophageal varices, and portal hypertension. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to gastrointestinal bleeding, EtOH withdrawal, and other medical complications. He has required sedation and restraints, and has shown agitation and hallucinations consistent with prior withdrawls. His liver disease is being monitored, and he is receiving thiamine, folate, and multivitamins. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is stable, and an EGD showed no visible evidence of bleeding. The patient is also being treated for alcoholic hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, recurrent syncope, hypertension, iron deficiency anemia, and electrolyte imbalance. Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, PPI, and lactulose. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and he will be kept in the ICU until his mental status improves and withdrawls are under control."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding, depression, esophageal varices, and portal hypertension. He presents with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. The patient's agitation and hallucinations are consistent with his prior alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB secondary to alcoholic liver disease and esophagitis/gastritis. He presented with one week of severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not show any visible evidence of bleeding in the upper GI tract.

2. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's agitation and hallucinations are consistent with his prior alcohol withdrawal episodes. He has required IV lorazepam (Ativan) for sedation and to manage withdrawal symptoms.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is consistent with his liver disease. It is important to monitor platelet levels and avoid heparin products due to the risk of bleeding.

4. Recurrent Syncope: The patient reports persistent syncopal episodes. Cardiac evaluation by a cardiologist has been conducted, including EKGs, long-term continuous loop monitoring, and echocardiogram, all of which have been within normal limits"

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and multiple admissions for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with severe nausea, vomiting, and coffee ground emesis. He has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophagitis/gastritis. The patient also has a history of depression and esophageal varices. He was experiencing agitation and hallucinations, which have now resolved with the administration of Ativan (lorazepam). 

Medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can recur due to his cirrhotic liver and esophageal varices.
2. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient's last drink was one week ago, but his mother reported that he had a drink on the day of admission. He experienced agitation and hallucinations, which are signs of alcohol withdrawal. Monitoring for further withdrawal symptoms is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a history of thrombocytopenia, which is common in liver disease. It is important to monitor his platelet count and avoid heparin products.
4. Recurrent syncope: The patient reports persistent syncopal episodes, and further evaluation by a cardiologist is recommended to determine the cause, possibly autonomic dysfunction or peripheral neuropathy related to alcohol abuse.
5. Hypertension: The patient has labile blood pressure fluctuations due"
