","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, currently admitted to the ICU for acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient has been on supplemental oxygen for the past few years and had a previous intubation about a year ago. There was no clear preceding prodrome, fever, or chills, but there was a change in sputum color. The patient has metabolic compensation for respiratory acidosis and is suspected to have had a slowly progressing decompensation. Treatment includes IV solumedrol, prednisone, azithromycin, round-the-clock nebs, BIPAP overnight, and consideration for home BIPAP. The patient's respiratory acidosis is being treated with BIPAP, and pressure support will be increased as necessary. Other medical conditions include hyperlipidemia, diabetes, dementia, and depression. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to exacerbation of COPD: The patient's history of COPD and current acute exacerbation puts them at risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is crucial.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished individual without acute distress. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient presented with an acute exacerbation of severe COPD, likely exacerbated by excessive supplemental oxygen in the emergency department. There is no clear evidence for pneumonia or infection, but there was a change in sputum color as per the family. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 108 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 158/129 to 137 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on BiPAP.

The patient is receiving several medications including lisinopril, pravastatin, azithromycin, albuterol, atrovent, prednisone, insulin sliding scale, famotidine, and subcutaneous heparin. The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels at 292 mg/dL, slightly low sodium levels at 132 mEq/L, normal potassium levels at 4.9 mEq/L, and low hemoglobin levels at 10.0 mg/dL. The chest X-ray reveals hyperinflation and diaphragmatic flattening, indicating chronic lung disease. Blood cultures have been negative to date.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, respiratory failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and hyperglycemia due to the use of steroids. The patient's COPD exacerbation may progress to respiratory failure if not adequately managed. The use of steroids can lead to hyperglycemia, which is already evident with the elevated glucose levels. Additionally, the patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk for DVT, and the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis is important to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for signs of VAP is crucial as the patient is on BiPAP support in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   #  ACUTE COPD EXACERBATION: Patient with longstanding COPD, on
   supplemental oxygen for the past few years, with single prior
   intubation about 1 year ago (x ~1 week). No clear preceeding prodrome,
   no fevers or chills however sputum color change. Viral screen negative.
   Given degree of acidosis with metabolic compensation, suspect this has
   been a slowly progressing decompensation.  CXR this morning looks
   clear.  However she is desatting to 60% with cough/movement on rounds.
   -- BIPAP currently
   -- IV solumedrol given in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue prednisone 60mg PO
   -- Azithromycin x 5 days (day #[**2-26**])
   -- Round the clock nebs- albuterol q2prn, atrovent q6
   -- Needs BIPAP at night
   -- Will tirate PS as necessary, CO2 goal ~60
   --Goal O2 sat 88-93%
   -- If not improving in the next 24 hrs, would consider CTA PE as this
   is commonly implicated in exacerbations.
   -
   #Tachycardia- Sinus on EKG but currently going on bigeminy. [**Month (only) 11**] be
   related to steroids/albuterol frequency vs possibility of PE vs
   hypovolemia
   --500cc bolus now
   -- Low suspicion for PE
   -- Order LENIs
   .
   #  RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS: Given degree of compensation, suspect chronic
   process. Will treat CO2 retention with BIPAP
   -- ABG improved CO2; likely chronically retains
   .
   #  HYPERLIPIDEMIA: Continue pravastatin
   .
   #  DIABETES: Sliding scale insulin, would expect for blood glucose to
   be more difficult to control in setting of steroid use.
   -- q6h fingerstick
   .
   # DEMENTIA: Baseline high functioning, will continue to follow
   .
   # DEPRESSION: Continue setraline, Trazodone

","The patient is an elderly female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. She is currently admitted to the ICU for an acute exacerbation of her COPD. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/63 mmHg to 158/129 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. 

The patient has been experiencing desaturation episodes, particularly during eating or movement, and has shown signs of shortness of breath. An arterial blood gas (ABG) test revealed a pH level of 7.41, indicating respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), glucose, and potassium, as well as decreased levels of hemoglobin (Hct) and platelets (Plt). 

The patient's physical examination findings include diminished breath sounds in the chest, symmetric expansion of the lungs, and no evidence of lower extremity edema. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Acute COPD Exacerbation: The patient is suspected to have an acute exacerbation of her COPD, with no clear preceding prodrome. Viral screen negative. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen and being treated with BiPAP, IV solumedrol, pred"

   ------ Protected Section ------
   Attending Note: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 8379**] for the key portions of the services provided.
   I agree with the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   Severe O2-dependent COPD, FEV1 0.5, known to Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **], pHTN, DM,
   admitted with respiratory distress and change in sputum. Initial ABG in
   ED notable for pCO2 98 on NRB but improved with BiPAP. Treated as
   pneumonia and acute exacerbation of COPD. Ruled out for flu.
   Remains tachypneic and tachycardic, in sinus rhythm 110s with no
   obvious cause. Agree with ruling out PE with CTA although she has been
   on prophylaxis and LENIs negative. Will hydrate pre-CT to minimize
   renal toxicity. Creatinine very near baseline at 1.1, GFR 58. Mild
   increase in creatinine may be related to autodiuresis (- 2L / 24 h
   yesterday).
   Acute respiratory failure: agree with continuing intermittent BiPAP as
   needed, nebs and prednisone 60 mg.
   Patient remains critically ill and will therefore remain in the ICU.
   Time spent 33 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 1512**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1513**], MD
   on:[**2179-2-22**] 18:28 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation. The patient's current condition includes tachycardia, increased shortness of breath, and a previous ABG showing high PCO2 levels. The patient is currently on bipap and seems more comfortable. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and high PCO2 levels indicate a possibility of respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum shows oral flora, which could suggest an infection such as pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is on prophylaxis for DVT, being critically ill and immobilized increases the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins.
4. Delirium: The patient's sedation and paralysis may increase the risk of delirium, which is a common complication in critically ill patients.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility in the ICU can lead to pressure ulcers, especially in areas where pressure is applied.
6. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's use of bipap and other respiratory support increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation.
7. Renal dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate mild renal impairment, which can wors"

The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema. The patient presented with an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient was started on azithromycin, prednisone, intermittent bipap, and increased frequency of albuterol. The patient's vital signs were monitored, and they were found to be tachycardic in the 110s, complaining of increased shortness of breath (SOB), and with improved ABG with PCO2 in the 50s. The patient's respiratory support included using a bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode, Vt of 440 mL, PS of 10 cmH2O, RR of 26, PEEP of 4 cmH2O, FiO2 of 24%, PIP of 16 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 88%. The patient's physical examination revealed no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with scattered faint wheezes, and warm skin. The patient's laboratory results showed elevated WBC count, slightly low Hct, normal Plt, elevated Cr, and abnormal blood gases. Imaging and microbiology tests were negative. The patient's condition is being continuously monitored, and they are currently in the ICU.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old woman with a history of COPD, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. She was admitted with an acute COPD exacerbation and is now improved on BIPAP. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a decreased breath sound on the right side. She is still experiencing intermittent tachycardia and desaturation episodes. The chest X-ray shows an architectural distortion in the right upper lobe with a spiculated 14 x 11 x 8 mm opacity, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient is on supplemental oxygen, prednisone, azithromycin, nebs with albuterol and atrovent, and insulin for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of COPD and the current exacerbation increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's hypertension and the use of steroids may increase the risk of cardiac complications like myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure.
3. Malignancy: The presence of a spiculated opacity on the chest X-ray raises concern for lung cancer. Further evaluation and discussion with the patient and family regarding goals of care will be necessary.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk of developing DVT due to prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and depression. She was admitted to the ICU due to an acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 100/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is currently receiving supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and is on BiPAP for respiratory support.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including a CT angiography (CTA) to evaluate for pulmonary embolism (PE), which showed architectural distortion in the lung apices and a spiculated opacity in the right upper lobe, raising concern for primary malignancy. Other findings from the CTA included thyroid nodules, cholelithiasis, and vascular and coronary calcifications.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose (292 mg/dL) and slightly decreased hemoglobin (9.5 g/dL). Her white blood cell count is within normal range, with a slight decrease in platelet count.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, along with an acute exacerbation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/67 to 200/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient is receiving various medications including lisinopril, azithromycin, aspirin, ipratropium, prednisone, insulin, famotidine, heparin, Advair, trazodone, Zoloft, and senna as needed.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelets. However, the blood glucose levels are elevated at 292 mg/dL. The creatinine level is within normal range, and other electrolyte levels are also normal. The imaging shows a nodule in the right upper lobe of the lung, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient tested positive for MRSA.

Plan:
The patient's assessment includes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, possible mass in the right upper lobe of the lung (highly concerning for malignancy), diabetes mellitus, and nutrition management. The patient is to continue on"
