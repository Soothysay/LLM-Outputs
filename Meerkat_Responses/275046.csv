   Assessment and Plan
   40M unknown PMH presents after MVC as unrestrained driver, found to
   have foreign body in esophagus and cecum, intubated for agitation.
   .
   # Foreign body: Located within esophagus and cecum. GI on board.  Will
   likely extract the coin today.  Unclear circumstances surrounding
   ingestion, could be due to collision although similar cecal foreign
   body suggests prior intentional ingestion.
   - GI consulted, endoscopic intervention today
   - Remain intubated on propofol GI intervention
   - Clarify history with patient once extubated
   .
   # MVC: No clear traumatic injuries from head on crash with tree and
   unrestrained driver. Some indication that may have been suicide
   attempt.
   - f/u final CT scan reads
   - Psych consult once extubated to determine circumstances around
   accident
   - Appreciate SW help in obtaining family information
   .
   # Tox screen: Positive for benzos and agitated in ED concerning for
   intoxication or withdrawal, although no current signs after receiving
   ativan and propofol. EtOH negative on arrival.
   - Follow for signs withdrawal
   - Continue propofol
   - Ativan prn for agitation or CIWA>10
   - Thiamine IV, folate
   .
   # Sinus bradycardia: Likely due to sedation from benzos and propofol.
   Will lighten and monitor on tele. Check 12-lead ECG to confirm tele
   monitoring.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 40-year-old male with an unknown medical history who presented after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). 
- He was found to have foreign bodies in his esophagus and cecum. 
- The patient was intubated due to agitation and is currently sedated with propofol. 
- There are concerns about the circumstances surrounding the ingestion of the foreign bodies, with possible intentional ingestion. 
- The patient tested positive for benzodiazepines and was agitated in the emergency department, but showed no signs of intoxication or withdrawal after receiving lorazepam and propofol. 
- A CT scan of the head is pending to rule out any traumatic injuries from the MVC. 
- The patient's family history is significant for a suicide attempt by the patient's mother and the patient's recent abnormal behavior. 
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/64 to 77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 
- The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, platelet count of 237 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and glucose level of 83 mg/dL. 
- The patient is expected to remain in the ICU until the foreign body removal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the foreign body in the esophagus, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia if the foreign body dislodges or the patient vomits while intubated.
2. Sepsis: If the foreign bodies in the esophagus and cecum become infected, it can lead to sepsis, especially considering the patient's compromised immune status due to benzodiazepine intoxication.
3. Acute kidney injury: Prolonged use of propofol and other medications may cause acute kidney injury, particularly if the patient has pre-existing kidney dysfunction.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP, a type of lung infection.
5. Bleeding complications: The use of anticoagulant therapy with heparin for DVT prophylaxis may increase the risk of bleeding complications, especially if the patient's platelet count is low or if there is any invasive procedure performed.
6. Stress ulceration: The patient's critical illness and prolonged ICU stay may increase the risk of stress ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Withdrawal syndrome: The patient's positive tox screen for benzodiazepines and history of agitation raise concerns for benzodiazepine withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications if not managed appropriately.
8. Cardiovascular complications: Sinus br"

   40M unknown PMH presents after MVC as unrestrained driver, found to
   have foreign body in esophagus and cecum, intubated for agitation.
   .
   # Foreign body: Located within esophagus and cecum. GI thinks likely
   coin and may pass spontaneously, although somewhat unusual egg-shaped
   appearance on pa/lat CXR. Unclear circumstances surrounding ingestion,
   could be due to collision although similar cecal foreign body suggests
   prior intentional ingestion.
   - GI consulted, would like serial CXR, may need endoscopic intervention
   if not passing, low concern for precipitating ulceration or perforation
   and do not believe it is a battery, will see in AM
   - Remain intubated on propofol until f/u CXR performed and contact GI
   - Clarify history with patient once extubated

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He was found to have foreign bodies in his esophagus and cecum. He was intubated due to agitation and is currently sedated on propofol. The foreign bodies are likely a coin and may pass spontaneously, although they have an unusual egg-shaped appearance on the chest X-ray. The patient's history is unclear regarding the ingestion of the foreign bodies, whether it was accidental or intentional. GI consultation was sought, and it is planned to perform serial chest X-rays. If the foreign bodies do not pass, endoscopic intervention may be necessary. There is low concern for ulceration or perforation, and it does not appear to be a battery. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/64 mmHg to 77/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 580 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, and peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O. His ABG results show pH 7.35, PaCO2 42 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 166. The patient has positive tox screen for benzodiazepines and was agitated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC) with a foreign body in his esophagus and cecum. He was intubated for agitation and has since been extubated. The patient has a history of benzodiazepine use and is suspected to be withdrawing from them. He has been given additional doses of Haldol and Ativan to manage agitation. The patient's allergies include antibiotics, and he is currently on various medications such as pantoprazole, heparin, haloperidol, lorazepam, and diazepam. His vital signs are stable, but he has a fever of 100.4°F. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, and he has been advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. His blood work shows elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's physical examination is mostly unremarkable, except for absent radial and distal pulses on the right side. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Benzo withdrawal: The patient's history of benzodiazepine use and the current symptoms of agitation suggest the possibility of benzodiazepine withdrawal. This can lead to severe complications such as seizures, delirium, and agitation.
2. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count indicate a potential infection. Infections can be particularly concerning"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of agitation and aggression. The patient has a history of self-harm and suicide attempts. On the first day, the patient underwent an upper endoscopy, during which foreign bodies were found in the esophagus and removed. The patient tolerated the procedure well.

Subsequently, the patient was placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. However, the patient was successfully extubated but remained agitated, spitting at security personnel and requiring restraints. The patient received haloperidol and ativan to manage agitation, but continued to be agitated throughout the night. It was suspected that the patient may be experiencing benzodiazepine withdrawal, as he reported taking 10 mg of Klonopin and 10 Xanax daily.

The patient's vital signs were monitored, showing an elevated temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) and blood pressure ranging from 119/80 mmHg to 164/80 mmHg. The patient's heart rate was consistently above 100 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was within normal limits. Oxygen saturation remained above 95%.

Fluid balance showed an intake of 2,337 mL and output of 1,325 mL, resulting in a balance of 1,012 mL. The patient received various medications, including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, haloperidol,"

   Assessment and Plan
   40M unknown PMH presents after MVC as unrestrained driver, found to
   have foreign body in esophagus and cecum, intubated for agitation.
   .
   # Foreign body: Located within esophagus and cecum. GI on board.  Will
   likely extract the coin today.  Unclear circumstances surrounding
   ingestion, could be due to collision although similar cecal foreign
   body suggests prior intentional ingestion.
   - GI consulted, endoscopic intervention today
   - Remain intubated on propofol GI intervention
   - Clarify history with patient once extubated
   .
   # MVC: No clear traumatic injuries from head on crash with tree and
   unrestrained driver. Some indication that may have been suicide
   attempt.
   - f/u final CT scan reads
   - Psych consult once extubated to determine circumstances around
   accident
   - Appreciate SW help in obtaining family information
   .
   # Tox screen: Positive for benzos and agitated in ED concerning for
   intoxication or withdrawal, although no current signs after receiving
   ativan and propofol. EtOH negative on arrival.
   - Follow for signs withdrawal
   - Continue propofol
   - Ativan prn for agitation or CIWA>10
   - Thiamine IV, folate
   .
   # Sinus bradycardia: Likely due to sedation from benzos and propofol.
   Will lighten and monitor on tele. Check 12-lead ECG to confirm tele
   monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 40-year-old male who presented to the ICU after a motor vehicle collision (MVC). He was found to have a foreign body in his esophagus and cecum. The patient was intubated for agitation and is currently sedated on propofol. There is uncertainty regarding the circumstances surrounding the ingestion of the foreign bodies, with possible intentional ingestion being considered. The patient's history is unclear, and there are indications that the MVC may have been a suicide attempt. The patient's tox screen was positive for benzodiazepines, and he is being monitored for signs of withdrawal. His blood glucose levels are within normal range, and he has received thiamine and folate. The patient's sinus bradycardia is likely due to sedation from benzodiazepines and propofol. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact circumstances of the MVC and to assess the patient's mental health status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the presence of a foreign body in the esophagus, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia if the foreign body dislodges or if the patient vomits while intubated.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): Prolonged hypotension or inadequate fluid resuscitation can lead to AKI, which may be indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
3. Delirium or agitation: Withdrawal from benzodiazepines"
