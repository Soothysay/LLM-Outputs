","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who has undergone three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He is not a surgical candidate for further intervention according to cardiac surgery. The patient is experiencing episodes of chest and left shoulder pain, which are treated as musculoskeletal pain. He is currently receiving nitroglycerin, heparin, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease with one graft patent. Intervention is planned for Monday. The patient's chest and left shoulder pain could be indicative of angina or myocardial ischemia.
2. Pump Dysfunction: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 55%, indicating mildly reduced cardiac function. Echocardiogram shows distal septal hypokinesis, suggesting regional wall motion abnormality. Close monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent heart failure.
3. Arrhythmia: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm. Continuous monitoring is required to detect any changes in heart rhythm.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes management should include checking HbA1c levels, holding glyburide and metformin while in the hospital, and adjusting insulin doses as needed.
5. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient requires a high-dose statin for cholesterol management, along with gemfibrozil and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who has undergone three coronary artery bypass graft surgeries (CABG). He is not a surgical candidate according to cardiac surgery. The patient presented with chest and left shoulder pain, which was initially treated as musculoskeletal pain but could potentially be related to angina. The patient is currently on nitroglycerin, heparin, and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has severe three-vessel disease with only one graft patent. There is a plan for intervention on Monday. The patient's episodes of chest and left shoulder pain may be indicative of ongoing ischemia or angina.
2. Pump failure: The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 55%, indicating some degree of left ventricular dysfunction. There is distal septal hypokinesis observed on the echocardiogram. Continuous monitoring of the patient's fluid status is necessary.
3. Rhythm disturbance: The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus, but ongoing monitoring is required to detect any changes that may require intervention.
4. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed by checking HbA1c levels, holding glyburide and metformin while in the hospital, and adjusting insulin sliding scale.
5. Hypercholesterolemia: The patient requires high-dose statin therapy, continuation of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) three times. He is currently in the ICU due to chest pain and left shoulder pain, and has been experiencing recurring fevers since January 1st. He was started on IV vancomycin, and his WBC count is elevated at 10.1 today. The patient also has abdominal pain, hypertension, and anemia with a Hct of 24.9. He has an IABP in place and is being monitored for cardiac catheterization. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses blood transfusions.

Potential medical complications:
1. Coronary artery disease: The patient's severe 3V disease with one patent graft may lead to recurrent chest pain and potentially acute coronary syndrome.
2. Infection: The patient's recurring fevers, elevated WBC count, and abdominal pain suggest a possible infection. The presence of fever spikes despite antibiotic treatment raises concerns for resistant or unidentified infections.
3. Hypertension: The patient experienced an episode of hypertension to 170s, which can increase the risk of end-organ damage.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct of 24.9 indicates anemia, which can worsen due to ongoing bleeding from the IABP site and refusal of blood transfusions.
5. Thrombosis: The patient's use of anticoagulants (hepar"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old man admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of being a Jehovah's Witness, which affects blood transfusion decisions. The patient has been experiencing recurrent fevers, with temperatures ranging from 102 to 103.7 degrees Fahrenheit. He also complains of abdominal pain with rebound tenderness and has undergone several tests including a chest X-ray, abdominal X-ray, and cultures. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 148/60 to 170s. His heart rate is within normal limits, but he has had episodes of bleeding from the IABP site, which has been managed with pressure dressings. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery, with an SpO2 level of 96%. His ABG results show a pH of 7.49, indicating respiratory alkalosis. The patient's abdominal examination reveals mild distention and voluntary guarding, with tenderness to palpation throughout but most pronounced in the lower left quadrant. His extremities are well perfused without any color changes, and his neurologic examination is unremarkable. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The recurrent fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could progress to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Abdominal infection: The abdominal pain with rebound tenderness may indicate an intra-abdominal infection or abs"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who underwent triple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is currently in the ICU due to various medical complications. His chief complaint is fever and abdominal pain. The patient's temperature has been consistently elevated, with spikes up to 103.7 degrees Celsius. He also has a history of hypertension and chest pain. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is not a surgical candidate, and further cardiac catheterization is planned. However, it has been postponed due to the patient's febrile state and concern for possible balloon infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's recurring fevers and abdominal pain suggest an ongoing infection. The source of infection may be related to the balloon placed during his previous hospitalization. Broadening antibiotic coverage was recommended by the surgical team.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of severe coronary artery disease and previous CABG. His chest pain and elevated troponin T levels indicate possible cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction. Further evaluation through cardiac catheterization is needed.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's laboratory results show abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. This could be due to dehydration, sepsis, or pre-existing renal disease.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin (H"

   disease with 1 graft patent.  Plan for cardiac catheterization with Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 7145**] on [**1-2**], but because he was febrile on [**1-1**],  cath is delayed
   until [**1-4**].  IABP was pulled on [**1-2**].  Nitro gtt was discontinued on
   [**1-2**].  This am, patient had another episode of chest pain this AM,
   requiring sublingual NTG.  Nitro gtt restarted this morning.  Currently
   chest pain free.
   - heparin gtt on hold given hct drop
   - Cardiac catheterization tomorrow on Wednesday
   - Integrillin/Plavix held for now
   - continue Metoprolol 12.5mg PO BID as tolerated by BP and HR
   - High dose statin, ASA
   .
   #. Anemia: hct down to 22.8 from 27.8. Patient  Guaiac negative. All
   three lines are down, indicating hemodilution also plays a role.  Given
   severe CAD with active chest pain, hct goal is 30 but patient is
   refusing pRBC
s given religious beliefs (Jehovah
s Witness).
   - start epo today
   - start Fe supplementation
   - send Iron studies
   - heparin gtt on hold, continue to hold given hct drop
   - Trend CBC, PM Hct
   - Fluid resuscitation PRN with IVF
   .
   #. Fever: Patient with recurring fevers on [**1-1**] on Tylenol for which he
   was started on IV Vancomycin because IABP was in place.  IABP was
   pulled on [**1-2**]. Blood cultures, urine cultures from [**1-1**] & [**1-2**] no
   growth to date. U/A
s x 2 negative. Also with complaint of abdominal
   pain on [**1-1**] but KUB and abdominal CT scan non-informative. CXR clear.
   WBC trending down.  Patient had no fevers on [**1-2**], but this morning
   during rounds had another temperature of 101.3.
   - continue vanc/cipro/flagyl for now
   - continue to follow WBC and fever curve
   - send UA, urine cx and blood cx
   - F/U all cx
   .
   #. ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  creatinine bumped from 1.0 to 1.3 today.
   Likely pre-renal given NPO yesterday and fever/insensible loss
   - send UA and urine lytes
   - IVF today (D5 1/2NS 1L at 100cc/hr)
   - continue to trend
   .
   #. PUMP: ECHO with distal septal hypokinesis, EF 55%. Appears euvolemic
   on exam without evidence of failure.
   - Continue to assess fluid status
   - continue BB and captopril
   .
   #. RHYTHM: Patient in sinus rhythm, but has lots of PVCs.
   - make sure to replete K and Mg
   - continue to monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. DIABETES:  hemoglobin A1c 8.0
   - Continue to hold home Glyburide, Metformin
   - HISS, titrate PRN
   .
   #. HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA: Total cholesterol 117, HDL 31, LDL 54
   - Continue Atorvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue Gemfibrizol 600mg [**Hospital1 7**]
   - Continue Ezetimibe 10mg daily
   .
   #. Chronic Pain: Patient has old left shoulder pain (10 years +),
   current right shoulder pain (3 days +) and back pain. He has an
   overlapping musculoskeletal pain syndrome that can be worrisome for the
   pain of angina. His presentation begun with a piercing left chest pain.
   Oxycodone was changed to standing and continue 2mg IV morphine for
   breakthrough
   - EKG

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note
   and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 1050**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 31**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4847**], MD
   on:[**2113-1-3**] 15:20 ------
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is currently in the ICU due to unstable angina, with severe 3-vessel disease and one patent graft. The patient has been experiencing recurring fevers, and blood cultures have shown no growth to date. He also has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 21.9%, likely due to hemodilution and active chest pain. The patient is refusing packed red blood cell transfusion due to religious beliefs (Jehovah's Witness). 

The patient's renal function has declined, as indicated by an increase in creatinine from 1.0 to 1.3. This could be attributed to pre-renal factors, including NPO status, fever, and insensible losses. 

The patient's cardiac function appears to be relatively preserved, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 55% on echocardiography. However, he is experiencing bigeminy and has a history of PVCs. 

Other medical issues include poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic pain syndromes. 

The patient's current treatment plan involves continued administration of vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole for fever, as well as initiation of erythropoietin (epo) and iron supplementation"

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who has undergone three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He is not a surgical candidate per CT surgery. The patient's medical history includes chronic pain, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension.

The patient was admitted with chest pain and was found to have an infection in the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) line. The IABP was subsequently removed. The patient also developed a fever, for which he was started on IV vancomycin. Blood cultures and urine cultures were obtained, but no growth was detected. The patient's abdominal pain is still being evaluated, with negative urinalysis and a non-informative abdominal CT scan.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 27.9% to 21.9%, indicating anemia. The patient is refusing blood transfusion due to religious beliefs (Jehovah's Witness). His cardiac catheterization has been delayed until January 5th.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.4°F (39.1°C), blood pressure ranging from 146/67 to 93/44 mmHg, heart rate between 65-90 bpm, respiratory rate of 11-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving heparin via gtt for DVT prophylaxis"

- The patient is currently experiencing chest pain, fever, and has had an IABP (Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump) stopped.
- The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 27.9 to 21.9 due to hemodilution and is refusing packed red blood cells (pRBC) based on religious beliefs (Jehovah's Witness).
- The patient's white blood cell count (WBC) is trending down, and blood cultures are negative to date.
- The patient's ejection fraction (EF) on echocardiogram is 55%, indicating good heart function.
- The patient has a history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient's severe CAD with patent grafts may lead to ongoing chest pain and potential myocardial infarction.
2. Anemia: The patient's low Hct level puts him at risk for tissue hypoxia and inadequate oxygen delivery to organs.
3. Infection: The patient's recurring fevers and negative cultures suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could be bacterial or fungal."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who has undergone three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He is not a surgical candidate according to CT surgery. The patient's current condition includes chest pain, fever, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. He is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments including nitroglycerin, aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and pain management with oxycodone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have fluctuated, indicating a potential risk of acute renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 20.0, indicating anemia. Iron studies show iron deficiency. It is essential to address this issue promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Chest Pain: The patient continues to experience chest pain, which may be indicative of ongoing ischemic heart disease or angina. EKG monitoring and appropriate pain management are necessary.
4. Fever: The patient had recurring fevers initially, but has since been afebrile. Monitoring for any signs of infection or recurrence of fever is essential, especially considering the presence of an indwelling arterial line previously.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's hemoglobin A1c level is 8.0, indicating uncontrolled diabetes. Glycemic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain. He continues to be drowsy and has had several large bowel movements with a positive guaiac test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is receiving 1 L of normal saline (NS) due to his urine sodium fractional excretion being less than 1%, suggesting renal dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) three times. He is currently in the ICU due to ongoing chest pain and has been experiencing fevers, anemia, acute renal failure, and hyperglycemia. The patient is a Jehovah's Witness and refuses blood products. His current vital signs include a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 166/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of severe CAD and previous CABG surgeries. He is scheduled for cardiac catheterization today. There is a risk of further cardiac complications such as angina, myocardial infarction, or arrhythmias.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct is down to 20.0, indicating significant anemia. Refusal of blood products due to religious beliefs may exacerbate this condition, leading to worsening tissue oxygenation and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, suggesting renal dysfunction. Continued monitoring and management of fluid status, electrolytes, and renal function are essential to prevent further deterioration.
4. Fever: The patient has had recurring fevers"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease who has undergone triple coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient is not considered a surgical candidate by cardiac surgery. The patient's chief complaint is chest pain, and he has been experiencing fever, anemia, acute renal failure, and other medical complications.

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has severe coronary artery disease with one patent graft. Cardiac catheterization is planned for today.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has dropped from 27.8% to 20.0%. Guaiac positive results indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. Iron studies confirm iron deficiency anemia. The patient's Hct goal is 30, but he is refusing packed red blood cell transfusion due to religious beliefs (Jehovah's Witness). Treatment includes epoetin alfa 4000 units subcutaneously on Tu/Th/Sat, iron supplementation, and monitoring of complete blood count.

3. Fever: The patient had recurring fevers on January 1st. Blood cultures, urine cultures, and urinalysis were negative. An abdominal CT scan showed wall thickening in the cecum and ascending colon. The patient has been afebrile since January 3rd. Antibiotic therapy with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, and metronidazole is ongoing.

4. Acute renal failure: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease and history of three coronary artery bypass grafts. He was admitted to the ICU with chest pain and was found to have anemia with a hemoglobin level of 19.5%. The patient is refusing packed red blood cells due to religious beliefs. He underwent cardiac catheterization but no intervention was performed. The patient's fever has improved since starting antibiotics for suspected infection. His renal function is normal, and his ejection fraction on echocardiogram is 55%. He has a history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is significantly low, indicating anemia. Refusal of packed red blood cells may worsen his condition and lead to further complications such as heart failure or inadequate oxygenation.
2. Infection: Although the patient's fever has improved with antibiotics, there is still a possibility of ongoing infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly is crucial.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level was elevated but has returned to normal after receiving intravenous fluids. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to detect any deterioration.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of severe coronary artery disease and previous bypass surgeries. His ejection fraction is within normal limits, but ongoing monitoring for signs of heart failure or ischemic events is essential.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old well-nourished man who is currently in the ICU. He has been admitted for a cardiac issue and has been receiving various treatments and medications. The patient's vital signs are generally stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/61 mmHg to 105/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds without murmurs, and his peripheral vascular examination shows normal pulses in both upper and lower extremities. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, and has normoactive bowel sounds. Neurologically, the patient is grossly intact and alert.

The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, sodium, potassium, and glucose. However, the patient has elevated levels of creatinine and troponin T. Other lab results, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Cardiac complications: The patient's initial admission was for a cardiac issue, and there is mention of tight coronary lesions. Therefore, there is a possibility of ongoing cardiac problems, such as myocardial ischemia or infarction.

2. Infection: The patient has been receiving antibiotics, suggesting the presence of an infection. It is important to monitor for signs of sepsis or worsening infection.

3. Bleeding: The patient has received blood products, indicating a risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of clotting parameters and signs of bleeding is necessary.

4. Kidney dysfunction: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest potential kidney dysfunction. Monitoring kidney function and ensuring appropriate fluid management is crucial.

5. Respiratory issues: The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen, which indicates possible respiratory difficulties. Monitoring oxygenation and respiratory status is essential.

6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis, suggesting a risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation is important.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable at the moment, but careful monitoring and management of these potential complications are necessary to ensure optimal care."

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with chest pain. He underwent cardiac catheterization but no interventions were performed. The patient has been experiencing mild chest pain and is currently on medical management with medications such as metoprolol, ranolazine, and imdur.

The patient has anemia with a hematocrit level of 19.5% (from 27.8%), and iron studies confirm iron deficiency. He is refusing packed red blood cells due to religious beliefs (Jehovah's Witness). Epoetin alfa and iron supplementation are being given to manage the anemia.

The patient had fevers initially, for which he was started on vancomycin. Blood cultures from different dates showed no growth, and urine cultures were also negative. The abdominal CT scan showed wall thickening in the cecum and ascending colon, but since starting antibiotics, the patient's pain and fever have improved. He is now afebrile.

The patient has acute renal failure with a previous creatinine level of 1.3, but it has improved after receiving 1 liter of intravenous fluid. Trending of creatinine levels will continue.

The patient's ejection fraction on echocardiogram is 55%, and he appears euvolemic without evidence of heart failure. Beta-blockers and captopril are being continued.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: to home, when O2 weaned & fever resolves
","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe coronary artery disease, who has undergone three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He is currently in the ICU for chest pain and is experiencing mild chest pain this morning. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), a heart rate of 67 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 134/61 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. His general appearance is well-nourished, lying in bed, and alert and oriented to time, place, and person. 

The cardiovascular examination reveals normal heart sounds with no murmurs, clear lung sounds anteriorly, and peripheral pulses are present bilaterally in both upper and lower extremities. The abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender, non-distended abdomen with normoactive bowel sounds. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 19.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17000/uL, elevated troponin T levels, elevated glucose levels, and altered liver function tests. The creatinine level has improved from 1.3 to 1.0 mg/dL after receiving intravenous fluids. 

The patient's medications include metoprolol, ranolazine, imdur, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, epo, iron supplements, high-dose statin, aspirin, and other medications as mentioned in the progress note. 

The patient's plan of care includes continuing epo, iron supplementation, and holding heparin due to the drop in hemoglobin levels. He will also continue to receive fluid resuscitation as needed, and his blood cultures will be trended. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening chest pain, further drop in hemoglobin levels leading to severe anemia, potential infection due to indwelling lines, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrhythmias."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with severe coronary artery disease, who has undergone three coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG). He is currently admitted to the ICU for cardiac catheterization, but no intervention was performed due to tight lesions. The patient continues to refuse packed red blood cells (pRBC) due to religious beliefs. His current medications include Ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, Ranolazine, Imdur, and Metoprolol. He is also on high-dose statin therapy, aspirin, and epoetin alfa for anemia. The patient's Hct has dropped to 19.5% from 27.8%, and iron studies indicate iron deficiency. He has a history of fever, which was initially treated with IV vancomycin, but blood cultures have been negative. The patient has acute renal failure, which improved with IV fluid resuscitation. His ejection fraction (EF) is 55%, and he is in sinus rhythm but has multiple premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). He also has diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic pain. The patient's pain regimen has been adjusted due to oversedation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine level has improved after receiving IV fluids, but ongoing monitoring is required to prevent further deterioration.
2. Anemia: The patient's Hct has significantly decreased to "
