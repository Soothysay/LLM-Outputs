   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient received blood products and fresh frozen plasma, indicating a possible bleeding disorder or coagulopathy. The vital signs are relatively stable with normal temperature, blood pressure within the normal range, respiratory rate within the expected range, and oxygen saturation at 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, and other unspecified problems. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels increasing over time, slightly elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient is on various medications including octreotide, pantoprazole, furosemide, and possibly antibiotics. The physical examination findings are incomplete, as several assessments were not performed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the gastrointestinal bleed, exacerbation of heart failure, development of further arrhythmias, worsening coagulopathy leading to increased bleeding risk, and potential infections due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, coagulation profile, and liver function tests. Frequent reassessment of the patient's bleeding status and cardiac function should be conducted. The need for anticoagulation therapy should be carefully evaluated considering the patient's coagulopathy. Close monitoring for any signs of infection or"

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with PMHx of Severe COPD, Diastolic Dysfunction and AVJ
   ablation s/p PCM who presents with BRBPP, Hct of 13 and
   supratherapeutic INR at 21.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presenting with 3-4 days of dark stools and BRBPR.
   Found to have hct drop to 13 and still HD stable which suggests that
   this must have been slow bleed with compensation.  Unclear source, may
   be bleeding from more than one site. Given gross coagulopathy with INR
   of 21, unsafe for NG tube or urgent EGD per GI.  Will aggressively
   resuscitate with blood & FFP overnight, t/b with GI if any signs of
   recurrent melena.
   - received 5 units PRBCs and 3 units FFP with only modest increase in
   HCT
   - maintain > 4units crossmatched
   - f/u q4hr hct
   - Cipro 400mg IV BID for PPx (possible UGI source)
   - NPO with protonix gtt at 8mg/hr
   - octreotide 50mcg bolus and gtt at 50mcg/hr
   - f/u GI recs
   - correct coagulopathy as below
   - maintain PIV & CVL
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Pt on coumadin as outpt and last INR was 1.8 on [**2-28**]^th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day
   and now found to have INR>21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course
   of Abx in early [**Month (only) **] for H. Pylori and he was recently treated with
   Prednisone for gout flare.  Otherwise, no recent med changes, does
   report poor po intake.  Pt denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria and
   hemoptysis.  Received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u FFP prior to transfer
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg po x 3days
   - FFP PRN
   - f/u INR
   .
   # Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN seen
   on RUQ u/s performed in [**10-19**].  Pt is unaware of this diagnosis and does
   not appear to have had any workup in the past.  EGD from 07 did not
   show any varices, but may have developed portal gastropathy in the
   interim.
   - f/u iron studies
   - f/u hepatitis panel, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], [**Last Name (un) 5861**], AMA
   - f/u liver consult recs
   .
   # Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt with known diastolic dysfunction presenting
   with significant hct drop and GI bleed, now being aggressively
   resuscitated with blood products.  Concern for volume overload/pulm
   edema with resuscitation
   - lasix 40mg IV with every 2-3units of products
   - holding BP meds given marginal BPs and hypovolemia
   - monitor resp status, CPAP overnight
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine of approx 1.8 and now 2.3 with BUN of 80.
   Pt is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.  Elevated
   BUN may also be due to upper GI bleed.  Will aggressively resuscitate
   with blood products and recheck lytes in am.
   - transfuse as above
   - monitor lytes [**Hospital1 **]
   - foley in place
   - f/u am labs and send urine lytes if not improving
   .
   # Afib s/p AVJ ablation & PCM: holding coumadin given INR>21 and active
   GI bleed
   - hold nodal agents given hypovolemia and bleed

- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and atrioventricular junction ablation.
- He presents with bloody rice bran porridge per rectum (BRBPP) and a hematocrit of 13, indicating a slow gastrointestinal bleed that has been compensated.
- The patient has an elevated INR of 21, suggesting a coagulopathy.
- He has received 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 3 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with only a modest increase in hematocrit.
- The source of the gastrointestinal bleed is unclear, but there is a suspicion of bleeding from multiple sites.
- The patient is being aggressively resuscitated with blood products and is being monitored closely for signs of recurrent melena.
- Ciprofloxacin is being given as prophylaxis for possible upper gastrointestinal source.
- The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) with pantoprazole (Protonix) at 8 mg/hr and octreotide at 50 mcg/hr.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and atrioventricular junction ablation status post pulmonary embolism and coronary artery disease. He presented with brown-red blood per rectal (BRBPR), hemoglobin drop to 13, and supratherapeutic INR at 21. The patient has been experiencing dark stools for the past 3-4 days.

The endoscopy showed clean-based ulceration and erosive gastritis without an active source of bleeding. The patient may also have concurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). His hemoglobin level remains stable, and he has received 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) so far.

The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to his use of Coumadin, with an elevated INR of 21. He has been on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5 mg per day and was previously on an INR of 1.8 on February 28th.

   supratherapeutic INR at 21.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presenting with 3-4 days of dark stools and BRBPR.
   Found to have hct drop to 13 and still HD stable which suggests that
   this must have been slow bleed with compensation.  EGD [**3-28**] showed
   cleaned based ulceration and erosive gastritis with no active source of
   bleeding.  Given inappopriate response to blood products pt may also
   have concurrent LGIB.

   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Pt on coumadin as outpt and last INR was 1.8 on [**2-28**]^th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day
   and now found to have INR>21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course
   of Abx in early [**Month (only) **] for H. Pylori and he was recently treated with
   Prednisone for gout flare.  Otherwise, no recent med changes, does
   report poor po intake.  Pt denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria and
   hemoptysis.  Received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u FFP prior to transfer
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg po x 3days

   # Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN seen
   on RUQ u/s performed in [**10-19**].  Pt is unaware of this diagnosis and does
   not appear to have had any workup in the past.  EGD did not show any

   # Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt with known diastolic dysfunction presenting
   with significant hct drop and GI bleed, now being aggressively
   resuscitated with blood products.  Concern for volume overload/pulm
   edema with resuscitation
   - holding BP meds given marginal BPs and hypovolemia, would not be
   aggressive with diuresis given GI bleed and ARF
   - monitor resp status, CPAP overnight
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine of approx 1.8 and now 2.3 with BUN of 80.
   Pt is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.    Continue
   to resuscitate with blood products PRN, encourage Pos (clears) and IVF

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation status post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCM). He presents with a three-day history of dark stools and bloody brown-red bowel movement (BRBPR), resulting in a hemoglobin drop to 13. Endoscopy showed cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis without an active source of bleeding. The patient has been receiving pantoprazole and is being followed up by the GI team. He has received 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 5 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), with stable hemoglobin levels. The patient's coagulopathy is being monitored, and he is receiving vitamin K and FFP as needed. He has a history of cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension, but no varices were seen on endoscopy. The patient's diastolic dysfunction is also noted, along with acute renal failure (ARF), atrial fibrillation after AVJ ablation and PCM, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and fever/neutropenia (FEN). Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots, supratherapeutic INR, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The patient's code status is full code, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor if his hemoglobin levels remain"

   # GI Bleed: Pt presenting with 3-4 days of dark stools and BRBPR.
   Found to have hct drop to 13 and still HD stable which suggests that
   this must have been slow bleed with compensation.  EGD [**3-28**] showed
   cleaned based ulceration and erosive gastritis with no active source of
   bleeding.

   # Coagulopathy:  Pt on coumadin as outpt and last INR was 1.8 on [**2-28**]^th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day
   and now found to have INR>21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course
   of Abx in early [**Month (only) **] for H. Pylori and he was recently treated with
   Prednisone for gout flare.  Otherwise, no recent med changes, does
   report poor po intake.  Pt denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria and
   hemoptysis.  Received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u FFP prior to transfer
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg po x 3days
   - FFP PRN
   - f/u INR

   # Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN seen
   on RUQ u/s performed in [**10-19**].  Pt is unaware of this diagnosis and does
   not appear to have had any workup in the past.  EGD from 07 did not
   show any varices, but may have developed portal gastropathy in the
   interim.

   with significant hct drop and GI bleed, now being aggressively
   resuscitated with blood products.  Concern for volume overload/pulm
   edema with resuscitation
   - holding BP meds given marginal BPs and hypovolemia
   - monitor resp status, CPAP overnight
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine of approx 1.8 and now 2.3 with BUN of 80.
   Pt is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.  Elevated
   BUN may also be due to upper GI bleed.  Will aggressively resuscitate
   with blood products and recheck lytes in am.

","The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation status post percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient presented with bloody rice Krispy-like stools and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, suggesting a slow gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed clean-based ulceration and erosive gastritis without an active source of bleeding.

The patient's coagulation profile is abnormal, with an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) of 21, likely due to his use of Coumadin and recent treatment with prednisone. He received Vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) prior to transfer.

The patient has cirrhosis with ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension, as seen on a recent ultrasound. However, an EGD performed in July did not show any varices but may have developed portal gastropathy in the interim.

The patient's diastolic dysfunction and recent significant drop in hemoglobin concentration raise concerns for volume overload and pulmonary edema with resuscitation. His blood pressure medications are being held, and he is on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) overnight.

The patient's baseline creatinine level is approximately 1.8, and now it is 2.3 with a BUN of 80. He is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation who presented with BRBPR, Hct of 13, and supratherapeutic INR at 21. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including GI bleed, coagulopathy, cirrhosis, diastolic dysfunction, ARF, atrial fibrillation post AVJ ablation and PCM, OSA, and FEN. The patient is currently being managed in the ICU with aggressive resuscitation, monitoring of vital signs, coagulopathy, and electrolyte levels. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of dark stools and BRBPR, indicating a potential GI bleed. EGD showed cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis with no active source of bleeding. However, the patient may still be at risk for further bleeding or re-bleeding.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is elevated at 21, which is significantly higher than the therapeutic range. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications. The patient is receiving Vitamin K and FFP to correct the coagulopathy.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has been diagnosed with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN. This can lead to complications such as variceal bleeding"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation status post-pericardial contusion. He presents with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, characterized by dark stools and bloody rectal bleeding, which has led to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) from 25 to 13.

The patient has been treated with blood products but has shown an inappropriate response, suggesting a possible concurrent lower GI bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed on 3/28 showed cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis without an active source of bleeding.

The patient's coagulopathy is concerning as his international normalized ratio (INR) was found to be >21, significantly higher than his usual range of 1-2. He is on warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation post AVJ ablation and pericardial contusion. Recent changes in medication include completing a course of antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori infection and receiving prednisone for a gout flare. The patient reports poor oral intake.

The patient also has cirrhosis with ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension, as indicated by a recent abdominal ultrasound. However, an EGD did not reveal any varices.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleed, acute diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, and others. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions in the ICU.

24-hour events include the placement of two peripheral IV lines, femoral line placement, sitting up in a chair and feeling better, transition from face tent to nasal cannula, stable hematocrit levels, and preparation for possible cardiac catheterization in the ICU tomorrow. If the procedure is not clear, the patient may be transferred to the floor for cardiac catheterization on the east wing.

The patient has allergies to Ancef (Cefazolin Sodium) and has received a last dose of antibiotics, Ciprofloxacin, at 10:50 PM. The patient is currently receiving multiple ICU medications and other medications.

Vital signs and flow sheet data show stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, blood pressure within normal range with some fluctuations, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 96% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring indicates AV paced rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,221 mL and total output of 2,430 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -209 mL.

Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with an ABG"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coagulopathy, obstructive sleep apnea, and allergies to Ancef. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/71 to 165/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert, oriented, and pale but not in acute distress. Physical examination reveals sclera anicteric, moist mucous membranes, supple neck, clear lungs, regular heart rhythm with a grade 2 systolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border, soft abdomen with decreased bowel sounds, and chronic severe lower extremity edema with venous stasis changes. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and is currently on various ICU medications. The patient is being prepared for a possible cardiac scope in the ICU tomorrow, and if the results are not clear, they will be transferred to the floor for further evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   64 y/o M with PMHx of Severe COPD, Diastolic Dysfunction and AVJ
   ablation s/p PCM who presents with BRBPR, Hct of 13 and
   supratherapeutic INR at 21.
   .
   # GI Bleed: Pt presenting with 3-4 days of dark stools and BRBPR.
   Found to have hct drop to 13 and still HD stable which suggests that
   this must have been slow bleed with compensation.  EGD [**3-28**] showed
   cleaned based ulceration and erosive gastritis with no active source of
   bleeding.  Given inappopriate response to blood products pt may also
   have concurrent LGIB.
   - HCT stable, f/u TID HCT
   - prepped overnight, likely c-scope by GI tomorrow
   - protonix gtt at 8mg/hr
   - f/u GI recs
   - monitor coagulopathy
   - maintain PIV & CVL , active type and screen
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Pt on coumadin as outpt and last INR was 1.8 on [**2-28**]^th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day
   and now found to have INR>21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course
   of Abx in early [**Month (only) **] for H. Pylori and he was recently treated with
   Prednisone for gout flare.  Otherwise, no recent med changes, does
   report poor po intake.  Pt denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria and
   hemoptysis.  Received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u FFP prior to transfer.
   - continue Vitamin K 5mg po x 3days
   - FFP PRN
   - f/u INR

   # Cirrhosis: Pt with cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly & portal HTN seen
   on RUQ u/s performed in [**10-19**].  Pt is unaware of this diagnosis and does
   not appear to have had any workup in the past.  EGD did not show any
   varices.
   - f/u hepatitis panel, [**Doctor First Name 1205**], [**Last Name (un) 5861**], AMA

   # Diastolic Dysfunction: Pt with known diastolic dysfunction presenting
   with significant hct drop and GI bleed, now being aggressively
   resuscitated with blood products.  Concern for volume overload/pulm
   edema with resuscitation
   - holding BP meds given marginal BPs and hypovolemia, would not be
   aggressive with diuresis given GI bleed and ARF
   - monitor resp status, CPAP overnight
   .
   # ARF: Baseline creatinine of approx 1.8 and now 2.3 with BUN of 80.
   Pt is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.    Continue
   to resuscitate with blood products PRN, encourage POs (clears) and IVF
   boluses PRN.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation status post percutaneous coronary intervention (PCM). The patient presents with dark stools, a low hemoglobin concentration (Hct) of 13, and a supratherapeutic INR of 21. 

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has been experiencing dark stools for the past 3-4 days, along with a significant drop in Hct to 13. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis without an active source of bleeding. This suggests a slow bleed that has been compensated. The patient may also have concurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).

2. Coagulopathy: The patient was on Coumadin as an outpatient, but his last INR was 1.8 on February 28th. He has been maintained on a stable regimen of 1 or 1.5mg per day of Coumadin. However, he now has an INR >21 for unclear reasons. He completed a course of antibiotics for Helicobacter pylori infection and was recently treated with Prednisone for a gout flare. The patient denies mucosal bleeding, hematuria, and hemoptysis. He received Vitamin K 10mg IV and 1u Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) prior to transfer.

3. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension seen on a recent right upper quadrant ultrasound performed on October 19th. The patient is unaware of this diagnosis and has not had any workup in the past. EGD did not show any varices.

4. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient has known diastolic dysfunction and is presenting with a significant drop in Hct and GI bleed, being aggressively resuscitated with blood products. There is concern for volume overload/pulmonary edema with resuscitation.

5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine is approximately 1.8, and it has increased to 2.3 with a BUN of 80. The patient is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss. Continue aggressive resuscitation with blood products as needed, encourage oral intake (clear fluids), and intravenous fluid boluses as needed.

6. Atrial Fibrillation (Afib) status post AVJ ablation & PCM: Coumadin is being held due to an INR >21 and active GI bleed. Nodal agents are also being held due to hypovolemia and bleed.

7. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has OSA, restrictive pulmonary function tests, and severe pulmonary hypertension. CP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old male with a medical history of severe COPD, diastolic dysfunction, and AVJ ablation status post pulmonary embolism.
- The patient presented with bloody brown rice-like stools (BRBPR), a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) to 13, and a supratherapeutic INR of 21.
- Endoscopy showed cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis but no active source of bleeding. The patient may also have concurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB).
- The patient is on warfarin and has been maintained on a stable regimen, but the high INR is unclear. He completed a course of antibiotics for H. pylori and was recently treated with prednisone for gout flare. He also reports poor oral intake.
- The patient has cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension. An abdominal ultrasound was performed, but esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not show any varices.
- The patient has known diastolic dysfunction and is presenting with significant Hct drop and GI bleed, being aggressively resuscitated with blood products. There is concern for volume overload/pulmonary edema with resuscitation.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) with baseline creatinine of approximately 1.8 and now 2.3, along with a BUN of 80. He is likely pre-renal due to hypovolemia from blood loss.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation post AVJ ablation and pulmonary embolism. Coumadin is being held due to an elevated INR and active GI bleed.
- The patient has obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), restrictive pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and severe pulmonary hypertension.
- The patient's femoral line will be discontinued, and further peripheral intravenous (PIV) access will be obtained.
- Code status is full code, and the patient will be transferred to the floor if the Hct remains stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient presented with BRBPR, a significant drop in Hct, and evidence of cleaned-based ulceration and erosive gastritis on EGD. There is a possibility of ongoing or recurrent GI bleeding, which could lead to further hypovolemia and complications.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is supratherapeutic (>21), indicating a high risk of bleeding. The patient is on warfarin, and recent antibiotic use and prednisone treatment may have contributed to the elevated INR. Monitoring coagulopathy and adjusting anticoagulant therapy will be crucial to prevent further bleeding complications.
3. Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension: The patient has cirrhosis, ascites, splenomegaly, and portal hypertension. These conditions increase the risk"
