","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with significant medical history including atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and pontine and cerebellar infarcts. The patient was transferred from the floor due to worsening fevers and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). The patient has persistent fevers despite negative cultures and is currently being treated for central fever. The patient's recent RVR episode is likely related to high fevers.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Fevers: Most likely central fevers given cultures have remained negative for several weeks and has not been septic at all.
   - sputum cultures
   - Vanc/meropenem pending sputum and blood culture results.

2. Atrial Fibrillation - Recent RVR episode likely related to high fevers.
   - APAP/ibuprofen/cooling blanket for fever control
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mt PO TID, uptitrate as needed
   - heparin to coumadin bridge; will continue heparin tooth oozing has resolved.
   - continue to monitor INR daily, increased coumadin to 10 mg daily (on [**1-1**]) as subtheraputic on 7.5 (from [**12-29**]).

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II - On tube feeds.
   - continue NPH 30 units [**Hospital1 7**], HISS
   - QID accucheck

4. Recent Pontine and Cerebellar Strokes - No active issues. Pt opens eyes to verbal stimuli and can follow simple commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Central fever: The patient has persistent fevers despite negative cultures, indicating a possible central fever. Further investigation is required to identify the underlying cause.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's recent RVR episode may be related to high fevers. Monitoring of heart rhythm and appropriate medication adjustment will be necessary to manage this condition.

3. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient is on tube feeds and requires careful glycemic control. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and adjustment of insulin dosage may be necessary to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.

4. Recent Pontine and Cerebellar Strokes: The patient's neurological status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration. Physical therapy and rehabilitation planning should be considered for optimal recovery.

Please note that the potential medical complications mentioned above are based"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and pontine and cerebellar infarcts. He was admitted to the ICU for persistent fevers and worsening atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been experiencing central fevers, possibly related to an empyema or lower extremity clot. His hypotension is likely due to insensible losses from fevers, and he responds well to small amounts of fluids without antibiotics. The patient also has hyponatremia and a history of diabetes mellitus type II, which is well-controlled on tube feeds. He has had recent pontine and cerebellar strokes but is currently without active issues. The patient is receiving various ICU care measures, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and he is being screened for rehabilitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Empyema: Given the small effusion on the chest X-ray, there is a possibility of empyema, which can cause central fevers and potential respiratory complications.
2. Lower Extremity Clot: Considering the presence of 4+ pitting edema in the right lower extremity, there is a possibility of a lower extremity clot"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of pontine and cerebellar cerebrovascular accident (CVA), currently admitted to the ICU with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (afib RVR). The patient has mild hypotension and is running a persistent fever, likely central in origin due to the pontine lesion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.9°C (102.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/78 to 82/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm remains in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 7.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 30.5%, platelet count (Plt) of 272 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, and glucose level of 108 mg/dL. The coagulation profile reveals an INR of 1.7, PT of 19.0 seconds, and PTT of 82.1 seconds. Other electrolyte levels are within normal range.

Plan:
1. Fever: Extensive work-up without ongoing source. At this time, appears central in setting of pontine lesion without clear source.

 TACHYCARDIA, OTHER
   50 y/o M with PMHx significant for atrial fibrillation, CAD, HTN, CHF,
   DM, obesity, and pontine and cerebellar infarcts, persistant fevers,
   s/p toot extraction transferred from floor for worsening fevers and
   AFib with RVR.
   # Fevers: Most likely central fevers given cultures have remained
   negative for several weeks and has not been septic at all. Would
   consider possible empyema given small effusion on CXR. LENIS and
   bedside ultrasound of chest negative. Per neurology, no good treatment
   for central fevers besides a cooling blanket. No fever in close to 24
   hours.
   -Follow up cultures
   -Cooling blanket PRN
   #Hypotension: Likely he is only volume down from insensible losses from
   his fevers as he has no elevated WBC or lactate and he responds quickly
   to small amounts of fluids without antibiotics.
   - IVF as needed.
   #Hyponatremia: Urine lytes consistent with appropriate ADH release. Now
   resolved
   -Con
t to monitor
   .
   #Conjunctivitis: Continue erythromycin ointment x 5 days total
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation - Recent RVR episode likely related to high
   fevers. Well controlled overnight, consider baclofen for central
   fevers.
   - APAP/ibuprofen/cooling blanket for fever control
   - continue metoprolol tartrate 25 mt PO TID, uptitrate as needed
   - heparin to coumadin bridge; coumadin at increased dose 10mg daily
   while subtherapeutic..
   - continue to monitor INR daily, increased coumadin to 10 mg daily (on

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and pontine and cerebellar infarcts. The patient presented with persistent fevers, which have not been accompanied by any positive cultures, indicating that the fevers are likely central in origin. The patient also has hypotension, but it is not due to septic shock as the patient responds well to fluid resuscitation. The patient's hyponatremia has resolved, and he is being monitored closely for any changes.

The patient is currently on various medications including metoprolol tartrate, heparin, and baclofen for fever control. The patient's diabetes mellitus type II is well controlled, and he is on tube feeds. The patient's recent pontine and cerebellar strokes do not appear to be active issues as he can open his eyes to verbal stimuli and follow simple commands.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Central fever: The patient's persistent fevers despite negative cultures suggest a central fever, which can be caused by conditions such as empyema or meningitis. Further investigations such as imaging studies may be necessary to identify the underlying cause.

2. Hypotension: Although the patient's hypotension is currently managed with fluids, it is important to monitor for any signs of worsening or development of shock. Appropriate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of cerebellar/pontine stroke who has been experiencing persistent fevers despite an extensive work-up. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for atrial fibrillation with metoprolol and heparin bridging to coumadin. The patient's mental status is stable, and they are on a nutrition plan with Boost Glucose Control. The patient has a history of poor dentition, right-sided lower extremity edema, and is overweight/obese. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/74 mmHg to 165/135 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a tracheal mask.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Process: Despite extensive evaluation, there is no evidence of an infectious process causing the fevers. However, it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and consider further investigations if necessary.
2. Venous Thromboembolism (VTE): The patient has been on systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). It is crucial to monitor the patient's coagulation parameters and ensure proper anticoagulation therapy.
3. Glycemic Control"
