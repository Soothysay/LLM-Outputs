","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation (now off coumadin), and recent presentation with melena and a drop in hematocrit (HCT). The patient has been diagnosed with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an endoscopy today, which identified the source of bleeding as a duodenal vessel. The patient received epinephrine and endoclips to control the bleeding. The patient's HCT is currently at 23, and another unit of blood has been ordered. The patient is also being transfused with pantoprazole (Protonix) via infusion. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/43 to 150/56 mmHg, heart rate of 63 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 2,710 mL and a total output of 3,020 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 310 mL. The patient's urine output is 3,020 mL, indicating adequate hydration. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the head and neck, cardiovascular system, or extremities. The patient's mental status is appropriate, and neurological examination"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a recent history of stroke and atrial fibrillation, presenting with melena and a drop in hematocrit (HCT). He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which identified the source of bleeding as a duodenal vessel that was treated with epinephrine injection and endoclips. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday morning, and an additional 2 units this morning due to a lack of response to earlier transfusions. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/43 mmHg to 115/28 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen. The patient's physical examination shows no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus, but there are melenic bowel movements. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has an ongoing risk of gastrointestinal bleeding due to the identified duodenal vessel bleed. Monitoring hemoglobin and hematocrit levels is essential to assess for any further blood loss. Continued administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will help reduce gastric acid secretion and minimize further bleeding risk.
2. Atrial Fibrillation ("

 ALTERATION IN NUTRITION:  To have PICC line placed for TPN.
 GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED, OTHER (GI BLEED, GIB):  EGD yesterday with
   bleeding vessel in duodenal bulb s/p clipping.  Gi feels this would not
   be amenable to repeat GI intervention given difficult location and
   recommends IR intervention if he continues to bleed. IR team aware.
   Still concerned that he may be bleeding albeit less briskly. Continue
   to monitor in the ICU.
 ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA:   Completing course of levo/flagyl for
   aspiration pneumonia.
 MINIMAL HEMOPTYSIS:  Likely secondary to trauma in setting of nasal
   suctioning overnight.  Minimize trauma, follow clinically at this
   point, repeat CXR.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have been admitted to the ICU and have undergone various procedures and interventions. The patient's chief complaint is gastrointestinal bleeding, which was identified during an endoscopy that revealed a bleeding arterial vessel in the duodenal bulb. The bleeding was successfully controlled by placing clips on the vessel. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight and has a current hemoglobin concentration of 26.5%.

The patient also has a history of aspiration pneumonia, for which they are receiving antibiotics, and minimal hemoptysis, which is believed to be secondary to trauma from nasal suctioning. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they are experiencing fatigue, cough, and weakness. They have a history of anemia, atrial fibrillation, and right lower extremity edema. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and slightly abnormal electrolyte levels. They are currently receiving multiple medications including proton pump inhibitors, diuretics, sedatives, and analgesics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding from the duodenal bulb: Since the source of bleeding was successfully controlled but not completely eliminated, there is a risk of re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, and there is always a risk of developing additional infections, especially in the ICU setting.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal bleeding. He presents with melena and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration due to the duodenal bleed. The patient has been managed with NPO (nothing by mouth), pantoprazole (protonix) IV bid, and transfusions for hemoglobin goal of 26 or evidence of active bleed. He also has a history of COPD and is being treated with nebulizers. The patient has leukocytosis with a rising white blood cell count to 20.2, and the differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonia, Clostridium difficile infection, and recurrent GI bleeding. Given the patient's history of aspiration and increased secretions, a pulmonary source is likely. He has completed a course of levofloxacin and metronidazole, and will now start cefepime, vancomycin, and flagyl. A stool culture has been checked for C. difficile. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for an irregular heart rhythm and a systolic murmur at the left sternal border. Physical examination findings include diffuse rhonchi that clear with coughing, no abdominal abnormalities, and normal neurologic examination. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and elevated potassium levels. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he has been called out to the floor. Potential complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's cardiovascular status due to atrial fibrillation, worsening of the duodenal bleed leading to hypovolemic shock, development of pneumonia or other infections due to aspiration and compromised immune system, and potential complications related to the use of multiple medications and central lines."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old male with a recent history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal bleeding. The patient presents with melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) due to a duodenal bleed. The patient has been treated with pantoprazole (Protonix) and transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The goal is to maintain a hematocrit (Hct) above 30.

The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is off coumadin. The heart rate has been in the 50s-60s. Digoxin is being continued, and a digoxin level is being checked. Metoprolol has been held due to possible medication effect on heart rate.

The patient also has leukocytosis with a rising white blood cell count, likely of pulmonary origin. Cultures are pending, and antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) are being continued.

The patient has a history of COPD and is being treated with nebulizer therapy. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) due to GI bleeding and is receiving nutrition through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) via a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include further bleeding from the duodenal ulcer, worsening of atrial fibrillation, respiratory infections due to COPD, and complications related to prolonged bed rest and immobility such as pressure ulcers and deep vein thrombosis. Close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is essential to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and recent duodenal bleeding. He presents with melena and a decreased hematocrit level. The patient has been placed on a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) order and is currently receiving treatment for duodenal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, and potential pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Duodenal Bleeding: The patient has a known GI bleed in the duodenal bulb, which was treated with endoscopic clipping. There is a risk of rebleeding or ongoing bleeding leading to further drop in hematocrit levels.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and an increased risk of clot formation. This increases the risk of stroke or systemic embolism.
3. Pulmonary Aspiration: The patient's history of COPD and increased secretions suggests a high risk of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and infection.
4. Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI): The patient has been treated with antibiotics, which increases the risk of developing CDI. Symptoms may include diarrhea and abdominal pain.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings are being used"

The patient is a critically ill male with a chief complaint of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) three days ago and is still experiencing melena, indicating ongoing blood loss. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is falling, and they have received additional blood transfusions. The resident's note agrees with the assessment and plan provided above.

24-hour events include blood cultures being drawn twice, urine culture being drawn once, and stool culture being drawn once. Allergies are not reported, and the last dose of antibiotics was given on [2162-11-11] at 05:49 PM.

The patient is currently receiving multiple IV medications, including cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, and pantoprazole. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the ongoing melena. Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are awake and alert with no distress. HEENT, neck, and abdomen are unremarkable, while lung bases have decreased breath sounds with crackles. Extremities show no edema.

Laboratory values indicate anemia with a Hct of 24.0% and a WBC count of 300 K/uL. Blood cultures were positive for beta-streptococcus. Other labs show"

","The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of melena and falling hemoglobin (Hct) levels. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) three days ago and has continued to have melena. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is climbing, so empirical antibiotic therapy was initiated. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was also started.

The patient's 24-hour events include blood cultures being drawn at 11:11 AM and 12:32 PM, urine culture at 11:11 AM, and stool culture at 11:11 AM. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including levofloxacin, cefepime, vancomycin, metronidazole, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications. The last dose of antibiotics was given at different times.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of melena. The patient's physical examination is notable for decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles, but the abdomen and extremities are unremarkable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 59 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 123/45 to 149/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

The patient's labs show a hemoglobin level of 9.6 g/dL, WBC count of 300 K/uL, platelet count of 224, creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 107 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride level of 25 mEq/L, and magnesium level of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken at different times. The patient's physical examination findings include awake and alert with no distress, unremarkable head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), supple neck, decreased breath sounds at the bases with crackles, benign abdomen, and no extremity edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include duodenal ulcer, upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and blood loss anemia. The patient is to continue transfusion and follow Hct levels and melena, as well as receive vitamin K for a borderline international normalized ratio (INR). The patient is also to continue proton pump inhibitor (PPI), IV access is adequate, leukocytosis is to be repeated, and chest X-ray is to be repeated. Empirical antibiotic therapy is to continue, and digoxin therapy is to be continued due to atrial fibrillation.

The patient's nutrition is being provided through TPN with lipids at 66 mL/hour. The patient has two IV lines, an 18-gauge line and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer disease is being provided. The patient's ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions include using an oral airway and providing supplemental oxygen as needed.

The patient has a code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI) and is dispositioned to the ICU. The total time spent with the patient is 35 minutes."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of duodenal ulcer, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and blood loss anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125-154/37-41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and other ICU medications. His lab results show some abnormalities such as leukocytosis, elevated white blood cell count, and borderline INR. Imaging studies reveal small effusions and reticular infiltrates on chest X-ray.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Infection: The presence of leukocytosis and positive cultures for staph in sputum suggest a possible infection. The patient is already receiving vancomycin for this issue.

2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient has a history of aspiration, and the CXR shows reticular infiltrates, which may indicate aspiration pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics and supportive care should be continued.

3. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as DVT prophylaxis should be considered.

","The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and recent duodenal bleed presenting with melena and a decreased hematocrit level. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient has received various treatments and interventions. He has been given red blood cell transfusions, antibiotics, and medications such as furosemide, pantoprazole, and digoxin.

The patient's vital signs have been stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate in the 50s-60s, blood pressure ranging from 154/41 to 125/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count (20.2), low platelet count (300), slightly elevated creatinine (0.8), and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals an irregular rhythm, a systolic murmur at the left sternal border, diffuse rhonchi in the lungs, and trace lower extremity edema.

Assessment and plan:
1. Duodenal bleeding: The patient has a known gastrointestinal bleed in the duodenal bulb, which was treated with endoscopic clipping. His hematocrit level is stable"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and recent duodenal bleeding. He presents with melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (Hct) due to the duodenal bleed. The patient has been managed with NPO (nothing by mouth) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a percutaneous internal jugular vein catheter (PICC). Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) IV has been continued twice daily. The patient's heart rate has been in the 30s-50s while sleeping, possibly related to digoxin use. Digoxin has been discontinued, and metoprolol has been held. The patient also has a history of COPD and is being treated with albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers. He has pneumonia with sputum growing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin has been continued for an additional 4 days. The patient's recent code status was reversed for an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), but it has now been changed back to do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI). The patient is being dispositioned to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Duodenal bleeding: The patient has a known gastrointestinal (GI) bleed in the duodenal bulb, which was managed with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old male with a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and duodenal bleed. He is currently in the ICU due to melena and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (HCT) caused by a duodenal bleed. The patient has been stable with an HCT of 31.6%. He has been ambulating in the hallway, and his Foley catheter was removed. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/34-161/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has trace left lower extremity edema and an irregular rhythm with a normal to mildly bradycardic rate. He also has a systolic murmur at the left sternal border, course breath sounds with rales at the left base, and normal abdomen. The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 22.8 K/uL, slightly elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.7 mg/dL, normal glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Duodenal bleeding: The patient has a known gastrointestinal bleed in the duodenal bulb, which was managed with endoscopic clip placement. His HCT has remained stable. The plan includes maintaining the patient on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) through a percutaneous internal jugular central catheter (PICC), continuing pantoprazole IV twice daily, monitoring hemoglobin concentration, maintaining active telemetry monitoring, and holding aspirin, doxazosin, and metoprolol.
2. Atrial fibrillation/bradycardia: The patient's heart rate has been in the range of 30s-60s. EKGs remain unchanged. The plan includes monitoring on telemetry, continuing digoxin with a level of 0.8, and holding metoprolol.
3. Bradycardia: The patient's EKG baseline is unchanged, with no evidence of ischemia. Possible medication effect of digoxin is suspected. The plan includes holding metoprolol.
4. Recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient's aspirin is being held temporarily due to the bleeding risk. Aspirin will be restarted when the bleed is controlled.
5. Leukocytosis: The patient's WBC count has risen to 20.2, likely due to a pulmonary source. The plan includes follow-up pending cultures, continuing vancomycin for suspected Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum on day 3 of 8, and discontinuing cefepime as gram-negative rod coverage is not needed.
6. History of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The plan includes continuing ne"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 84-year-old male who was admitted with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient underwent endoscopy and showed some variation in hematocrit levels but without evidence of brisk recurrence of bleeding. The patient also experienced intermittent bradycardia while on digoxin therapy, which has been largely asymptomatic but had rates as low as 40 beats per minute across time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed:
- The patient continues to receive pantoprazole (Protonix) to reduce gastric acid production and maintain active therapeutic blood supply.
- The patient has peripheral IV access maintained.

2. Bradycardia:
- The patient's digoxin level will be checked to assess its contribution to the bradycardia.
- The dose of digoxin will be decreased to address the issue.
- A follow-up electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed to monitor the patient's heart rhythm.

3. Aspiration Risk (S/P CVA):
- The patient's aspiration risk is a concern due to recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and long-standing aspiration concerns.
- The patient will be maintained NPO (nothing by mouth) status at this time.
- Continuous IV nutrition will be provided, and the timing of feeding tube placement will be considered while taking into account the GI bleed.

ICU Care:
- The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN)"
