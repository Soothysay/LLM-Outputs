   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   1. Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of >104,
   tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. Likely source is
   pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1, however following fluid
   administration is 1.9. Pt received Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin
   in the ED. Will initiate Zosyn IV and continue Levofloxacin for double
   strep/staph coverage. Will continue Vanc as pt has h.o. of MRSA. As
   below, transiently required pressor support with Levophed.
   --> Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin
   --> Sputum cx, bld cx, urine legionella pending, resent once on floor
   --> Maintain CVP 8-12
   --> Maintain MAP > 65
   --> Continue to trend WBC, bandemia
   .
   2. Hypotension: Likely [**3-5**] infection/sepsis. Pt received a total of 5l
   NS in the ED however still noted to have a SBP in the 90s. Pt was
   started on Levophed gtt in the ED. Hypotension may be a combination of
   hypovolemic state [**3-5**] poor PO intake, SIRS and Fentanyl/Versed. Will
   continue to give an additional NS bolus and titrate Levophed for a MAP
   >65. Give his concomittant tachycardia will like switch from Levophed
   to Phenylephrine if more pressor support is needed particularly as
   there will be less beta 1 receptor activation.
   --> repeat 1l NS bolus
   --> titrate Levophed for MAP >65, wean as tolerated
   --> Will consider switch from Levophed to Phenylephrine if he has
   persistent tachycardia and requirement of pressor support.
   .
   3. Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15, will
   transfuse 2u now. Will guaiaic stools x 3, start PPI [**Hospital1 **] though likely
   LGI bld. Patient endorses over the past few days BRBPR quantified as
   enough to fill a toilet [**Last Name (LF) 3860**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] son he has a history of BRBPR from
   ?hemorrhoids.? GI source versus malignancy related (met prostate ca).
   --> Transfuse 2 units PRBCs
   --> Repeat Hct, transfuse to goal of 21.
   --> PPI started, guaiaic stools x 3
   --> Consider GI consult in am.
   .
   4. Pneumonia: Chest x-ray in ED notable for RLL and RML PNA, pt noted
   to have volumous secretions from his trach as well as a fever (rectal
   temp 104.4), leukocytosis to 12.6 with bandemia. Prior to transfer to
   the floor he was noted to be hypoxic requiring intubation and
   ventilatory support. Hypotension has also been noted requiring
   Levophed. Will also start pt on an ARDS protocol for ventilation given
   the appearance of his CXR.
   --> As mentioned above Zosyn, Levofloxacin for double strep and staph
   coverage
   --> Will also start Vancomycin for MRSA coverage
   --> Sputum cultures, urinary legionella ordered.
   --> Follow bcx as above
   --> Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on PSV
   and tolerating well
   --> Morphine prn pleuritic pain
   .
   5. New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED at a
   rate within the 200s, diltiazem 10mg IV x 2 reduced HR to 150s, fluid
   administration further lowered to 130s. On arrival to the floor pt
   received an additional 10mg IV Diltiazem which reduced his HR to
   100-120s and received PO 12.5mg Metoprolol Tartrate x 1. Given his new
   Hct tachycardia is most likely compensatory, will hold beta blockers
   and assess response to transfusions.
   --> TTE ordered in the AM to assess new A. fib
   --> Will hold beta blockers until transfusion.
   --> Dilt as needed
   .
   6. Acute Kidney Injury: Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2, pt
   currently is in [**Last Name (un) **] with a Creatinine of 1.8. [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   given his current state of hypovolemia and anema.
   --> trend Cr following fluid administration
   --> Send urine lytes in am if no improvement
   .
   7. Anion Gap Acidosis: Pt has AG of 17, Anion Gap acidosis, given
   elevated lactic acid most likely lactic acidosis.
   - Continue to trend, no need for bicarb at this time
   .
   8. Hypotyhroidism: Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine
   .
   9. FEN/Lytes: NPO overnight, cardiac diet in am, replete lytes prn, IVF
   prn
   .
   10. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, already on PPI. Hold on SQH given
   bleed/anemia

   Disposition:
","The patient's progress note indicates multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of >104, tachypnea, and white blood count with bandemia. Likely source is pneumonia. The patient received Levofloxacin, Cefepime, and Vancomycin in the ED.

2. Hypotension: The patient had persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation. Pressor support with Levophed was required. The hypotension may be due to hypovolemia, poor oral intake, SIRS, and the effects of Fentanyl/Versed. Additional NS bolus will be given and Levophed will be titrated for a MAP >65. If more pressor support is needed, Phenylephrine will be considered.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, with a Hct of 23 on admission, which is likely artificially elevated due to hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15, and 2 units of PRBCs will be transfused now. PPI has been started, and guaiacol stools will be done x3. A GI consult may be considered.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of right lower and middle lobe pneumonia on chest x-ray, along with fever, leukocytosis, and band"

   Assessment and Plan
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   1. Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of 102,
   tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC have trended down to
   6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is
   pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1, however following fluid
   administration is 1.9. Pt was started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime,
   Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started yesterday for broad
   coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage, Vancomycin for MRSA
   coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Last night pt intermittently required
   pressure support of Levophed however following placement of A-line his
   MAP have been >65 and Levophed has been discontinued.
   --> Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if
   cultures turn positive
   --> Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send
   DFA for influenza.
   --> Maintain MAP > 65
   --> Continue to trend WBC, bandemia.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive on transfer to the floor
   likely [**3-5**] infection/sepsis. Pt received a total of 5l NS in the ED
   however still noted to have a SBP in the 90s. Pt was started on
   Levophed gtt in the ED. Hypotension may be a combination of hypovolemic
   state [**3-5**] poor PO intake, SIRS and Fentanyl/Versed. Following placement
   of A-line MAPs have been >65, pt has not required any Levoiphed.
   --> continue to monitor for MAP >65
   .
   3. Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this morning s/p 2units.  23.8 not true post-transfusion Hct will
   recheck at 1200 and transfuse for a goal Hct of >25. Will continue
   guaiaic stools x 3, PPI [**Hospital1 **] though likely LGI bld. Patient endorses
   over the past few days BRBPR quantified as enough to fill a toilet
   [**Last Name (LF) 3860**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] son he has a history of BRBPR from ?hemorrhoids.? GI source
   versus malignancy related (met prostate ca). Will consult GI today and
   keep NPO pending their consult
   --> Repeat Hct at 1200, transfuse to goal of 25
   --> PPI started, guaiaic stools x 3
   --> GI consult today, f.u GI recs.
   .
   4. Pneumonia: Chest x-ray in ED notable for RLL and RML PNA, pt noted
   to have volumous secretions from his trach as well as a fever (rectal
   temp 104.4), leukocytosis to 12.6 with bandemia. Prior to transfer to
   the floor he was noted to be hypoxic requiring intubation and
   ventilatory support. Hypotension has also been noted requiring
   Levophed. Pt started on ARDs protocol though he is taking in volume
   greater than 6cc/kg.
   --> As mentioned above Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin
   --> Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   --> Follow bcx as above
   --> Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on PSV
   and tolerating well
   .
   5. New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED at a
   rate within the 200s, diltiazem 10mg IV x 2 reduced HR to 150s, fluid
   administration further lowered to 130s. On arrival to the floor pt
   received an additional 10mg IV Diltiazem x 3 on the floor which reduced
   his HR to 100-120s and received PO 12.5mg Metoprolol Tartrate x 1.
   Last night pt spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm, unclear as to the
   etiology of the A. fib, tachycardia most likely [**3-5**] poor volemic state.
   Will ass TSH to ensure A fib is not secondary supratherapeutic
   Synthroid dose. TTE has been order for today.
   --> TTE ordered today to assess new A. fib
 If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID if
   BP can tolerate.
   .
   6. Acute Kidney Injury: Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2, pt
   currently is in [**Last Name (un) **] with a Creatinine of 1.4 improved from 1.8. [**Last Name (un) **]
   most likely pre-renal given his current state of hypovolemia and anema.
   Pt still having poor urine output which may a sign that he is still
   pre-renal versus ATN. Will continue to monitor. Will check urine lytes.
   --> trend Cr following fluid administration
   --> Send urine lytes in am if no improvement
   .
   7. Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENt
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   .
   8. Agitation: Pt will get agitated to the point that his blood pressure
   increases to the high 180s, becomes tachycardic, RR in the 40s and
   hypoxic to the mid 80s. Pt was receiving prn Lorazepam and Morphine
   yesterday however given his continued agitation Versed and Fentanyl
   drip were started.
 Titrate Versed and Fentanyl gtt for anxiety control
   .
   9. Hypotyhroidism: Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine. Will check
   TSH to ensure pt is not supratherapeutic given his new onset A. fib.
   .
   10. FEN/Lytes: NPO today until  GI recs given the concern for bld,
   replete lytes prn, IVF prn
   .
   11. Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, already on PPI. Hold on SQH given
   bleed/anemia

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The chest x-ray shows right lower lobe and right middle lobe pneumonia. The patient is already on antibiotics (Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin) for broad coverage, and sputum cultures are pending.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with tachycardia, fever, and elevated white blood cell count with bandemia. It is likely that the source of SIRS is pneumonia. The lactate level initially noted to be high but improved following fluid administration.

3. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive on transfer to the floor likely due to infection/sepsis. The patient received a total of 5 liters of normal saline in the emergency department but still had a systolic blood pressure in the 90s. The patient was started on Levophed in the emergency department, and after the placement of an arterial line, mean arterial pressure (MAP) has been >65, and Levophed has been discontinued.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, with a hematocrit (Hct) of approximately 23% last year. On admission, the Hct was 24"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of metastatic prostate cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, and a smoking history. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to multifocal pneumonia, hematochezia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib w/ RVR), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's current condition indicates that he is critically ill, requiring mechanical ventilation and multiple lines for treatment.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to multifocal pneumonia. Complications associated with this condition may include worsening hypoxemia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and barotrauma.

2. Hematochezia: Hematochezia refers to the passage of fresh blood per rectum. Complications related to this condition may include gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, and potential need for transfusions.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib w/ RVR): AFib w/ RVR is a cardiac arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular heartbeats. Complications associated with this condition may include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, stroke, and heart failure.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): ARF is a sudden decline in kidney function. Complications associated with this condition may include electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had a midline placed, femoral left for now prior to scope.
   - Hct went to 23.8 from 21.8 and he was transfused another 2 units of
   PRBC (total of 4 units here).  His Hct bumped to 28.4.
   - Plan is to have a family morning tomorrow at 1 and then determine if
   he should be scoped pending the discussion at the meeting.
   - TTE showed: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, EF>55%.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Biatrial
   enlargement.
   - TSH was 3.0
   - FiO2 weaned down to 70% (7.32/32/123) --> 60% (7.29/34/114) --> 60%
   (7.27/38/147) --> 50%
   - SP's decreased to the 70's and he was given a 1 L NS bolus and
   started on his second unit of blood in addition to being restarted on
   levophed uptitrated to the max dose.  This was weaned down somewhat,
   however it needed to be weaned back up so his sedation could be
   increased to allow bigger tidal volumes.
   - Spiked to 101.5 and cultures were sent.

   Assessment and Plan
   # Sepsis: The patient continues Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia.
   Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1,
   however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was started on
   Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started for
   broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage, Vancomycin for MRSA
   coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he became hypotensive and
   required pressure support again with Levophed as well as many IVF
   boluses.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, weaning levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a bicarb of 13 and a pH on ABG of
   7.21.  His AG is 14.  Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary
   to decreased ventilatory compensation and the large amount of NS he
   received yesterday.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will attempt to increase his tidal volume to induce a respiratory
   alkalosis to help compensate for his acidosis.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this s/p 2units two days ago.  Yesterday am his Hct was again low
   at 21.8 so he was transfused another 2 units of PRBC (for a total of 4
   units).  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Will address goals of care at the family meeting today before
   deciding if to scope.
   - Q8H hct checks
   - Active type and screen
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on CMV
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   vs ATN given his recent hypotension. Pt still having poor urine output
   which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENT
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH was normal at 3.0.
   -  Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine.

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly Asian male who was admitted to the ICU for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He presented with hypotension and was found to have a high fever, tachycardia, and hypoxia upon admission. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

During his stay in the ICU, the patient received several blood transfusions due to low hemoglobin levels. His heart function appears to be preserved with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. However, he does have mild aortic regurgitation and mild pulmonary hypertension. The patient's TSH level is within normal range.

The patient's vital signs have fluctuated throughout the day, with an increase in temperature and a decrease in blood pressure. His oxygen saturation has been maintained at around 98%. The patient is sedated with fentanyl and midazolam, and his sedation level needs to be adjusted to allow for bigger tidal volumes during ventilation.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) and assist control mode. The tidal volume is set at 350 mL, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, and PEEP at 12 cmH2O. FiO2 is currently set at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a slightly low pH, elevated PaCO2, and normal oxygen saturation.

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears tired but cooperative. His heart rhythm is irregular"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had a midline placed, femoral left for now prior to scope.
   - Hct went to 23.8 from 21.8 and he was transfused another 2 units of
   PRBC (total of 4 units here).  His Hct bumped to 28.4.
   - Plan is to have a family morning tomorrow at 1 and then determine if
   he should be scoped pending the discussion at the meeting.
   - TTE showed: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, EF>55%.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Biatrial
   enlargement.
   - TSH was 3.0
   - FiO2 weaned down to 70% (7.32/32/123) --> 60% (7.29/34/114) --> 60%
   (7.27/38/147) --> 50%
   - SP's decreased to the 70's and he was given a 1 L NS bolus and
   started on his second unit of blood in addition to being restarted on
   levophed uptitrated to the max dose.  This was weaned down somewhat,
   however it needed to be weaned back up so his sedation could be
   increased to allow bigger tidal volumes.
   - Spiked to 101.5 and cultures were sent.
   - UOP was low so gave 500 CC bolus x 2

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Sepsis: The patient continues Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia.
   Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1,
   however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was started on
   Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started for
   broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage, Vancomycin for MRSA
   coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he became hypotensive and
   required pressure support again with Levophed as well as many IVF
   boluses.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, weaning levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a bicarb of 13 and a pH on ABG of
   7.21.  His AG is 14.  Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary
   to decreased ventilatory compensation and the large amount of NS he
   received yesterday.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will attempt to increase his tidal volume to induce a respiratory
   alkalosis to help compensate for his acidosis.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this s/p 2units two days ago.  Yesterday am his Hct was again low
   at 21.8 so he was transfused another 2 units of PRBC (for a total of 4
   units).  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Will address goals of care at the family meeting today before
   deciding if to scope.
   - Q8H hct checks
   - Active type and screen
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on CMV
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   vs ATN given his recent hypotension. Pt still having poor urine output
   which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENT
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH was normal at 3.0.
   -  Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine.

","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He is now septic and intubated.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis with tachycardia, temperature of 102, tachypnea, and white blood count with bandemia. The likely source of SIRS is pneumonia. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin. He required pressor support with Levophed due to hypotension.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis with a bicarb of 13 and a pH of 7.21. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to decreased ventilatory compensation and the large amount of normal saline he received yesterday. He will be monitored closely for any changes in his condition.

The patient's hemoglobin levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 23.8 to 21.8. He has been transfused with a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. Anemia is present, but no further clinical evidence of bleeding has been observed.

The patient's chest x-ray shows worsening pneumonia. He is on ARDS protocol, but his urinary Legionella antigen is negative. Cultures have been ordered, including"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Patient had a midline placed, femoral left for now prior to scope.
   - Hct went to 23.8 from 21.8 and he was transfused another 2 units of
   PRBC (total of 4 units here).  His Hct bumped to 28.4.
   - Plan is to have a family morning tomorrow at 1 and then determine if
   he should be scoped pending the discussion at the meeting.
   - TTE showed: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with
   preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, EF>55%.
   Mild aortic regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension. Biatrial
   enlargement.
   - TSH was 3.0
   - FiO2 weaned down to 70% (7.32/32/123) --> 60% (7.29/34/114) --> 60%
   (7.27/38/147) --> 50%
   - SP's decreased to the 70's and he was given a 1 L NS bolus and
   started on his second unit of blood in addition to being restarted on
   levophed uptitrated to the max dose.  This was weaned down somewhat,
   however it needed to be weaned back up so his sedation could be
   increased to allow bigger tidal volumes.
   - Spiked to 101.5 and cultures were sent.
   - UOP was low so gave 500 CC bolus x 2

   Assessment and Plan
   1. Sepsis: Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, temperature of 102,
   tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC have trended down to
   6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is
   pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1, however following fluid
   administration is 1.9. Pt was started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime,
   Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started yesterday for broad
   coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage, Vancomycin for MRSA
   coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Last night pt intermittently required
   pressure support of Levophed however following placement of A-line his
   MAP have been >65 and Levophed has been discontinued.
   --> Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if
   cultures turn positive
   --> Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send
   DFA for influenza.
   --> Maintain MAP > 65
   --> Continue to trend WBC, bandemia.
   .
   2. Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive on transfer to the floor
   likely [**3-5**] infection/sepsis. Pt received a total of 5l NS in the ED
   however still noted to have a SBP in the 90s. Pt was started on
   Levophed gtt in the ED. Hypotension may be a combination of hypovolemic
   state [**3-5**] poor PO intake, SIRS and Fentanyl/Versed. Following placement
   of A-line MAPs have been >65, pt has not required any Levoiphed.
   --> continue to monitor for MAP >65
   .
   3. Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this morning s/p 2units.  23.8 not true post-transfusion Hct will
   recheck at 1200 and transfuse for a goal Hct of >25. Will continue
   guaiaic stools x 3, PPI [**Hospital1 **] though likely LGI bld. Patient endorses
   over the past few days BRBPR quantified as enough to fill a toilet
   [**Last Name (LF) 3860**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] son he has a history of BRBPR from ?hemorrhoids.? GI source
   versus malignancy related (met prostate ca). Will consult GI today and
   keep NPO pending their consult
   --> Repeat Hct at 1200, transfuse to goal of 25
   --> PPI started, guaiaic stools x 3
   --> GI consult today, f.u GI recs.
   .
   4. Pneumonia: Chest x-ray in ED notable for RLL and RML PNA, pt noted
   to have volumous secretions from his trach as well as a fever (rectal
   temp 104.4), leukocytosis to 12.6 with bandemia. Prior to transfer to
   the floor he was noted to be hypoxic requiring intubation and
   ventilatory support. Hypotension has also been noted requiring
   Levophed. Pt started on ARDs protocol though he is taking in volume
   greater than 6cc/kg.
   --> As mentioned above Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin
   --> Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   --> Follow bcx as above
   --> Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on PSV
   and tolerating well
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED at a
   rate within the 200s, diltiazem 10mg IV x 2 reduced HR to 150s, fluid
   administration further lowered to 130s. On arrival to the floor pt
   received an additional 10mg IV Diltiazem x 3 on the floor which reduced
   his HR to 100-120s and received PO 12.5mg Metoprolol Tartrate x 1.
   Last night pt spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm, unclear as to the
   etiology of the A. fib, tachycardia most likely [**3-5**] poor volemic state.
   Will ass TSH to ensure A fib is not secondary supratherapeutic
   Synthroid dose. TTE has been order for today.   TTE showed a normal EF
   and biatrial enlargement which could predispose to a.fib.  He has been
   in sinus rhythm.
   --> TTE ordered today to assess new A. fib
 If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider Metoprolol 12.5 mg TID if
   BP can tolerate.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   given his current state of hypovolemia and anema. Pt still having poor
   urine output which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENt
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   # Agitation: Pt will get agitated to the point that his blood pressure
   increases to the high 180s, becomes tachycardic, RR in the 40s and
   hypoxic to the mid 80s. Pt was receiving prn Lorazepam and Morphine
   yesterday however given his continued agitation Versed and Fentanyl
   drip were started.
 Titrate Versed and Fentanyl gtt for anxiety control
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH was normal at 3.0.
   -  Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old elderly Asian male who is intubated and admitted to the ICU. He has a history of anemia, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer. The patient presented with sepsis, hypotension, anemia, pneumonia, and new-onset atrial fibrillation. His current condition includes acute kidney injury, agitation, and hypothyroidism. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, vasopressors, blood transfusions, and supportive care. The patient's medical team is considering a tracheostomy for long-term ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia, fever, tachypnea, and bandemia. The likely source of SIRS is pneumonia. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a risk of complications such as multi-organ dysfunction or septic shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive despite fluid administration and vasopressor support. This may be due to a combination of hypovolemia, poor oral intake, SIRS, and medication effects. Close monitoring of blood pressure and continued use of vasopressors are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his Hct has fluctuated between 15% and 28.4%. He requires ongoing blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a bicarb of 13 and a pH on ABG of
   7.21.  His AG is 14.  Likely a mixed metabolic acidosis secondary to
   renal failure.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will attempt to increase his tidal volume to induce a respiratory
   alkalosis to help compensate for his acidosis.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   - Consider giving IVF with bicarb if he continues to drop his pH.
   # Sepsis: The patient continues Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia.
   Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1,
   however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was started on
   Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started
   yesterday for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Last night pt
   intermittently required pressure support of Levophed however following
   placement of A-line his MAP have been >65 and Levophed has been
   discontinued.
   --> Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if
   cultures turn positive
   --> Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send
   DFA for influenza.
   --> Maintain MAP > 65
   --> Continue to trend WBC, bandemia.
   # Hypotension: Pt was initially hypotensive on transfer to the floor
   likely [**3-5**] infection/sepsis. Pt received a total of 5l NS in the ED
   however still noted to have a SBP in the 90s. Pt was started on
   Levophed gtt in the ED. Hypotension may be a combination of hypovolemic
   state [**3-5**] poor PO intake, SIRS and Fentanyl/Versed. Following placement
   of A-line MAPs have been >65, pt has not required any Levoiphed.
   --> continue to monitor for MAP >65
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this morning s/p 2units.  23.8 not true post-transfusion Hct will
   recheck at 1200 and transfuse for a goal Hct of >25. Will continue
   guaiaic stools x 3, PPI [**Hospital1 **] though likely LGI bld. Patient endorses
   over the past few days BRBPR quantified as enough to fill a toilet
   [**Last Name (LF) 3860**], [**First Name3 (LF) 77**] son he has a history of BRBPR from ?hemorrhoids.? GI source
   versus malignancy related (met prostate ca). Will consult GI today and
   keep NPO pending their consult
   --> Repeat Hct at 1200, transfuse to goal of 25
   --> PPI started, guaiaic stools x 3
   --> GI consult today, f.u GI recs.
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray in ED notable for RLL and RML PNA, pt noted to
   have volumous secretions from his trach as well as a fever (rectal temp
   104.4), leukocytosis to 12.6 with bandemia. Prior to transfer to the
   floor he was noted to be hypoxic requiring intubation and ventilatory
   support. Hypotension has also been noted requiring Levophed. Pt started
   on ARDs protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.
   Urinary legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   --> Follow bcx as above
   --> Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on PSV
   and tolerating well
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED at a
   rate within the 200s, diltiazem 10mg IV x 2 reduced HR to 150s, fluid
   administration further lowered to 130s. On arrival to the floor pt
   received an additional 10mg IV Diltiazem x 3 on the floor which reduced
   his HR to 100-120s and received PO 12.5mg Metoprolol Tartrate x 1.  Two
   nights ago he spontaneously reverted to sinus rhythm, unclear as to the
   etiology of the A. fib, tachycardia most likely [**3-5**] poor volemic state.
   TSH was normal. TTE showed a normal EF and biatrial enlargement which
   could predispose to a.fib.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   given his current state of hypovolemia and anema. Pt still having poor
   urine output which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENt
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   # Agitation: Pt will get agitated to the point that his blood pressure
   increases to the high 180s, becomes tachycardic, RR in the 40s and
   hypoxic to the mid 80s. Pt was receiving prn Lorazepam and Morphine
   yesterday however given his continued agitation Versed and Fentanyl
   drip were started.
 Titrate Versed and Fentanyl gtt for anxiety control
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH was normal at 3.0.
   -  Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine.

","Summary:
- The patient is a 62-year-old Asian male admitted to the ICU with a history of metastatic prostate cancer, anemia, and hypertension.
- He underwent a midline placement, femoral left for now, and received transfusions of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a decrease in hemoglobin concentration from 21.8 to 23.8.
- The patient's TSH level is normal, indicating no current hypothyroidism.
- He has a mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global and regional biventricular systolic function, mild aortic regurgitation, mild pulmonary hypertension, and biatrial enlargement.
- The patient's condition is complicated by metabolic acidosis, sepsis, hypotension, anemia, pneumonia, new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, agitation, and a stoma.
- He requires mechanical ventilation and pressor support.
- The patient has a history of bowel irregularity and is currently on prophylactic antibiotics, including Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a bicarbonate level of 13 and a pH of 7.21, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to renal failure. Measures should be taken to maintain perfusion to the kidneys and induce respiratory alkalosis to help compensate for the acidosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The note mentions the following potential medical complications:

1. Presumed sepsis with respiratory infection as the likely source. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin, Zosyn, and levofloxacin. The dose of vancomycin is being increased to 1g q12 due to the presence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the urine.

2. Respiratory failure due to multifocal right-sided pneumonia. The patient is already receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) with a low tidal volume strategy. A tracheostomy is planned for better intubation and improved positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). The treatment for pneumonia includes antibiotics as mentioned earlier, influenza screening, monitoring for wheezing and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (iPEEP), and weaning of FiO2.

3. Hematocchezia, which responded appropriately to packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion. The patient is being kept nothing by mouth (NPO) and bowel rest, with serial hemoglobin checks. A gastrointestinal consult has been requested.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFIB/VR), likely related to hypovolemia. Rate control has been achieved, and the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are normal. An echocardiogram shows biatrial"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Presumed sepsis: The patient has signs of infection, possibly from a respiratory infection source. This could lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's underlying smoking history and multifocal right-sided pneumonia have resulted in respiratory failure. This condition requires immediate attention, including intubation and mechanical ventilation.

3. Hematocchezia: The patient is experiencing bleeding, as indicated by the presence of blood in the urine. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and treat it appropriately.

4. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response: The patient developed atrial fibrillation likely due to hypovolemia. Rate control measures need to be implemented to manage this cardiac arrhythmia.

5. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which may be related to hypovolemia. Close monitoring and careful fluid management are essential to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

6. Gastric stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing stress ulcers due to critical illness. Prophylactic treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be initiated to prevent this complication.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as wearing boots"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Sepsis: The patient continues Meets SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive bandemia.
   Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted to be 6.1,
   however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was started on
   Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was started for
   broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage, Vancomycin for MRSA
   coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he became hypotensive and
   required pressure support again with Levophed as well as many IVF
   boluses.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, weaning levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a bicarb of 13 and a pH on ABG of
   7.21.  His AG is 14.  Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary
   to decreased ventilatory compensation and the large amount of NS he
   received yesterday.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will attempt to increase his tidal volume to induce a respiratory
   alkalosis to help compensate for his acidosis.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this s/p 2units two days ago.  Yesterday am his Hct was again low
   at 21.8 so he was transfused another 2 units of PRBC (for a total of 4
   units).  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Will address goals of care at the family meeting today before
   deciding if to scope.
   - Q8H hct checks
   - Active type and screen
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on CMV
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   vs ATN given his recent hypotension. Pt still having poor urine output
   which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will

","The patient is a 85-year-old male with a complex medical history including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to meet SIRS criteria and was intubated due to sepsis. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including anemia, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires pressor support with norepinephrine. 

He has a history of bleeding and required blood transfusions. His hemoglobin levels have been low, and he has received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells. 

The patient's chest x-ray shows worsening pneumonia, and his urinary legionella antigen is negative. He is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin for coverage against MRSA. 

His metabolic acidosis is likely secondary to decreased ventilatory compensation and large-volume normal saline administration. 

The patient's acute kidney injury may be pre-renal or due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given his recent hypotension and poor urine output. 

Other issues include a stoma, hypothyroidism, and the need for ongoing nutritional support and glycemic control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of"

   Assessment and Plan
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as many IVF boluses.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, weaning levophed as tolerated.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a bicarb of 13 and a pH on ABG of
   7.21.  His AG is 14.  Nonanion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary
   to decreased ventilatory compensation and the large amount of NS he
   received yesterday.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will attempt to increase his tidal volume to induce a respiratory
   alkalosis to help compensate for his acidosis.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Repeat Hct noted to be 15 last night and
   23.8 this s/p 2units two days ago.  Yesterday am his Hct was again low
   at 21.8 so he was transfused another 2 units of PRBC (for a total of 4
   units).  No further clinical evidence of bleeding.
   - Appreciate GI consult, will f/u recs
   - Will address goals of care at the family meeting today before
   deciding if to scope.
   - Q8H hct checks
   - Active type and screen
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on ARDS protocol, wean as tolerated, on CMV
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased back to 1.8 (from
   1.4). Prior Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  [**Last Name (un) **] most likely pre-renal
   vs ATN given his recent hypotension. Pt still having poor urine output
   which has been unresponsive to IVF.
   - trend Cr
   - check urinary electrolytes
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. Will discuss with ENT
   whether a trach would be better suited for ventilator treatment rather
   than the stoma.
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH was normal at 3.0.
   -  Continue home regimen of Levothyroxine.

He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to have sepsis and intubated.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 56 beats per minute, blood pressure of 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. His general appearance is tired-looking, and he has slightly edematous extremities with weak right radial pulse. His lungs are clear bilaterally, and his cardiac exam shows regular tachycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.7 g/dL and a hematocrit of 28.9%. His white blood cell count is elevated at 11.5 K/uL with bandemia. Other lab results include elevated levels of creatinine (2.7 mg/dL), lactate (1.9 mmol/L), and lactic acid (1.0 mmol/L), as well as low potassium (3.0 mEq/L), magnesium (2.1 mg/dL), and calcium (7.2 mg/d"

   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   # Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Will
   give D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 today to aid with pH. If pt requires any
   more IVF boluses will use LR and monitor for possible hyperkalemia
   given his current [**Last Name (un) **].
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - Will give 1l D5W with 3 amps HCO3 today, if further IVF needed will
   bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   - Continue to follow his pH on ABGs.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on pressure support and decrease sedation as
   CXR doesn
t show evidence of ARDS, wean as tolerated
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr increased 2.7, baseline
   Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Given low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely
   [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will continue to give fluid today and monitor
   UOP.
   - trend Cr
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - Will consult ENT again today for trach placement as it is likely pt
   will need to be intubated over the next few days.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He is currently septic and intubated.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from the information given in the progress note:

1. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his initial hematocrit (Hct) was 24, which is likely artificially elevated due to hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. He received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and his Hct has stabilized at 30. Monitoring his Hct and type and screening for blood compatibility is important.

2. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, most likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Giving D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 today to aid with pH is recommended. If the patient requires any more intravenous fluid boluses, using lactated Ringer's (LR) solution and monitoring electrolytes for possible hyperkalemia is important.

3. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension requiring pressor support. Maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and considering the use of vasop"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with several medical complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has bacterial pneumonia, which is evident from the diffuse alveolar infiltrate in the right hemithorax on the chest X-ray. This infection can lead to respiratory failure and sepsis.

2. Hypotension: The patient has persistent hypotension despite vasopressor support. This could indicate a state of distributive shock, possibly secondary to septic shock due to the ongoing infection.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's rising creatinine levels suggest acute renal failure. This may be due to factors such as hypotension leading to decreased renal perfusion, or direct renal injury from the infection or toxins.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to volume resuscitation with normal saline. This can occur in critically ill patients who receive large volumes of normal saline.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, likely from hemorrhage or bleeding. This can contribute to hypotension and tissue hypoperfusion.

6. Ventilatory Support: The patient requires mechanical ventilation with a combination of controlled mandatory ventilation (CMV) and assist-control ventilation (AC). This indicates severe respiratory compromise.

7. Fluid Balance: The patient has received a significant amount of fluids,"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks XXX. Culture data thus far
   negative to date. Pt started on ARDs protocol though he is taking in
   volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on pressure support and decrease sedation as
   CXR doesn
t show evidence of ARDS, wean as tolerated
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Urine lytes have been
   ordered, will again administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis from NS fluid resuscitationGiven low
   urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will continue to
   give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - Will consult ENT again today for trach placement as it is likely pt
   will need to be intubated over the next few days.

","The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to have sepsis and was intubated. The patient has several medical complications including pneumonia, metabolic acidosis, anemia, acute kidney injury, and new-onset atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already septic and intubated, so there is a risk of further deterioration or development of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, and the chest x-ray confirms the presence of infiltrates. There is a risk of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or failure.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to fluid resuscitation. Monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are necessary to prevent further complications.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his current hemoglobin levels are low. Close monitoring and possible transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen delivery to tissues.

5. Acute kidney injury: The patient's serum creatinine levels have increased, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to have sepsis and intubated. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate 70 bpm, blood pressure 117/42 mmHg, respiratory rate 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 98% on the ventilator. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.33, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 156. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, anemia, and acute kidney injury.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the presence of central venous lines increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient's critical illness and the use of corticosteroids may predispose him to stress ulcers.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various medications, including Vancomycin, Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Fentanyl, and Midazolam. The patient's vital signs show a fever with a maximum temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate within normal limits, low blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and is receiving supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of a fever. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring indicates fluid balance with a total input of 2,837 mL and output of 738 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,099 mL. The patient's respiratory support shows a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 36 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 156 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no assessment of peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hematocrit (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), low total carbon dioxide (TCO2), normal glucose levels, and abnormal results for various other lab parameters including PT/PTT/INR, CK/CKMB/Troponin-T, differential, electrolytes, and lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient's low hematocrit levels suggest anemia, which may be due to blood loss.
2. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient's ABG results indicate a lower-than-normal pH level, indicating metabolic acidosis.
3. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, which can be a concern for hypotension. However, the note specifies that it is not due to shock.
4. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient's fever, abnormal lab results, and need for mechanical ventilation suggest a possible bacterial pneumonia.
5. ICU acquired complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and pressure ulcers should also be considered given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly Asian male who was admitted to the ICU with acute anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 70-108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 117/42 to 198/112 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,837 mL and output of 738 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,099 mL.

The patient is receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam). Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, increased oxygen requirements, and potential sepsis.
2. Bleeding/Hemorrhage: The patient's acute anemia is secondary to blood loss, indicating a risk of further bleeding. This could result in hypotension and shock if not properly"

   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, narrow spectrum if cultures
   turn positive; will increase vanc dosing to daily as his vanc trough
   was low today.
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, will send DFA
   for influenza.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Chest x-ray today looks worse. Hypotension returned
   yesterday requiring Levophed to be restarted. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, and Vancomycin with increased vanc
   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Continue vent support on pressure support and decrease sedation as
   CXR doesn
t show evidence of ARDS, wean as tolerated
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Urine lytes have been
   ordered, will again administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis from NS fluid resuscitationGiven low
   urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will continue to
   give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - Will consult ENT again today for trach placement as it is likely pt
   will need to be intubated over the next few days.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to have sepsis, likely secondary to pneumonia, and was intubated. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including levofloxacin, cefepime, and vancomycin. He required vasopressor support and has since been weaned off it. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, anemia, acute kidney injury, new-onset atrial fibrillation, and a stoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by an overwhelming immune response to infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly and effectively.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if the current antibiotic therapy is ineffective or if there is an underlying resistant infection. This could result in further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's non-anion gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to massive fluid resuscitation with normal saline. It is important to monitor and correct electrolyte imbalances to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AK"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints include respiratory failure, pneumonia, acute renal failure, hypotension, and acidosis. 

The patient was on pressure support ventilation (PSV) for much of the day yesterday but experienced deteriorating oxygen saturation levels. This was improved with an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 12. The patient's hemodynamic status has been stable, and they have been weaned off of pressors.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and potassium, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Additionally, the patient has hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and a slightly elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 70-108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 106/49 to 101/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 18, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and clear breath sounds on the right side"

   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, narrow spectrum if cultures turn
   positive
   - will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA screen negative
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, DFA for
   influenza pending.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period. Will start pt on bolus of LR for
   IVF resuscitation.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.  As pt has had not decrease in Hct over the past
   few days, will restart Heparin for prophylaxis.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA swab was
   negative
   - Sputum cultures, DFA negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will decrease FiO2 now and see how pt tolerates FiO2 of 40%. Will
   also aim to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8 with the goal of transitioning
   to trach mask with frequent suctioning of secretions.
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # Nutrition: Pt has been without nutrition, will consult nutrition
   regarding TF via NGT.
   - Nutrition consult for TF
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Pt
s Creatinine with fluid
   resuscitation with urin output approx 50cc showed a decrease to 2.3,
   however overnight Creatinine increased back up to 3.0. Urine lytes have
   been ordered with a FENA suspicious for pre-renal. Will again
   administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
s non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis from NS fluid resuscitation for a goal of UOP >50cc/hr. Given
   low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will
   continue to give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   -LR bolus
   # Nutrition: Pt currently has tube feeds via NG tube. Discussed with
   family who states that pt would want all measures of support. Pt
   unlikely to be taking PO [**3-5**] current clinical state. Will consult GI
   for a PEG placement for nutrition, will also obtain Albumin level.
   -Albumin level ordered
   -GI consult for PEG placement
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - ENT placed trach size 7.0 yesterday

   Disposition:
","The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to have sepsis and was intubated. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a tracheostomy tube with assisted mechanical ventilation. His general appearance is that of an elderly Asian male who is intubated via tracheostomy.

The patient has several medical complications. He has pneumonia, as indicated by his symptoms and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has metabolic acidosis, possibly due to fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Additionally, he has acute kidney injury, with an elevated creatinine level and low urine output.

Other findings include anemia, with a history of anemia and a current hematocrit of 30%. The patient has a central line infection, as evidenced by the removal of his femoral central line. He also has a new onset of atrial fibrillation, which resolved spontaneously. 

In terms of treatment, the patient is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, mid"

   dosing as above.
   - Sputum cultures, DFA ordered
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will decrease FiO2 now and see how pt tolerates FiO2 of 40%. Will
   also aim to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8 with the goal of transitioning
   to trach mask with frequent suctioning of secretions.
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # Nutrition: Pt has been without nutrition, will consult nutrition
   regarding TF via NGT.
   - Nutrition consult for TF
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.

   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Urine lytes have been
   ordered, will again administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
   non-anion gap metabolic acidosis from NS fluid resuscitation for a goal
   of UOP >30cc/hr. Given low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus

   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and a non-productive cough. He was diagnosed with sepsis and intubated. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain relief. His laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, bandemia, anemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has also been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation. He has a history of anemia and required a blood transfusion. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and various interventions have been initiated to manage his sepsis, pneumonia, and other medical complications.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis and required aggressive treatment including antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and vasopressor support. There is a potential for the development of septic shock if the infection is not effectively controlled.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely due to aspiration given his history of a tracheostomy and modified radical"

 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, narrow spectrum if cultures turn
   positive
   - will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA screen negative
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, DFA for
   influenza pending.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period. Will start pt on bolus of LR for
   IVF resuscitation.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.  As pt has had not decrease in Hct over the past
   few days, will restart Heparin for prophylaxis.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA swab was
   negative
   - Sputum cultures, DFA negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will decrease FiO2 now and see how pt tolerates FiO2 of 40%. Will
   also aim to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8 with the goal of transitioning
   to trach mask with frequent suctioning of secretions.
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # Nutrition: Pt has been without nutrition, will consult nutrition
   regarding TF via NGT.
   - Nutrition consult for TF
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Pt
s Creatinine with fluid
   resuscitation with urin output approx 50cc showed a decrease to 2.3,
   however overnight Creatinine increased back up to 3.0. Urine lytes have
   been ordered with a FENA suspicious for pre-renal. Will again
   administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
s non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis from NS fluid resuscitation for a goal of UOP >50cc/hr. Given
   low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will
   continue to give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   -LR bolus
   # Nutrition: Pt currently has tube feeds via NG tube. Discussed with
   family who states that pt would want all measures of support. Pt
   unlikely to be taking PO [**3-5**] current clinical state. Will consult GI
   for a PEG placement for nutrition, will also obtain Albumin level.
   -Albumin level ordered
   -GI consult for PEG placement
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - ENT placed trach size 7.0 yesterday

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was diagnosed with sepsis and intubated. The patient has several medical complications, including impaired skin integrity, anemia, metabolic acidosis, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's impaired skin integrity is likely due to prolonged bedrest and immobility. Anemia is a pre-existing condition, but it may have worsened due to blood loss during his surgeries or as a result of sepsis. The metabolic acidosis is non-anion gap and is most likely related to fluid resuscitation with normal saline. Pneumonia is suspected based on the patient's symptoms and the presence of bandemia. Acute kidney injury is indicated by an increase in creatinine levels and low urine output, which could be due to either pre-renal or intrinsic renal damage. Atrial fibrillation was noted in the emergency department but resolved spontaneously.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of the patient's renal function, worsening of pneumonia leading to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), development of pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers due to impaired skin integrity, and potential infections at the site of the tracheostomy or other invasive lines.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and aggressive management to address the various medical complications he is facing."

   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, narrow spectrum if cultures turn
   positive
   - will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA screen negative
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, DFA for
   influenza pending.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period. Will start pt on bolus of LR for
   IVF resuscitation.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.  As pt has had not decrease in Hct over the past
   few days, will restart Heparin for prophylaxis.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA swab was
   negative
   - Sputum cultures, DFA negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will decrease FiO2 now and see how pt tolerates FiO2 of 40%. Will
   also aim to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8 with the goal of transitioning
   to trach mask with frequent suctioning of secretions.
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # Nutrition: Pt has been without nutrition, will consult nutrition
   regarding TF via NGT.
   - Nutrition consult for TF
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Pt
s Creatinine with fluid
   resuscitation with urin output approx 50cc showed a decrease to 2.3,
   however overnight Creatinine increased back up to 3.0. Urine lytes have
   been ordered with a FENA suspicious for pre-renal. Will again
   administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
s non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis from NS fluid resuscitation for a goal of UOP >50cc/hr. Given
   low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will
   continue to give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   -LR bolus
   # Nutrition: Pt currently has tube feeds via NG tube. Discussed with
   family who states that pt would want all measures of support. Pt
   unlikely to be taking PO [**3-5**] current clinical state. Will consult GI
   for a PEG placement for nutrition, will also obtain Albumin level.
   -Albumin level ordered
   -GI consult for PEG placement
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - ENT placed trach size 7.0 yesterday

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially met the criteria for sepsis with tachycardia, fever, tachypnea, and bandemia. Although his WBC count has trended down, he still has impressive bandemia, indicating ongoing inflammation. Pneumonia is likely the source of infection. The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, which is appropriate. Monitoring of his vital signs and continued administration of antibiotics will be important.

2. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis likely related to his fluid resuscitation with normal saline. This can be confirmed by checking his bicarbonate level. Appropriate management includes administration of D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 to correct the acidosis and careful monitoring of his electrolytes, particularly for hyperkalemia.

3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia with a baseline hematocrit (Hct) of approximately 23. His Hct on admission was"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They are currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam. The patient has a history of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, large bowel obstruction, and malnutrition. They are receiving various medications including vancomycin, Zosyn, levofloxacin, heparin, and proton pump inhibitors. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/58 mmHg to 175/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's fluid balance is within normal limits, with a total input of 2,209 mL and output of 1,435 mL. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Proper care and regular assessment of respiratory status are crucial to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin are being administered to reduce the"

   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt has
   successfully made transition to pressure support 15/10, his pulmonary
   examination and radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is
   starting to show an improvement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage, Vancomycin was d/c
d several daqys ago [**3-5**] negative
   MRSA swabs. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis has increased off of
   Vancomycin. He clinically though does appear to be better,he has been
   able to tolerate less support from the ventilator and he has not been
   febrile. If pt does appear to decompensate or starts to desaturate, has
   worsening clinical exam or clinical data will have low threshold to
   restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will hold off on weaning today as pt is undergoing PEG placement
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Pt currently still sedated on Propofol gtt and Fentanyl
   gtt, goal of weaning will be to transition pt to trach mask and
   possible rehab. Will wean down sedation and use only Fentanyl boluses.
   - Wean sedation, D/c propofol, fentanyl  bolus only
   # Nutrition: Pt is to undergo PEG placement today, currently TF are
   off. Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   - PEG placement today
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr trending down to 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to be septic and intubated.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to immobility or pressure ulcers caused by prolonged bed rest.

2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has a history of anemia and has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to a low hemoglobin level. This could be caused by ongoing bleeding or blood loss.

3. Acidosis, metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can occur due to various reasons such as poor tissue perfusion, sepsis, or respiratory failure.

4. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, but there is no mention of shock. The cause of hypotension may be related to sepsis, fluid loss, or medication effects.

5. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient was initially suspected to have pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. His pulmonary examination and radiographic"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU.

The patient's medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension (not in shock), and community-acquired pneumonia. His pneumonia has been improving with the use of Levofloxacin and Zosyn, but there is still a low threshold to restart Vancomycin if the patient shows signs of deterioration.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal range except for a slightly low calcium level. Other lab results indicate acute kidney injury, but the creatinine level is trending down.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing with antibiotics, monitoring for any signs of deterioration or worsening clinical exam, and restarting Vancomycin if necessary. The patient's sedation will be weaned down, and he will be transitioned to a tracheostomy mask for possible rehabilitation. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is scheduled today due to the patient's inability to take oral feeds. The patient's albumin level is low"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, SCC of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the ED with symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He is currently septic and intubated. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and pressure support. His pneumonia is showing improvement, and he has been able to tolerate less support from the ventilator. He has been on Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage, and Vancomycin was discontinued as MRSA swabs were negative. The patient's leukocytosis has increased off of Vancomycin.

The patient's anemia is being monitored, and he received 2 units of PRBC due to a morning Hct of 15. His Hct is now stable at 30. Sedation is being weaned, and the goal is to transition the patient to a tracheostomy mask and possible rehab. The patient is undergoing PEG placement today, and his albumin level is low at 1.9.

The patient's Cr is trending down to 2.4, and the cause is pre-renal. The patient is euvolemic now, and there is a preference for slightly dry volume status given the goal of weaning to a tracheostomy mask.

 ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PNEUMONIA, BACTERIAL, COMMUNITY ACQUIRED (CAP)
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   #. Sepsis: On admission patient met SIRS criteria with tachycardia,
   temperature of 102, tachypnea and white blood count with bandemia. WBC
   have increased to trended down to 6.6. however he still has impressive
   bandemia. Likely source of SIRS is pneumonia.  Lactate initially noted
   to be 6.1, however following fluid administration is 1.9. Pt was
   started on Levofloxacin, Cefepime, Vancomycin in the ED. Zosyn IV was
   started for broad coverage, Levofloxacin for atypical coverage,
   Vancomycin for MRSA coverage given his h.o. of MRSA. Yesterday he
   became hypotensive and required pressure support again with Levophed as
   well as frequent IVF boluses. Today he has been able to wean off the
   levophed gtt.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, narrow spectrum if cultures turn
   positive
   - will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA screen negative
   - Sputum cx, bld cx pending. Legionella antigen negative, DFA for
   influenza pending.
   - Maintain MAP > 65, if pt requires vasopressor support will started
   levophed with vasopressin, will then attempt to wean off levophed and
   keep vasopressin for a 24 hour period. Will start pt on bolus of LR for
   IVF resuscitation.
   - Continue to trend WBC
   #. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis most
   likely related to his vast fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
   Following administration of 1L D5W with 3 amps of HCO3 pt
s CO2
   increased from 16 to 20. Will bolus IVF with LR and check PM lytes to
   monitor for hyperkalemia.
   - Support his BP as below to maintain pefusion to his kidneys.
   - IVF bolus with LR and monitor lytes for hyperkalemia.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.  As pt has had not decrease in Hct over the past
   few days, will restart Heparin for prophylaxis.
   - Active type and screen
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt started on ARDs
   protocol though he is taking in volume greater than 6cc/kg.  Urinary
   legionella negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin, will d/c Vancomycin as MRSA swab was
   negative
   - Sputum cultures, DFA negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will decrease FiO2 now and see how pt tolerates FiO2 of 40%. Will
   also aim to decrease PEEP from 12 to 8 with the goal of transitioning
   to trach mask with frequent suctioning of secretions.
   - Wean Versed and Fentanyl gtt as tolerated
   # Nutrition: Pt has been without nutrition, will consult nutrition
   regarding TF via NGT.
   - Nutrition consult for TF
   # New onset A-Fib: Pt noted to be in A-fib new onset in the ED which
   resolved once in the ICU.  He has been in sinus rhythm.
   - If A-fib recurs again at rate >100 consider starting digoxin vs
   amiodarone.
   - Monitor on tele
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr furthered increased to 3.0,
   baseline Creatinine noted to be 1.1-1.2.  Pt
s Creatinine with fluid
   resuscitation with urin output approx 50cc showed a decrease to 2.3,
   however overnight Creatinine increased back up to 3.0. Urine lytes have
   been ordered with a FENA suspicious for pre-renal. Will again
   administer IVF boluses with LR given the pt
s non-anion gap metabolic
   acidosis from NS fluid resuscitation for a goal of UOP >50cc/hr. Given
   low urine output [**Last Name (un) **] most likely [**3-5**] ATN versus pre-renal. Will
   continue to give fluid today and monitor UOP.
   - trend Cr
   -LR bolus
   # Nutrition: Pt currently has tube feeds via NG tube. Discussed with
   family who states that pt would want all measures of support. Pt
   unlikely to be taking PO [**3-5**] current clinical state. Will consult GI
   for a PEG placement for nutrition, will also obtain Albumin level.
   -Albumin level ordered
   -GI consult for PEG placement
   # Stoma: Pt currently has stoma, given his clinical picture he will
   likely require intubation for several days. ENT consulted yesterday for
   trach placement however were unable to place as another pt needed a
   STAT airway.
   - ENT placed trach size 7.0 yesterday

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous blood loss. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis and intubated.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has areas of impaired skin integrity, likely due to immobility and pressure from medical devices.
2. Anemia, acute secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding): The patient has a history of anemia, and his hematocrit levels indicate acute blood loss.
3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, possibly related to fluid resuscitation with normal saline.
4. Hypotension (not in shock): The patient experienced hypotension and required vasopressor support.
5. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has signs of pneumonia, and treatment has been initiated with antibiotics.
6. New onset atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation but resolved once in the ICU.
7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which may be pre-renal or due to acute tubular necrosis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This condition can worsen if not properly treated with antibiotics.

2. Sepsis: The patient is currently resolving from sepsis, which is a life-threatening response to infection. Close monitoring is necessary to prevent recurrence.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute renal failure due to factors such as distributive/hypovolemic shock and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Fluid management and monitoring urine output are crucial in managing this condition.

4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and blood products administration are required to maintain stable hemoglobin levels.

5. Large Bowel Obstruction: The patient previously had a large bowel obstruction, which has since resolved. Monitoring for any signs of recurrence or complications related to bowel function is important.

6. Malnutrition: The patient requires nutritional support due to malnutrition. A nutrition consult has been ordered, and the patient is scheduled for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and there is a risk of developing VAP. Prophylactic measures should be taken to minimize this risk.

   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt has
   successfully made transition to pressure support 15/10, his pulmonary
   examination and radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is
   starting to show an improvement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage, Vancomycin was d/c
d several daqys ago [**3-5**] negative
   MRSA swabs. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis has increased off of
   Vancomycin. He clinically though does appear to be better,he has been
   able to tolerate less support from the ventilator and he has not been
   febrile. If pt does appear to decompensate or starts to desaturate, has
   worsening clinical exam or clinical data will have low threshold to
   restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will hold off on weaning today as pt is undergoing PEG placement
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Pt currently still sedated on Propofol gtt and Fentanyl
   gtt, goal of weaning will be to transition pt to trach mask and
   possible rehab. Will wean down sedation and use only Fentanyl boluses.
   - Wean sedation, D/c propofol, fentanyl  bolus only
   # Nutrition: Pt is to undergo PEG placement today, currently TF are
   off. Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a complex medical history including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. The patient was diagnosed with sepsis and intubated. 

The patient has been experiencing hypertension, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and community-acquired pneumonia. The pneumonia was initially treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn, and Vancomycin was discontinued after negative MRSA swabs. 

The patient's leukocytosis improved after discontinuing Vancomycin, and his clinical condition has shown improvement. He is currently on pressure support 15/10 and is expected to undergo percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement today. 

The patient's blood work shows anemia, with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 30, which is being monitored. His kidney function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level. 

The patient's sedation will be weaned down, transitioning from propofol and fentanyl to only fentanyl boluses. He is also expected to have a PEG tube placed for nutrition.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to be septic and intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with severe pneumonia, which is showing improvement. He is currently receiving antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Zosyn) and his clinical condition appears to be better.

The patient also has hypertension, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, and community-acquired pneumonia. His leukocytosis has increased after stopping Vancomycin, but he does not seem to be clinically worse.

The patient's Hct level was artificially elevated due to hypovolemia/hemoconcentration, and he received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). His Hct level has stabilized at 30, and further monitoring is recommended.

The patient is still sedated on propofol and fentanyl, with the goal of transitioning him to a tracheostomy mask and possible rehabilitation. The plan is to wean down sedation and use only fentanyl boluses.

A percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement is planned for the patient today, as his total parenteral nutrition (TP"

   will screen for rehab today..
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt required a
   fentanyl bolus this AM but is very much interactive today.
   - Will transition from Fentanyl drip to patch
   # Nutrition: Pt has PEG placed yesterday, currently TF are off.
   Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   -          PEG received yesterday will restart feeds today as pt is 24
   hour post PEG placement
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 146, has
   slowly increased over the past few days and is most likely related to
   his poor intake. Pt
s free water deficit is 1.7L will add free H20
   bolus to tube feeds. Will continue to monitor.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr currently 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.
   -          trend Cr
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous surgeries including thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and creation of a stoma. He presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough, and was found to be septic and intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, acute anemia due to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, hypertension, altered nutrition, impaired skin integrity, and acute kidney injury. He has been placed on various medications including levofloxacin and zosyn for pneumonia treatment, and has undergone a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is currently being treated for community-acquired pneumonia with levofloxacin and zosyn. Monitoring for any worsening clinical exam, desaturation, or positive sputum/blood cultures is important to consider restarting vancomycin if necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his current hemoglobin level is stable at 30 after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Continued monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
3. Sedation: The goal"

   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS 15/10, his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is showing
   improvement.  A change in PEEP was delayed yesterday as pt was
   undergoing PEG tube placement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis increased
   intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He clinically
   though does appear to be better. If pt does appear to decompensate or
   starts to desaturate, has worsening clinical exam or clinical data will
   have low threshold to restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 14 days
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He is currently septic and intubated.

The patient underwent a PEG tube placement yesterday and experienced hypertension that required treatment with metoprolol and hydralazine. Propofol was discontinued, and his sedation is being weaned off.

His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/55 mmHg to 225/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation above 98%. He is on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals a slightly distended abdomen, normoactive bowel sounds, no facial grimacing upon palpation, and 3+ edema in both upper extremities. Neurological examination shows that the patient can open his eyes, communicate with his son, and flex his toes on command.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen level of 41 mg/dL, creat"

   septic and intubated.
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far negative to date. Pt has
   successfully made transition to pressure support 15/10, his pulmonary
   examination and radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is
   starting to show an improvement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage, Vancomycin was d/c
d several daqys ago [**3-5**] negative
   MRSA swabs. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis has increased off of
   Vancomycin. He clinically though does appear to be better,he has been
   able to tolerate less support from the ventilator and he has not been
   febrile. If pt does appear to decompensate or starts to desaturate, has
   worsening clinical exam or clinical data will have low threshold to
   restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Will hold off on weaning today as pt is undergoing PEG placement
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Pt currently still sedated on Propofol gtt and Fentanyl
   gtt, goal of weaning will be to transition pt to trach mask and
   possible rehab. Will wean down sedation and use only Fentanyl boluses.
   - Wean sedation, D/c propofol, fentanyl  bolus only
   # Nutrition: Pt is to undergo PEG placement today, currently TF are
   off. Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   - PEG placement today
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr trending down to 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a complex medical history, including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous surgeries. The patient presented to the emergency department with symptoms of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to be septic and intubated.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications:

1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been consistently high, requiring monitoring and management.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's albumin level is low, indicating malnutrition or impaired nutritional status.
3. Impaired skin integrity: There is no specific information provided regarding the impaired skin integrity, but it may be related to the patient's overall condition or pressure ulcers.
4. Anemia, acute: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating acute anemia, likely secondary to blood loss during surgery or other causes.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's blood gases indicate metabolic acidosis, which could be due to several factors such as lactic acidosis, renal dysfunction, or sepsis.
6. Hypotension: Despite being hypertensive at times, the patient has episodes of hypotension, which may be related to his overall condition or fluid balance.
7. Pneumonia, bacterial, community-acquired (CAP): The patient has severe pneumonia, likely"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU with community-acquired pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, and malnutrition. The patient underwent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement yesterday. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, sedatives, and analgesics. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 161/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. Physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, edema in both lower extremities, and scrotal edema. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, low albumin, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable. The patient's conditions include pneumonia, sepsis, acute renal failure, anemia, and malnutrition. The plan is to continue weaning off sedation, minimize ventilator support, start tube feeds, and optimize glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is resolving slowly with evidence of necrosis on chest X-ray. There is a risk of worsening or developing complications such as abscess formation"

   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS 15/10, his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is showing
   improvement.  A change in PEEP was delayed yesterday as pt was
   undergoing PEG tube placement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis increased
   intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He clinically
   though does appear to be better. If pt does appear to decompensate or
   starts to desaturate, has worsening clinical exam or clinical data will
   have low threshold to restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8, will attempt to gently wean to
   PEEP of 5 this PM if pt is comfortable. Pt is close to rehab placement,
   will screen for rehab today..
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt required a
   fentanyl bolus this AM but is very much interactive today.
   - Will transition from Fentanyl drip to patch
   # Nutrition: Pt has PEG placed yesterday, currently TF are off.
   Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   -          PEG received yesterday will restart feeds today as pt is 24
   hour post PEG placement
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 146, has
   slowly increased over the past few days and is most likely related to
   his poor intake. Pt
s free water deficit is 1.7L will add free H20
   bolus to tube feeds. Will continue to monitor.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr currently 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.
   -          trend Cr
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. He was found to be septic and intubated. The patient has severe pneumonia showing improvement, leukocytosis that is now trending down, and has responded well to antibiotics. He is being weaned off sedation and is interactive. The patient has anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, impaired skin integrity, and hypernatremia. He is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placed for nutrition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: Despite improvement, there is still a risk of worsening or recurrence of pneumonia due to the patient's immunocompromised state and respiratory support.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which may require further transfusion support or intervention.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can lead to organ dysfunction if not corrected.
4. Hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension, which needs to be managed and monitored closely.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, particularly in the scrotal area, which increases the risk"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone here with resolved sepsis s/p PEG
   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS [**1-8**], his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is improving.  His
   PEEP was weaned down yesterday to 8 (from 10). He is currently on
   Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis
   increased intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He
   clinically though does appear to be better. Sputum cultures, blood
   cultures all have been negative, DFA negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days (today is his
   last day for antibiotic treatment).
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8, will attempt to gently wean to
   PEEP of 5 this PM if pt is comfortable. Pt is close to rehab placement,
   will screen for rehab today.
   # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will continue to hold off starting anticoagulation given his bleeding
   risk and recent hematoma.
   # Rectus sheath hematoma: Patient likely developed secondary to SQH
   shots.  SQH has been dc
ed.  Hct has been stable.
   - Will follow daily Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - Will hold a family meeting tomorrow to reassess goals of care given
   the new findings.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. Hct is stable at 27.7 (from 29.3).
   - Continue to monitor daily Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt was weaned
   down to 35 mg/hr yesterday and started on a fentanyl patch.
   - Will continue the fentanyl patch and try to turn off the gtt today.
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 147
   (stable from yesterday).
   - Will increase the free water flushes in his tube feeds to 250 cc q3h
   (from q4h).
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing to 1.8 (from 2.0).  UOP 30-50
   cc/h.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He underwent thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently requiring ventilatory support in the ICU.

24-hour events:
1. Left upper extremity (LUE) showed complete occlusive thrombus surrounding the left percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line in the left brachial and axillary veins. A second thrombus was noted in another brachial vein. The PICC line was removed, and a right femoral line was placed instead. The patient also had right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, and a computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large rectus hematoma measuring 12 cm craniocaudal x 6.5 cm transverse x 2.8 cm anterior-posterior. New lesions within the liver, suspicious for metastasis, were also observed.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia that is improving. He is saturating >90% on positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8, down from 10. He is currently on Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. The patient's leukoc"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an elderly male with a complex medical history including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and previous sepsis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and requires ventilatory support.

The patient's recent events include the development of occlusive thrombus surrounding the left PICC line in the left brachial and axillary veins, as well as a thrombus within a second left brachial vein. The PICC line was removed, and the patient is now on anticoagulation therapy.

Additionally, the patient has a large rectus hematoma, which was discovered after experiencing right lower quadrant pain. New lesions within the liver are suspicious for metastasis.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 147/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.4 K/uL, elevated hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.4 mg/dL, and low albumin level of 1.9 g/dL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly elevated sodium level of 146 mEq/L"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone here with resolved sepsis s/p PEG
   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS [**1-8**], his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is improving.  His
   PEEP was weaned down yesterday to 8 (from 10). He is currently on
   Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis
   increased intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He
   clinically though does appear to be better.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8, will attempt to gently wean to
   PEEP of 5 this PM if pt is comfortable. Pt is close to rehab placement,
   will screen for rehab today..
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt required a
   fentanyl bolus this AM but is very much interactive today.
   - Will transition from Fentanyl drip to patch
   # Nutrition: Pt has PEG placed yesterday, currently TF are off.
   Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   -          PEG received yesterday will restart feeds today as pt is 24
   hour post PEG placement
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 146, has
   slowly increased over the past few days and is most likely related to
   his poor intake. Pt
s free water deficit is 1.7L will add free H20
   bolus to tube feeds. Will continue to monitor.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr currently 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.
   -          trend Cr
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a complex medical history, including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and a recent percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for ventilatory support. The patient's recent events include the development of occlusive thrombus in the left PICC line, inability to place a subclavian line, and the discovery of a large rectus hematoma and new liver lesions suspicious for metastasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia that is improving, but still requires continued antibiotic coverage with Levofloxacin and Zosyn for a total of 10 days. Close monitoring of the patient's pulmonary examination and radiographical data is necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his Hct has been stable at 30 following a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Continuous monitoring of the patient's Hct is recommended.
3. Sedation: The goal is to wean the patient off Fentanyl so that he can be awake enough to transition to a tracheostomy mask and possibly rehabilitation. Transitioning from a Fentanyl drip to a patch will be attempted.
4. Nutrition: The patient has a PEG tube placed yesterday, and enteral feeding will be restarted today as the patient is 24"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone presenting to the ED with 2day history
   of fevers, chills, fatigue, poor PO intake and non-productive cough now
   septic and intubated.
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS 15/10, his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is showing
   improvement.  A change in PEEP was delayed yesterday as pt was
   undergoing PEG tube placement. He is currently on Levofloxacin and
   Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis increased
   intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He clinically
   though does appear to be better. If pt does appear to decompensate or
   starts to desaturate, has worsening clinical exam or clinical data will
   have low threshold to restart Vancomycin.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days
   - Sputum cultures, blood cultures thus far negative pending finals, DFA
   negative
   - Follow bcx as above
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8, will attempt to gently wean to
   PEEP of 5 this PM if pt is comfortable. Pt is close to rehab placement,
   will screen for rehab today..
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. On admission Hct 24 likely artificially elevated [**3-5**]
   hypovolemia/hemoconcentration. Pt received 2units PRBC following a
   morning Hct of 15. Currently his Hct has been stable now at 30, will
   continue to monitor.
   - Continue to monitor Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt required a
   fentanyl bolus this AM but is very much interactive today.
   - Will transition from Fentanyl drip to patch
   # Nutrition: Pt has PEG placed yesterday, currently TF are off.
   Nutrtition are following pt currently, his albumin is low 1.9.
   -          PEG received yesterday will restart feeds today as pt is 24
   hour post PEG placement
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 146, has
   slowly increased over the past few days and is most likely related to
   his poor intake. Pt
s free water deficit is 1.7L will add free H20
   bolus to tube feeds. Will continue to monitor.
   # Acute Kidney Injury: The patient
s Cr currently 2.4, cause is
   pre-renal. Will not fluid bolus at this time as his urine output is
   increasing, pt is euvolemic now and preference for volume status would
   be slightly dry given goal of wean to trach mask.
   -          trend Cr
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He presented to the emergency department with fevers, chills, fatigue, poor oral intake, and non-productive cough. The patient is currently septic and intubated.

Medical Complications:

1. Occlusive thrombus: The patient has an occlusive thrombus surrounding the left percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line in the left brachial and axillary veins. There is also a thrombus in a second left brachial vein. This could lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), or peripheral thrombophlebitis.

2. Rectus hematoma: The patient has a large rectus hematoma measuring 12 cm craniocaudal x 6.5 cm transverse x 2.8 cm anterior-posterior. This could potentially cause pain, bleeding, or pressure effects on surrounding structures.

3. Liver lesions: The patient has new lesions within the liver that are suspicious for metastasis. This indicates the progression of his prostate cancer and may require further evaluation and treatment.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient is slightly hypernatremic with a sodium level of 146. This could be due to poor intake and dehydration. It needs to be corrected to prevent complications such as"

   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS [**1-8**], his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is improving.  His
   PEEP was weaned down yesterday to 8 (from 10). He is currently on
   Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis
   increased intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He
   clinically though does appear to be better. Sputum cultures, blood
   cultures all have been negative, DFA negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days (today is his
   last day for antibiotic treatment).
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8 yesterday, unable to wean to 5
   secondary to agitation. Pt is close to rehab placement, continue
   screening process
   - will send another sputum as sputum is slightly blood tinged this
   morning
   # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will continue to hold off starting anticoagulation given his bleeding
   risk and recent hematoma.
   # Rectus sheath hematoma: Patient likely developed secondary to SQH
   shots.  SQH has been dc
ed.  Hct has been stable.
   - Will follow daily Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting held this morning and advised that CPR would not be
   medically indicated which family understood, they would, however, want
   him to be shocked if he were to code
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. Hct is 25.5 (29-
27 yesterday).
   - check pm hct, transfuse if <21
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt was weaned
   down to 35 mg/hr yesterday and started on a fentanyl patch.
   - Will continue the fentanyl patch and try to turn off the gtt today
   - patient also with significant anasarca which may be inihibiting
   weaning him
 will give lasix 20mg iv x1 with goal UOP (-)1-1.5L

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone here with resolved sepsis s/p PEG
   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS [**1-8**], his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is improving.  His
   PEEP was weaned down yesterday to 8 (from 10). He is currently on
   Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis
   increased intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He
   clinically though does appear to be better. Sputum cultures, blood
   cultures all have been negative, DFA negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days (today is his
   last day for antibiotic treatment).
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8, will attempt to gently wean to
   PEEP of 5 this PM if pt is comfortable. Pt is close to rehab placement,
   will screen for rehab today.
   # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will continue to hold off starting anticoagulation given his bleeding
   risk and recent hematoma.
   # Rectus sheath hematoma: Patient likely developed secondary to SQH
   shots.  SQH has been dc
ed.  Hct has been stable.
   - Will follow daily Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - Will hold a family meeting tomorrow to reassess goals of care given
   the new findings.
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. Hct is stable at 27.7 (from 29.3).
   - Continue to monitor daily Hct
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt was weaned
   down to 35 mg/hr yesterday and started on a fentanyl patch.
   - Will continue the fentanyl patch and try to turn off the gtt today.
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic today 147
   (stable from yesterday).
   - Will increase the free water flushes in his tube feeds to 250 cc q3h
   (from q4h).
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing to 1.8 (from 2.0).  UOP 30-50
   cc/h.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone a thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The patient is currently on ventilatory support in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia that is improving. He is being treated with Levofloxacin and Zosyn. His leukocytosis is increasing intermittently but trending back down. Sputum cultures, blood cultures, and DFA are negative.
2. Upper extremity thrombus: The patient has an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site.
3. Rectus sheath hematoma: The patient likely developed a secondary hematoma due to subcutaneous heparin shots. Subcutaneous heparin has been discontinued, and Hct will be followed daily. Pneumoboots will be used for prophylaxis.
4. New liver masses seen on CT: The patient has a history of three malignancies and widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer. New masses seen on CT likely represent metastases. A family meeting will be held to reassess"

   cultures all have been negative, DFA negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days (today is his
   last day for antibiotic treatment).
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8 yesterday, unable to wean to 5
   secondary to agitation. Pt is close to rehab placement, continue
   screening process
   - will send another sputum as sputum is slightly blood tinged this
   morning
   # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will continue to hold off starting anticoagulation given his bleeding
   risk and recent hematoma.
   # Rectus sheath hematoma: Patient likely developed secondary to SQH
   shots.  SQH has been dc
ed.  Hct has been stable.
   - Will follow daily Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting held this morning and advised that CPR would not be
   medically indicated which family understood, they would, however, want
   him to be shocked if he were to code
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. Hct is 25.5 (29-
27 yesterday).
   - check pm hct, transfuse if <21
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt was weaned
   down to 35 mg/hr yesterday and started on a fentanyl patch.
   - Will continue the fentanyl patch and try to turn off the gtt today
   - patient also with significant anasarca which may be inihibiting
   weaning him
 will give lasix 20mg iv x1 with goal UOP (-)1-1.5L
   # Hypernatremia: Pt noted to be slightly hypernatremic yesterday at
   147, now normalized to 142 with increase of free water boluses
   yesterday
   - daily lytes
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing to 1.6 (from 2.0).  UOP 30-50
   cc/h.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname **] has not had signs of overt bleeding but heparin has been
   withheld given concerns of rectus sheath hematoma and recent UGI
   oozing. He has completed a course of IV antibiotics for nosocmial PNA.
   He remains on CPAP and PSV support today with FiO2 near 50%. He
   continues to manifest anasarca and tenderness in RLQ.
   Exam notable for Tm of 98.2 BP of 144/56 HR of 65 RR of 18 with sat on
   PSV/CPAP [**11-8**] cms.
   Agree with plan to attempt diuresis today and recheck sputum GS, C&S.
   he is at high risk for bleeding and anticoagulation will be withheld
   until PICC/ Midline placed in RUE.
   I have had a long discussion today ( nearly 30 minutes) with the aid of
   translator with his son to discuss ongoing medical issues and recent
   CT/ USG findings. I have told him that we will continue full supportive
   care short of CPR in the event of a septic hemodynamic decline, as that
   would be futile therapy. The orders will reflect that ( i.e CPR not
   indicated).
   I am hopeful that we will be able to transition off PEEP and current
   CPAP settings with diuresis if he does not have another infectious
   complication. He remains frail with progressive metastatic disease and
   family is aware of this too
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone a thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently on ventilatory support and requires assistance for nutrition and hydration.

The patient has several medical complications including pneumonia, a rectus sheath hematoma, occlusive thrombus in the PICC line, hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, and scrotal edema. He also has a history of anemia.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with antibiotics and the PEEP has been weaned down to 8. A sputum culture will be sent.
2. Upper extremity thrombus: The PICC line has been removed due to an occlusive thrombus. Anticoagulation is not recommended due to the patient's recent rectus hematoma and bleeding risk.
3. Rectus sheath hematoma: The patient likely developed this condition secondary to subcutaneous heparin injections. The use of pneumoboots for prophylaxis is planned.
4. New liver masses: The patient has a history of three malignancies and widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer. The new masses seen on CT are likely"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone multiple surgeries and treatments, including a thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has severe pneumonia that is improving, but there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of the infection.
2. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has developed an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line, indicating a potential risk for DVT. Anticoagulation has been withheld due to the patient's recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site.
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of anemia, and his hematocrit (Hct) levels have been decreasing. Close monitoring and potential transfusion may be necessary.
4. Sedation: The patient is heavily sedated and requires weaning off fentanyl to facilitate transition to tracheostomy mask and possible rehabilitation.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient was previously hypernatremic, but has been normalized with free water boluses. Daily electrolyte monitoring is recommended.

   # Pneumonia: Culture data has been negative to date. He has completed a
   10day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Pt
s clinical examination is
   improving. CPAP 15/8, pt still has pleural effusions. To improve
   pleural effusions will keep pt slightly dry, aiming for a 24hour I/O
   goal of -500cc to -1l. Pt
s leukocytosis is currently improving will
   continue to trend
   - f/u last Sputum gram stain and culture
   - I/O 24hr goal of -500 to -1 litre
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will put in request for Rt midline placement
   - Will d/c central line once midline is placed
   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct decreased yesterday to 23 with an increase to 29
   following 1 unit of transfusion. Pt  shows no increase in stool output
   so it is highly unlikely given the Hct drop that the pt has a GI bld
   that explains it. Given his current BPS a retroperitoneal bleed is also
   unlikely. Given the large increase in Hct, yesterday
s Hct may be a
   combination of lab error and dilution as pt is still volume overloaded.
   Will trend a PM Hct to ensure pt is not bleeding further, if Hct
   continues to drop will likely need abdominal imaging to check for RP
   bleed.  Will hold off on anticoagulation with Heparin SQ.
   - Will follow 5pm Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting held this morning and advised that CPR would not be
   medically indicated which family understood, they would, however, want
   him to be shocked if he were to code
   # Sedation: Pt is currently weaned off of Fentanyl gtt and on Fentanyl
   patch which has been on for several days. If pt becomes agitated will
   try Haldol PRN, if agitation still occurs will give Fentayl boluses
   only.
   - Continue Fentanyl patch
   - consider Haldol PRN if pt becomes agitated
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing ranging 1.6-1.7 (from an
   admission  of 3.0).  Pt
s UOP responded to Furosemide dose, will
   continue to trend. Pt
s kidney fucntion improving as he is recovering
   from ATN versus pre-renal state.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

   Disposition: [**Hospital **] rehab placement
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with multiple comorbidities including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, resolved sepsis, and pneumonia. He is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 153/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. His temperature is within normal range.

The patient has a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), acute respiratory failure, hypertension, alteration in nutrition, impaired skin integrity, anemia secondary to blood loss, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury. He also has new liver masses seen on CT scan, which are likely representing metastases from his known malignancies.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating, with a recent decrease to 23% that improved to 29% after receiving a blood transfusion. There is concern for possible gastrointestinal bleeding or retroperitoneal bleed, but further imaging may be required to confirm.

The patient's sedation plan involves using a Fentanyl patch and weaning off the gtt form. If agitation occurs, Haldol PRN may be considered. The"

   # Pneumonia: Culture data thus far still negative to date. Pt
   saturating >90% on PS [**1-8**], his pulmonary examination and
   radiographical data show a severe pneumonia that is improving.  His
   PEEP was weaned down yesterday to 8 (from 10). He is currently on
   Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage. Interestingly, pt
s leukocytosis
   increased intermittently but now is starting to trend back down. He
   clinically though does appear to be better. Sputum cultures, blood
   cultures all have been negative, DFA negative.
   - Continue Zosyn, Levofloxacin for a total of 10 days (today is his
   last day for antibiotic treatment).
   - Pt successfully weaned to a PEEP of 8 yesterday, unable to wean to 5
   secondary to agitation. Pt is close to rehab placement, continue
   screening process
   - will send another sputum as sputum is slightly blood tinged this
   morning
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC yesterday and is no s/p PICC removal.
   Anticoagulation was not started given his recent rectus hematoma and
   bleeding around his central line site.
   - Will continue to hold off starting anticoagulation given his bleeding
   risk and recent hematoma.
   # Rectus sheath hematoma: Patient likely developed secondary to SQH
   shots.  SQH has been dc
ed.  Hct has been stable.
   - Will follow daily Hct.
   - Use pneumoboots for ppx
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting held this morning and advised that CPR would not be
   medically indicated which family understood, they would, however, want
   him to be shocked if he were to code
   # Anemia: Pt has a history of Anemia prior Hcts late last year show
   approx 23. Hct is 25.5 (29-
27 yesterday).
   - check pm hct, transfuse if <21
   # Sedation: Goal is to wean pt off Fentanyl so pt is awake enough to
   ultimately transition to trach mask and possible rehab. Pt was weaned
   down to 35 mg/hr yesterday and started on a fentanyl patch.
   - Will continue the fentanyl patch and try to turn off the gtt today
   - patient also with significant anasarca which may be inihibiting
   weaning him

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He is currently in the ICU requiring ventilatory support.

Summary of the patient's health progress:
- The patient's family had a meeting to discuss code status due to the likely progression of metastatic disease. They understand that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would not be medically indicated but would like him to be shocked if he were to code.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been trending down from 30.1% to 29%, and he received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) overnight, resulting in an increase to 29% this morning.
- The patient received Lasix 20mg IV last night and again this morning to promote diuresis.
- The patient's pneumonia is improving, with saturation >90% on PSV, and PEEP was weaned down to 8 from 10 yesterday. He is currently on Levofloxacin and Zosyn for coverage.
- The patient's leukocytosis has intermittently increased but is now trending back down, indicating improvement.
- Sputum cultures, blood cultures, and DFA have all been negative.
- The patient was unable to be weaned to a PEEP of 5 due to agitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone here with resolved sepsis s/p PEG
   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data has been negative to date. He has completed a
   10day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Pt
s clinical examination is
   improving. CPAP 15/8, pt still has pleural effusions. To improve
   pleural effusions will keep pt slightly dry, aiming for a 24hour I/O
   goal of -500cc to -1l. Pt
s leukocytosis is currently improving will
   continue to trend.  Last sputum cx was no growth.
   - Patient was only 200 cc negative yesterday.  Continue to diureses
   with I/O 24hr goal of -500 to -1 L with prn IV lasix.  Can also further
   decrease the free water flushes as his Na has been stable (had been
   previously increased due to hypernateremia).
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC and is s/p PICC removal.  Anticoagulation was
   not started given his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his
   central line site.
   - Request is in for Rt midline placement
   - Will d/c central line once midline is placed
   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct decreased two days ago to 23 with an increase to 29
   following 1 unit of transfusion. Pt shows no increase in stool output
   so it is highly unlikely given the Hct drop that the pt has a GI bld
   that explains it. Given his current BPS a retroperitoneal bleed is also
   unlikely. Given the large increase in Hct, yesterday
s Hct may be a
   combination of lab error and dilution as pt is still volume
   overloaded.  Hct last night and today are stable at 26.5
 27.3)
   - Hct continues to drop will likely need abdominal imaging to check for
   RP bleed.
   - Will hold off on anticoagulation with Heparin SQ and use pneumoboots
   for ppx.
   - Trend daily Hct.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting recently held and during which the family were advised
   that CPR would not be medically indicated which family understood, they
   would, however, want him to be shocked if he were to code
   # Sedation: Pt is currently weaned off  the Fentanyl gtt and on
   Fentanyl patch which has been on for several days. If pt becomes
   agitated will try Haldol PRN, if agitation still occurs will give
   Fentayl boluses only.
   - Continue Fentanyl patch
   - consider Haldol PRN if pt becomes agitated
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing and at 1.5 (from an admission
   of 3.0).  Pt
s UOP responded to Furosemide dose, will continue to
   trend. Pt
s kidney fucntion improving as he is recovering from ATN
   versus pre-renal state.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Scrotal Edema: Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no skin breakdown
   noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state likely [**3-5**]
   decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status. With tube
   feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

1. The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

2. The patient is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support due to SCC of the larynx. He has completed a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn for pneumonia, and his clinical examination is improving.

3. The patient has pleural effusions, and his 24-hour fluid output goal is set at -500 to -1 L to improve the effusions. He is being diuresed with intravenous Lasix as needed.

4. The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and his last sputum culture showed no growth.

5. The patient had an occlusive thrombus around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and has undergone PICC removal. Anticoagulation was not initiated due to recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site. A request is in for a right midline placement, and the central line will be disconnected once the midline is placed.

s leukocytosis is currently improving will
   continue to trend.  Last sputum cx was no growth.
   - I/O 24hr goal of -500 to -1 L with prn IV lasix
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC and is s/p PICC removal.  Anticoagulation was
   not started given his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his
   central line site.

   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct decreased two days ago to 23 with an increase to 29
   following 1 unit of transfusion. Pt shows no increase in stool output
   so it is highly unlikely given the Hct drop that the pt has a GI bld
   that explains it. Given his current BPS a retroperitoneal bleed is also
   unlikely. Given the large increase in Hct, yesterday

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a complex medical history including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU for ventilatory support and has several ongoing medical issues.

1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn, and his clinical examination is improving. He is still on CPAP at a pressure of 15/8, but still has pleural effusions. The goal is to improve pleural effusions by keeping the patient slightly dry, aiming for a 24-hour urine output goal of -500cc to -1L. The patient's leukocytosis is currently improving, and the last sputum culture was negative.

2. Upper extremity thrombus: The patient had an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line and has undergone PICC removal. Anticoagulation was not started due to recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around the central line site. A request is in for a right midline placement, and the central line will be discontinued once the midline is placed.

3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) decreased two days ago to 23 and increased to 29 following one unit of transfusion. The patient shows no increase in stool output, making it unlikely that there is gastrointestinal bleeding causing the H"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone thyroidectomy, total laryngectomy, and modified radical neck dissection. He also has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement and is currently on ventilatory support. 

The patient's current condition includes pneumonia, which has been treated with a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. His clinical examination is improving, but he still has pleural effusions. 

He was found to have an occlusive thrombus around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which has been removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around the central line site. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased to 23 and then increased to 29 after receiving a blood transfusion. This may be a lab error or dilution, but further investigation is needed as the Hct continues to drop.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 y.o. Male w/ papillary thyroid CA s/p thyroidectomy with radioactive
   iodine ablation, SCC of the larynx s/p total laryngectomy w/ modified
   radical neck dissection with stoma, metastatic prostate cancer with
   metastatic lesions to the bone here with resolved sepsis s/p PEG
   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data has been negative to date. He has completed a
   10day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Pt
s clinical examination is
   improving. CPAP 15/8, pt still has pleural effusions. As the patient is
   stabilizing and may have post ATN diuresis, will aim to keep his I/O
   even. Pt
s leukocytosis is currently improving will continue to trend.
   Last sputum cx was no growth.
   - Patient was 200 cc negative yesterday.  Continue to aim for even I/0,
   using prn lasix as needed.  Can also further decrease the free water
   flushes as his Na has been stable (had been previously increased due to
   hypernateremia).
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC and is s/p PICC removal.  Anticoagulation was
   not started given his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his
   central line site.
   - Request is in for Rt midline placement
   - Will d/c central line once midline is placed
   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct decreased two days ago to 23 with an increase to 29
   following 1 unit of transfusion. Pt shows no increase in stool output
   so it is highly unlikely given the Hct drop that the pt has a GI bld
   that explains it. Given his current BPS a retroperitoneal bleed is also
   unlikely. Given the large increase in Hct, yesterday
s Hct may be a
   combination of lab error and dilution as pt is still volume
   overloaded.  Hct last night and today are stable at 26.5
 27.3)
   - Hct continues to drop will likely need abdominal imaging to check for
   RP bleed.
   - Will hold off on anticoagulation with Heparin SQ and use pneumoboots
   for ppx.
   - Trend daily Hct.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting recently held and during which the family were advised
   that CPR would not be medically indicated which family understood
   # Sedation: Pt is currently weaned off  the Fentanyl gtt and on
   Fentanyl patch which has been on for several days. If pt becomes
   agitated will try Haldol PRN, if agitation still occurs will give
   Fentayl boluses only.
   - Continue Fentanyl patch
   - consider Haldol PRN if pt becomes agitated
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing and at 1.5 (from an admission
   of 3.0).  Pt
s kidney function improving as he is recovering from
   likely ATN.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue amlodipine and metoprolol.
   # Scrotal Edema: Improving.  Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no
   skin breakdown noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state
   likely [**3-5**] decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status.
   With tube feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia, but the clinical examination is improving. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening respiratory symptoms or positive culture results.

2. Pleural effusions: The patient still has pleural effusions despite being on CPAP support. This could indicate ongoing fluid accumulation in the lungs and should be addressed with appropriate interventions.

3. Thrombus in PICC line: The patient was found to have an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line, which was subsequently removed. Anticoagulation therapy should be considered to prevent further clot formation.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels have been fluctuating, with a recent decrease to 23 and an increase to 29 following a blood transfusion. This suggests ongoing blood loss or dilutional anemia. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, such as GI bleeding or retroperitoneal bleed.

5. New liver masses: The patient has new liver masses seen on CT, which are likely representing metastases from his known malignancies. This indicates progression of disease and potential complications related to liver function.

6. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels have improved from an admission level of 3.0 to 1.5. It is crucial to continue monitoring kidney function and adjust fluid management"

   placement continuing to require ventilatory support..
   # Pneumonia: Culture data has been negative to date. He has completed a
   10day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Pt
s clinical examination is
   improving. CPAP 15/8, pt still has pleural effusions. As the patient is
   stabilizing and may have post ATN diuresis, will aim to keep his I/O
   even. Pt
s leukocytosis is currently improving will continue to trend.
   Last sputum cx was no growth.
   - Patient was 200 cc negative yesterday.  Continue to aim for even I/0,
   using prn lasix as needed.  Can also further decrease the free water
   flushes as his Na has been stable (had been previously increased due to
   hypernateremia).
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC and is s/p PICC removal.  Anticoagulation was
   not started given his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his
   central line site.
   - Request is in for Rt midline placement
   - Will d/c central line once midline is placed
   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct decreased two days ago to 23 with an increase to 29
   following 1 unit of transfusion. Pt shows no increase in stool output
   so it is highly unlikely given the Hct drop that the pt has a GI bld
   that explains it. Given his current BPS a retroperitoneal bleed is also
   unlikely. Given the large increase in Hct, yesterday
s Hct may be a
   combination of lab error and dilution as pt is still volume
   overloaded.  Hct last night and today are stable at 26.5
 27.3)
   - Hct continues to drop will likely need abdominal imaging to check for
   RP bleed.
   - Will hold off on anticoagulation with Heparin SQ and use pneumoboots
   for ppx.
   - Trend daily Hct.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting recently held and during which the family were advised
   that CPR would not be medically indicated which family understood
   # Sedation: Pt is currently weaned off  the Fentanyl gtt and on
   Fentanyl patch which has been on for several days. If pt becomes
   agitated will try Haldol PRN, if agitation still occurs will give
   Fentayl boluses only.
   - Continue Fentanyl patch
   - consider Haldol PRN if pt becomes agitated
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing and at 1.5 (from an admission
   of 3.0).  Pt
s kidney function improving as he is recovering from
   likely ATN.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue amlodipine and metoprolol.
   # Scrotal Edema: Improving.  Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no
   skin breakdown noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state
   likely [**3-5**] decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status.
   With tube feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone several surgeries and treatments, including thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently in the ICU requiring ventilatory support.

The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia, upper extremity thrombus, anemia, new liver masses seen on CT scan, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and scrotal edema. The pneumonia is improving with negative culture data and completion of a 10-day course of antibiotics. The patient's leukocytosis is improving as well.

The upper extremity thrombus was found around the patient's PICC line, which has been removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to the patient's recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around the central line site. A request has been made for a right midline placement, and the central line will be discontinued once it is in place.

The patient's Hct has decreased, but increased after a blood transfusion. The cause of the Hct drop is still being investigated, and imaging may be necessary to check for retroperitoneal bleeding.

New liver masses seen on CT scan are likely representing metastases from the patient's history of three malignancies"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone several surgeries and treatments, including thyroidectomy, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and radioactive iodine ablation. The patient also has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition.

The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure and requires ventilatory support. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, but culture data has been negative. He has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics, and his clinical examination is improving. He is still on CPAP at a pressure of 15/8 and has pleural effusions.

The patient also has an upper extremity thrombus around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line and has had the PICC line removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site.

The patient has anemia, with a decreasing hemoglobin concentration (Hct) that improved after a blood transfusion. His Hct is currently 24.9, down from 27.3. The anemia may be dilutional, especially since his last Hct increased from 23 to 29 following only one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, metastatic prostate cancer, and resolved sepsis. He is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, for which he has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics. His clinical examination is improving, but he still has pleural effusions. He also has leukocytosis, which is currently improving.

The patient was found to have an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line and subsequently had the PICC line removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site. A midline was placed in his right arm.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) decreased from 29 to 24.9 after receiving a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The Hct decrease may be due to dilutional effects, especially since his last Hct had increased from 23 to 29 following only 1 unit of PRBC transfusion. The patient is hemodynamically stable and does not suspect an abdominal or rectal bleed. The Hct decrease may also be attributed to anemia of chronic disease or chronic kidney disease.

New liver masses were seen on CT scan, likely representing metastases from the patient's known malignancies. The patient's family was informed"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone several surgeries including thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient also has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer.

The patient was admitted to the ICU with sepsis and required ventilatory support. He has since improved clinically and completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia. However, he still has pleural effusions.

The patient was found to have an occlusive thrombus around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which has been removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site. A midline has been placed.

The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating, and he received a blood transfusion. However, his Hct levels continue to decrease. It is suspected that this may be due to dilutional effects, especially since his last Hct level increased after a blood transfusion. The patient's anemia may also be related to his history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding from hemorrhoids.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone various surgeries and treatments, including thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently in the ICU requiring ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. He has multiple medical complications, including pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), anemia, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, and scrotal edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics for pneumonia, and his clinical examination is improving. However, the presence of pleural effusions may indicate unresolved infection or complications.
2. DVT: The patient has an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line, which has been removed. Anticoagulation was not initiated due to recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around the central line site. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing, possibly due to dilutional effects from blood transfusions or ongoing blood loss. Further evaluation and transfusion for a goal hemoglobin level >25% may be necessary.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a history of metabolic acidosis,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a complex medical history including papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ventilatory support.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory status: The patient has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and is showing improvement. However, he still has pleural effusions.
2. Upper extremity thrombus: The patient had an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line, which was removed. Anticoagulation is not recommended due to the risk of bleeding.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been stable at 26.0, indicating no clinical evidence of bleeding.
4. New liver masses seen on CT: The patient has a history of multiple malignancies and widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer. These new masses on CT are likely representing metastases.
5. Sedation: The patient is currently weaned off fentanyl gtt and on a fentanyl patch. If agitation occurs, Haldol PRN will be considered, followed by fentanyl boluses if necessary.
6. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are decreasing, indicating improving kidney function after likely acute tubular necrosis.
7. Hypertension: The patient continues to be on amlodipine and metoprolol.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He underwent a thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. He has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics and is showing improvement. The patient also has occlusive thrombus around his PICC line, which was removed, and he is not receiving anticoagulation due to recent bleeding complications. His hemoglobin level is stable, and he is receiving iron supplements. There are new liver masses seen on CT scan, likely representing metastases from his prostate cancer. The patient's family has been informed that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would not be medically indicated. The patient is being weaned off sedation and is on a Fentanyl patch. He has improving kidney function and is receiving medications for hypertension, hypothyroidism, and scrotal edema. The patient's nutrition is being provided through tube feeds."

   # Pneumonia/Respiratory status: Culture data has been negative to date.
   He has completed a 10day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn. Pt
   clinical examination is improving. CPAP [**11-8**], pt still has pleural
   effusions. Pt
s leukocytosis is currently improving will continue to
   trend.  Last sputum cx was no growth.
   - Improved now s/p 10 day course of Zosyn and Levofloxacin
   - Continue lasix 40 mg [**Hospital1 **] for a goal diuresis of 500 cc to 1 L
   negative as he is still 19.6 L positive for LOS.
   - Continue atrovent nebs and albuterol prn
    # Upper extremity thrombus: Patient was found to have occlusive
   thrombus around his PICC and is s/p PICC removal.  Anticoagulation was
   not started given his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his
   central line site.  Rt mid line placed on the left.
   -  No anticoagulation given risk for bleeding.
   # Anemia: Pt
s Hct has been stable at 26.0 today.
   - Repeat Hct at noon and transfuse for Hct >25
   - Trend daily Hct.
   # New liver masses seen on CT:  The patient has a history of 3
   malignancies and has widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate
   cancer now with new masses seen on CT likely representing metastases.
   - family meeting recently held and during which the family were advised
   that CPR would not be medically indicated which family understood
   # Sedation: Pt is currently weaned off  the Fentanyl gtt and on
   Fentanyl patch which has been on for several days. If pt becomes
   agitated will try Haldol PRN, if agitation still occurs will give
   Fentayl boluses only.
   - Continue Fentanyl patch
   - consider Haldol PRN if pt becomes agitated
   - Trazadone prn for insomnia
   # Acute Kidney Injury: Cr now decreasing and at 1.3 (from an admission
   of 3.0).  Pt
s kidney function improving as he is recovering from
   likely ATN.
   - Continue to trend Cr.
   # Hypertension:
   - Continue amlodipine and metoprolol.
   # Scrotal Edema: Improving.  Pt noted have severe scrotal edema, no
   skin breakdown noted. Will elevate scrotum with sling, edematous state
   likely [**3-5**] decreased oncotic pressures [**3-5**] poor nutritional status.
   With tube feeds nutrition should slowly improve.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. The patient has undergone multiple surgeries and treatments including a thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. The patient is currently in the ICU requiring ventilatory support.

The patient's medical conditions include pneumonia/respiratory status, upper extremity thrombus, anemia, new liver masses, sedation, acute kidney injury, hypertension, and scrotal edema. The patient has completed a 10-day course of Levofloxacin and Zosyn for pneumonia and is showing improvement in clinical examination. The patient also has an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line and has undergone removal of the PICC line. Anticoagulation was not started due to the patient's recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site.

The patient's Hct has been stable at 26.0, indicating no significant change in anemia. New liver masses seen on CT are likely representing metastases from the patient's history of three malignancies and widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer. The family has been advised that cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) would not be medically indicated.

The patient's kidney function is improving, as indicated by"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. The patient has several comorbidities, including liver metastasis, acute renal failure, rectus sheath hematoma, and DVT. The patient's condition has been complicated by the development of necrosis in the lungs, likely due to the pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 146/63 mmHg, heart rate of 71 bpm, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 301 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count ranging from 10.5 to 16.4 thousand/mm3, anemia with hemoglobin levels between 8.7 and 12.7 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts between 140 and 391 thousand/mm3. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, diuretics, and others.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a diagnosis of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP). The patient has been receiving antibiotics and respiratory support, specifically CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 301 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's respiratory syncytial biopsy (RSBI) is 162, indicating a low risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's cardiovascular system is stable with normal heart sounds (S1 and S2) and peripheral pulses. However, breath sounds are diminished on the left side compared to the right. The abdomen is non-tender, soft, and distended. Extremities show bilateral edema. Neurological examination is not assessed.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.7 K/uL and a decrease in hemoglobin (Hct) from 30.2% to 24.9%. Platelet count (Plt) is within normal range, but creatinine (Cr) levels are slightly elevated. Blood glucose levels are well-controlled. Other lab values, including liver function tests, electrolytes, and kidney function, are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone a thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and has a permanent tracheostomy. The patient also has widespread bony metastases from prostate cancer and has had resolved sepsis with a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. He is currently in the ICU requiring ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/Respiratory Status: The patient has been on CPAP and still has pleural effusions. He has completed a course of antibiotics but may still be at risk for pneumonia due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Upper Extremity Thrombus: The patient had an occlusive thrombus around his PICC line and it was removed. He is not receiving anticoagulation due to recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around the central line site.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been stable at 25.2 today, indicating no active bleeding. However, his anemia needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
4. New Liver Masses: The patient has new masses seen on CT, which are likely representing metastases given his history of multiple malignancies and widespread bony metastatic disease from prostate cancer."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of papillary thyroid cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, and metastatic prostate cancer. He has undergone several surgeries and treatments including thyroidectomy with radioactive iodine ablation, total laryngectomy with modified radical neck dissection, and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for ventilatory support due to pneumonia. He has completed a 10-day course of antibiotics (Levofloxacin and Zosyn) and his clinical examination is improving. However, he still has pleural effusions and his leukocytosis is currently improving.

The patient also has a history of an occlusive thrombus around his peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line, which has been removed. Anticoagulation was not started due to his recent rectus hematoma and bleeding around his central line site.

Other medical issues mentioned in the note include anemia, new liver masses seen on CT scan (likely representing metastases), acute kidney injury (with improving kidney function), hypertension, hypothyroidism, and scrotal edema.

The patient's current medications include Fentanyl patch for pain management, Haloperidol (Haldol) for agitation, trazodone for insomnia, amlodipine and metoprolol for hypertension, and le"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and multiple comorbidities. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and anticoagulants. He has shown improvement in his respiratory status but continues to have ongoing issues related to his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and culture results will be important to prevent and treat this complication.

2. deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT, which can be exacerbated by immobility and central venous catheters. Regular lower extremity assessments and consideration for prophylactic anticoagulation may be necessary to prevent the development or progression of DVT.

3. liver metastases: The patient has a history of liver metastases, which may contribute to hepatic dysfunction and impact his overall prognosis. Close monitoring of liver enzymes and imaging studies will be important to evaluate the progression of this condition.

4. acute renal failure: The patient had an episode of acute renal failure, which has since resolved. However, it is essential to continue monitoring renal function to ensure early detection of any subsequent renal issues.

5. rectus sheath hematoma: The patient has a rectus sheath hematoma, which may require supportive management. Regular assessment for"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP). The patient has been in the ICU since 02/17/2164. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 124/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.29, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 45 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 88 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP): The patient has been diagnosed with CAP and is currently being treated with antibiotics. However, the pneumonia seems to be resolving slowly with evidence of necrosis on chest X-ray. Close monitoring and adjustment of the antibiotic regimen may be necessary.
2. Rectus sheath hematoma: The patient has a rectus sheath hematoma that requires supportive management"
