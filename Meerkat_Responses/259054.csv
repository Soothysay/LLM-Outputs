   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now trasnferred to MICU for GIB.
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids.  She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP to keep INR < 2
   - EGD today
   - q 4-6 hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - NPO for now
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   No need for para today.  MELD today is 28 today, but was recently 42.
   Currently undergoing liver transplant eval and hopes to be put on the
   list in the upcoming days.
   - hold nadolol
   - continue lactulose & rifaximin
   - ceftriaxone for SBP ppx in settin gof GI bleed
   - continue vitamin K daily
   - hold diuretics
   .
   3.  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 1.2 today with albumin and
   holding diuretics.  There was concern for AIN secondary to ?midodrine
   versus cipro.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - blood transfusions for colloid rather than albumin
   .
   4.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   5.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   6.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  Though
   there is concern for possible DVT, could not get anticoagulated given
   elevated INR and GIB.
   - RLE LENI
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, NPO tonight
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, and the bleeding source was identified as bleeding hemorrhoids during anoscopy. She has received octreotide therapy for variceal bleeding, proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and blood transfusions to maintain hematocrit (Hct) above 30%. Her INR has been managed with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion. The patient's past medical history includes ascites, encephalopathy, and liver transplant evaluation. She also has a history of ARF, which has improved with albumin and holding diuretics. Other conditions include exfoliative dermatitis, pulmonary hypertension, and right lower extremity edema.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's current condition is GIB, which can lead to hypovolemia and shock if not managed properly.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis and encephalopathy, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, especially with the current bleeding and fluid resuscitation.
3. Renal failure: Although the patient's ARF has improved, there is still a risk of renal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presented with a gastrointestinal bleed. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed and showed no active bleeding, but bleeding hemorrhoids were identified. An anoscopy was then performed by surgery, resulting in the placement of sutures and staples with some improvement but not complete resolution of the bleeding. An anal pack was left in place.

The patient received a significant amount of blood products, including 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and 1 unit of cryoprecipitate. The patient was also intubated due to the anticipation of large volume resuscitation and had a right cordis placed.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient received ceftriaxone at 11:40 PM on 08/28/2125. The patient is currently on infusions of octreotide at 25 mcg/hour, fentanyl (concentrate) at 100 mcg/hour, and midazolam (versed) at 2 mg/hour.

In terms of vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, with a maximum recorded temperature of 36.7 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit). The patient's blood pressure is stable, ranging from 127/70 mmHg to 157/86 mmHg. The heart rate is also stable, ranging"

   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and Hct is stabilizid.  Also s/p 6 units of FFP.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP to keep INR < 2
   - q 4-6 hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - NPO for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - hold nadolol
   - hold lactulose & rifaximin due to lack of po access
   - ceftriaxone for SBP ppx in settin gof GI bleed
   - continue vitamin K daily
   - hold diuretics
   - discuss with GI re: saftey of NGT placement
   .
   3.  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.9  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.  There was concern for AIN
   secondary to ?midodrine versus cipro.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - blood transfusions for colloid rather than albumin
   .
   4.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis. She was initially admitted for acute renal failure, which has improved with albumin and holding diuretics. She is now in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely due to bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement and packing, resulting in some improvement of bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her hematocrit (Hct) is stabilizing. She also received 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and sedated. 

Her laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 8.6 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL, platelet count of 86 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, total bilirubin of 2.4 mg/dL, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.7. 

The patient's medical history includes alcoholic cirrhosis, acute renal failure, esophageal varices, and antral ulcer. She"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing, which improved the bleeding. She received 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has stabilized, but she continues to bleed. The patient's history includes esophageal varices and antral ulcer, and an EGD showed no evidence of bleeding. Octreotide and PPI have been initiated for therapy of variceal bleed. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

Potential medical complications:
1. GIB: The patient is experiencing ongoing bleeding despite interventions, which can lead to further hemodynamic instability and potential organ failure.
2. Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient's cirrhosis is complicated by ascites and encephalopathy. This condition may progress and lead to hepatic failure or liver transplant requirements.
3. ARF: The patient's renal function has improved"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and Hct is stabilizid.  Also s/p 6 units of FFP.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP to keep INR < 2
   - q 4-6 hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - NPO for now
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - hold nadolol
   - continue lactulose & rifaximin
   - ceftriaxone for SBP ppx in settin gof GI bleed
   - continue vitamin K daily
   - hold diuretics
   - discuss with GI re: saftey of NGT placement
   .
   3.  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.9  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.  There was concern for AIN
   secondary to ?midodrine versus cipro.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - blood transfusions for colloid rather than albumin
   .
   4.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   5.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   6.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  Though
   there is concern for possible DVT, could not get anticoagulated given
   elevated INR and GIB.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, which are risk factors for GIB. 

The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) that showed no evidence of bleeding, but a colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. An anoscopy was performed by surgery with suture placement followed by packing, which improved the bleeding. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 85 beats per minute, blood pressure of 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. 

Laboratory results show a hematocrit (Hct) level of 33.1%, which has improved from previous measurements. The platelet count is slightly low at 86,000/mm3, but other blood counts are within normal limits. Liver function tests and electrolytes are also within normal ranges.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The summary of the note is as follows:

The patient presented with a gastrointestinal bleed and required resuscitation with blood products. The source of bleeding was identified as internal hemorrhoids with active bleeding. The patient underwent elective intubation due to massive blood loss and is currently on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's history reveals a background of EtOH cirrhosis, which may have contributed to the development of portal hypertension and subsequent complications such as varices and hemorrhoids. The patient is currently being evaluated for a possible liver transplant.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure within normal range and an oxygen saturation level of 100%. However, there is evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by an elevated central venous pressure and peripheral edema.

Laboratory results show a decrease in hemoglobin levels, likely due to the ongoing blood loss. There is also evidence of coagulopathy, with elevated prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as a low platelet count. Renal function tests indicate acute kidney injury, possibly secondary to hypoperfusion during the massive blood loss episode.

Imaging studies reveal a collapsed left lung due to the endotracheal tube placement, but this has improved since then.

The assessment and plan include the following:

   2. Acute respiratory failure
   3. EtOH cirrhosis
   63 yo female with EtOH cirrhosis, admitted initially with  renal
   failure which improved with colloids, also drug
related rash.
   Was undergoing transplant eval, when  yesterday she developed GI
   bleed/acute blood loss anemia
   *GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Lower GI bleed due to hemorrhoids by
   colonoscopy. Has evidence of diffuse varices also, though these were
   not actively bleeding by
scope yesterday
   received 8 units blood and 7 units ffp,
   -Rectal packing removed this morning by surgery- will monitor for
   worsening bleeding. They may try to further contain locally by balloon
   tamponade
   -Serial hct
   - transfuse as needed for Hct< 30, or more frequently as needed
   dependent  on rapidity of bleeding and hemodynamic status
   - Transplant surgery continuing to follow- may do further packing
   - If unable to control bleeding locally, may require  surgery
   (proctectomy, colectomy). However, as pt has multiple possible sites
   for active bleeding, this may not address the underlying issue. TIPS
   would reduce portal pressures, but also risky due to increased
   likelihood of hepatic encephalopathy. Management decision will depend
   on whether she starts to re-bleed, and how easily this can be
   contained. Liver and transplant team continue to follow closely.
   *EtOH cirrhosis:
   -CTX started for SBP prophylaxis in the setting of GI bleed
   -Diuretics held due to GI bleed
   - No urgent need for paracentesis
   -Clarify transplant status with liver team
   -Off lactulose for the time being as pt unable to take po, and OGT or
   NGT placement would run the risk of triggering local trauma/variceal
   bleed.
   *Acute respiratory failure: intubated electively due to massive
   resuscitation
   -Adequate oxygenation and ventilation on current settings
   - Continue mechanical ventilation as pt remains at high risk for
   massive bleed due to varices, hemorrhoids and high portal pressures
   Acute renal failure: had resolved prior to MICU transfer. Continue to
   trend
   Pulm HTN secondary to LV overload: no active intervention given pt

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis. She was admitted initially with renal failure, which improved with colloids, and a drug-related rash. She is currently undergoing a transplant evaluation. The patient developed a lower gastrointestinal bleed due to hemorrhoids, as confirmed by colonoscopy. She also has evidence of diffuse varices, although they were not actively bleeding. The patient received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma for the bleed. Rectal packing was removed this morning by surgery, and the patient will be monitored for worsening bleeding. Further containment measures, such as balloon tamponade, may be attempted. The patient's hematocrit levels will be monitored, and she will be transfused as needed for a hematocrit level below 30 or more frequently depending on the rapidity of bleeding and hemodynamic status. Transplant surgery will continue to follow the patient and may perform further packing. If the bleeding cannot be controlled locally, surgery (proctectomy, colectomy) may be required. However, this may not address the underlying issue as the patient has multiple possible sites for active bleeding. The decision to proceed with liver transplantation will depend on whether the patient starts to re-bleed and how easily the bleeding can be contained. The patient is also at risk for hepatic encephalopathy due to increased likelihood. Diuretics have been held due to the GI bleed,"

   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and Hct is stabilizid.  Also s/p 6 units of FFP.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - FFP to keep INR < 2
   - q 4-6 hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - NPO for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - hold nadolol
   - hold lactulose & rifaximin due to lack of po access
   - ceftriaxone for SBP ppx in settin gof GI bleed
   - continue vitamin K daily
   - hold diuretics
   - discuss with GI re: saftey of NGT placement
   .
   3.  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.9  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.  There was concern for AIN
   secondary to ?midodrine versus cipro.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   - blood transfusions for colloid rather than albumin
   .
   4.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   5.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   6.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  Though
   there is concern for possible DVT, could not get anticoagulated given
   elevated INR and GIB.
   - RLE LENI (preliminiarliy negative)
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer. The patient underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing, which improved the bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient is being treated with IV octreotide for variceal bleeding, IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI), transfusion to maintain hemoglobin concentration (Hct) above 30, FFP to keep INR below 2, and regular monitoring of Hct and INR. The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with complications such as ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. She is undergoing liver transplant evaluation and hopes to be placed on the transplant list soon. The patient also has a history of ARF, which has improved with albumin and holding diuretics. There was concern for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) secondary to midodrine versus ciprofloxacin. The patient has exfoliative dermatitis, which is resolving, and pulmonary hypertension, likely related to fluid overload.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 24 hours
   and Hct stabilized.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.
   - hold nadolol
   - resume lactulose & rifaximin once extubate and able to take Pos, if
   unable to extubate, will ask GI with assistance to place NGT
   - d/c ceftriaxone in setting of rising eonophilia and drug rash on
   abdomen
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed
   - aztreonam to cover SBP ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate and low grade fever.  Will broaden abx to
   vanco/aztreonam to cover PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol
   if needed for sedation.  She may have component of hepatic
   encephalopathy which is unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold all sedatives
   - PS trial if responding to commands
   - if does not awaken without sedation; will need NGT for lactulose
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  The rising eosinophilia, low grade fever and abd
   rash is suggestive of drug rash to ?ceftriaxone.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.6  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  Fevers.  Possibilities include VAP (LLL infiltrate on CXR), drug
   fever (?ceftriaxone), SBP.
   - d/c ceftriaxone given concern for drug rash
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcohol (EtOH) cirrhosis, admitted for renal failure and drug-related rash. She underwent pre-transplant evaluation. The patient developed gastrointestinal (GI) bleed/acute blood loss anemia due to hemorrhoids, as confirmed by colonoscopy. She also has evidence of diffuse varices, although they were not actively bleeding during the scope examination. The patient received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), as well as 2 units of cryoprecipitate (cryo). Rectal packing was removed yesterday, and the patient will be monitored for worsening bleeding. If the bleeding cannot be controlled locally, surgical intervention, such as proctectomy or colectomy, may be required. However, this may not address the underlying issue if there are multiple sites of active bleeding. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) could reduce portal pressures but carries the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. The management decision will depend on whether the patient starts to re-bleed and how easily this can be contained. The liver and transplant team will continue to follow the patient closely.

Additionally, the patient has a fever, which may be due to possible cellulitis or a lung infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures have been obtained. Diuretics have been"

   GI bleed from hemorrhoids with acute blood loss anemia. Her hct
s have
   remained unchanged over the past day with no obvious recurrent
   bleeding. She continues to have acute respiratory failure predominantly
   related to excessive sedation, though low-grade temperatures also
   developed with concerns for an evolving VAP. Continuous sedative
   infusions have been stopped and will continue to monitor neurological
   status closely.  Will also proceed with therapeutic paracentesis. Once

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted to the ICU for renal failure and drug-related rash. She underwent a pre-transplant evaluation when she developed a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed/acute blood loss anemia due to hemorrhoids. She received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), as well as 2 units of cryoprecipitate. The rectal packing was removed by surgery, and she is being monitored for worsening bleeding. Serial hematocrit (Hct) measurements will be obtained, and she will be transfused as needed for Hct <30 or more frequently based on the rapidity of bleeding and hemodynamic status. The liver and transplant team are closely following her case, considering further packing or surgery if needed.

She also has a fever, which is thought to be caused by possible cellulitis or a lung infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin and cefepime, and cultures have been obtained. EtOH cirrhosis management has been adjusted due to the GI bleed, including holding diuretics and clarifying transplant status with the liver team. Lactulose has been temporarily stopped due to the inability to take oral medications without triggering local trauma/variceal bleed.

The patient was intubated electively due to massive resuscitation and is currently on mechanical ventilation. This will"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with EtOH cirrhosis (undergoing pretransplant eval),
   admitted initially with  renal failure which improved with colloids,
   also drug
related rash. Was undergoing transplant eval, when
   yesterday she developed GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia. Stable
   following endoscopy showing hemorrhoids
   GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Lower GI bleed due to hemorrhoids by
   colonoscopy. Has evidence of diffuse varices also, though these were
   not actively bleeding by
scope yesterday
   -received 8 units blood and 7 units ffp, 2u cryo
   -Rectal packing removed yest by surgery- will monitor for worsening
   bleeding. They may try to further contain locally by balloon tamponade
   -Serial hct
   - transfuse as needed for Hct< 30, or more frequently as needed
   dependent  on rapidity of bleeding and hemodynamic status
   - Transplant surgery continuing to follow- may do further packing
   - If unable to control bleeding locally, may require  surgery
   (proctectomy, colectomy). However, as pt has multiple possible sites
   for active bleeding, this may not address the underlying issue. TIPS
   would reduce portal pressures, but also risky due to increased
   likelihood of hepatic encephalopathy. Management decision will depend
   on whether she starts to re-bleed, and how easily this can be
   contained. Liver and transplant team continue to follow closely.
   Fever: low grade overnight; sources include possible cellulitis, lung
   (infiltrate on CXR)
   -broaden ABX to vanco + cefepime
   -pan-culture, consider repeat paracent
   EtOH cirrhosis:
   -Diuretics held due to GI bleed
   -Clarify transplant status with liver team
   -Off lactulose for the time being as pt unable to take po, and OGT or
   NGT placement would run the risk of triggering local trauma/variceal
   bleed.
   Acute respiratory failure: intubated electively due to massive
   resuscitation. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation on current settings
   -Continue mechanical ventilation as pt remains at high risk for massive
   bleed due to varices, hemorrhoids and high portal pressures
   -Paracentesis prior to extubation
   -PSV trial today
   Acute renal failure: had resolved prior to MICU transfer. Continue to
   trend
   Pulm HTN secondary to LV overload: no active intervention given pt

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 24 hours
   and Hct stabilized.
   - IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.
   - hold nadolol
   - resume lactulose & rifaximin once extubate and able to take Pos, if
   unable to extubate, will ask GI with assistance to place NGT
   - d/c ceftriaxone in setting of rising eonophilia and drug rash on
   abdomen
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed
   - aztreonam to cover SBP ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   3.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate and low grade fever.  Will broaden abx to
   vanco/aztreonam to cover PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol
   if needed for sedation.  She may have component of hepatic
   encephalopathy which is unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold all sedatives
   - PS trial if responding to commands
   - if does not awaken without sedation; will need NGT for lactulose
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  The rising eosinophilia, low grade fever and abd
   rash is suggestive of drug rash to ?ceftriaxone.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.6  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  Fevers.  Possibilities include VAP (LLL infiltrate on CXR), drug
   fever (?ceftriaxone), SBP.
   - d/c ceftriaxone given concern for drug rash
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to hemorrhoids. She underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing, resulting in some improvement of bleeding. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) stabilized. 

The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, but an EGD showed no evidence of bleeding. The colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. She is on IV octreotide for therapy of variceal bleed, IV pantoprazole (Protonix), and will be transfused to keep Hct >30. Fibrinogen levels are low, and there is concern for rebleeding. 

The patient's MELD score is high at 42, indicating severe liver disease. She is undergoing liver transplant evaluation and hopes to be listed soon. Her lack of lactulose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI bleed. 

The patient is also intubated for airway protection and has developed a left lower lobe infiltrate and low-grade fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin/aztreonam) have been started to cover pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was admitted on 08/19/2125 for acute renal failure (ARF). She is currently in the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) suspected to be from hemorrhoids. The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no evidence of bleeding, but a colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement followed by packing, which resulted in some improvement of bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 125/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute (inspiratory), and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2 via endotracheal tube. The patient is intubated for airway protection and has a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.0 g"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 48 hours
   .  Hct slightly trending downward yesterday.
    - IV octreotide stopped today per hepatology
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 24 hours.
   Remains unresponsive likely due to poor hepatic clearance +/-  hepatic
   encephalopthy.
   - disucss with liver re: NGT placement for lactulose
   - will avoid rectal lactulose so that the hemorroid bleeding does not
   recur
   - will remain off all sedation
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.  Para yesterday [**2125-8-30**] showed no SBP.
   - hold nadolol; consider resuming in the future if remains
   hemodynamically stable
   - NGT placement by EGD so that lactulose/refaximin can be given
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed, but consider resuming when stable
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate and low grade fever.  Will broaden abx to
   vanco/aztreonam to cover PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol
   if needed for sedation.  She may have component of hepatic
   encephalopathy which is unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold all sedatives
   - PS trial if responding to commands
   - NGT placement by surgery for lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.6  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever yesterday [**8-30**].  Possibilities include
   VAP (LLL infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was
   negative for SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP and to cover SBP ppx in setting of GI bleed
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  Patient needs PO access to resume tube feeds.  Will discuss
   NGT placement by GI today.
   .
   Code: full, confirmed with patient, ICU consent signed

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, which could have caused the gastrointestinal bleeding. She underwent anoscopy and packing with some improvement in bleeding. However, her hemoglobin concentration is still trending downward, indicating ongoing or re-bleeding.

2. Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis with ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. She is undergoing liver transplant evaluation and hopes to be put on the transplant list soon. The lack of lactulose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI bleed.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for airway protection and now has a left lower lobe infiltrate and low-grade fever. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and aztreonam) have been initiated to cover potential pneumonia. Sedation has been held off, and propofol will be used if needed for sedation.

4. Eosinophilia: The patient has an elevated eosinophil count, likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash. The antibiotic ceftriaxone has been discontinued.

5. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's renal function has improved from a creatinine level of 4.0 to 0.6 today with albumin and holding diure"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis undergoing pretransplant evaluation. She was initially admitted for renal failure, which improved with colloids, and also presented with a drug-related rash. The patient developed gastrointestinal bleeding/acute blood loss anemia due to hemorrhoids, as confirmed by colonoscopy. She received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma, as well as rectal packing removal. The patient is currently being monitored for worsening bleeding and may undergo further packing if necessary. Serial hematocrit measurements will be taken, and she will be transfused as needed to maintain a hemoglobin level above 30. Transplant surgery will continue to follow up on her condition and may perform additional packing if needed. The patient's EtOH cirrhosis requires diuretic hold due to GI bleed. Clarification of the transplant status with the liver team is necessary.

The patient's obtundation is multifactorial, with factors including being off medications for encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding exacerbating the condition, and prior use of Versed for sedation. Sedatives should be avoided, and lactulose should be temporarily stopped since the patient is unable to take oral medications. The patient's acute respiratory failure required elective intubation due to massive resuscitation. She is currently adequately oxygenated and ventilated on her current settings. A trial of pressure support ventilation (PSV) will be conducted today"

   I was physically present with the resident team on this date for
   discussion of the above history, exam and assessment and plan with
   which I agree.  I independently examined the patient and would add the
   following comments: 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis undergoing
   transplant w/u, transferred to MICU [**8-28**] for GI bleed/acute blood loss
   anemia from hemorrhoids requiring massive resuscitation- bleeding
   apparently ceased following local suture/stapling/packing by surgery.
   Major issues include:
   1. Acute respiratory failure: intubated electively for massive
   resuscitation. Marginal mental status the major barrier to extubation.
   Off sedatives since yesterday, will continue to monitor neurological
   status. Once more [**Month/Year (2) **] will attempt SBT+ extubation. If agitation
   develops before she is [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] temporize with propofol.
   2. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Has not required transfusions
   yesterday or today. Octeotride stopped today, remains on IV PPI
   3. EtOH cirrhosis: nadolol and diuretics held. Intent was initially for
   pt to be extubated quickly and take po lactulose, but she has been slow
   to wake up. Will talk to liver team re: NG or OGT placement for
   lactulose.
   4. Low grade fevers: Possible VAP on CXR, now on Vanc/Aztreonam. Will
   re-adjust depending on recovery of micro data within the next 24-48
   hours.
   Pt is critically ill. Total time spent: 40 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 618**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2125-8-31**] 20:06 ------
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis undergoing a pre-transplant evaluation. She was admitted initially for renal failure and later developed a drug-related rash. The patient then experienced acute blood loss anemia due to a lower gastrointestinal bleed caused by hemorrhoids. She received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma, and her rectal packing was removed. 

The patient is critically ill with several major issues:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was electively intubated due to massive resuscitation. Her marginal mental status is a barrier to extubation. She is off sedatives, and her neurological status will be continuously monitored. Another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation attempt will be made. If agitation develops before that, propofol will be used temporarily.
2. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: The patient has not required transfusions recently. Octreotide has been stopped, and she remains on IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
3. EtOH cirrhosis: Diuretics have been held, and the plan is to clarify the transplant status with the liver team.
4. Low-grade fevers: Possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) on chest X-ray, now on vancomycin and aztreonam. The antibiotic regimen will be adjusted based on the recovery of microbiology data within the next 24-48 hours.

The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of these critical issues."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 48 hours
   .  Hct slightly trending downward yesterday.
    - IV octreotide stopped today per hepatology
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 24 hours.
   Remains unresponsive likely due to poor hepatic clearance +/-  hepatic
   encephalopthy.
   - disucss with liver re: NGT placement for lactulose
   - will avoid rectal lactulose so that the hemorroid bleeding does not
   recur
   - will remain off all sedation
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.  Para yesterday [**2125-8-30**] showed no SBP.
   - hold nadolol; consider resuming in the future if remains
   hemodynamically stable
   - NGT placement by EGD so that lactulose/refaximin can be given
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed, but consider resuming when stable
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate and low grade fever.  Will broaden abx to
   vanco/aztreonam to cover PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol
   if needed for sedation.  She may have component of hepatic
   encephalopathy which is unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold all sedatives
   - PS trial if responding to commands
   - NGT placement by surgery for lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.6  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever yesterday [**8-30**].  Possibilities include
   VAP (LLL infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was
   negative for SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP and to cover SBP ppx in setting of GI bleed
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  Patient needs PO access to resume tube feeds.  Will discuss
   NGT placement by GI today.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - monitoring for signs of bleeding in setting of resuming tube feeds
   today
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  AMS likely due to poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives +/-  hepatic encephalopthy.
   - d/c propofol after NGTplacement by GI
   - resume lactulose/rifaximin once NGT placed
   - propofol for now until ready to extubate
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.  Para yesterday [**2125-8-30**] showed no SBP.
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - NGT placement by EGD so that lactulose/refaximin can be given
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed, but consider resuming when stable
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Will broaden abx to vanco/aztreonam to cover
   PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol until ready to
   extubate.  She may have component of hepatic encephalopathy which is
   unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold fent/versed and use propofol for sedation until ready to
   extubate
   - NGT placement by GI  for lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back..
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever [**8-30**].  Possibilities include VAP (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was negative for
   SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP and to cover SBP ppx in setting of GI bleed
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  Patient needs PO access to resume tube feeds.  NGT
   placement by GI today.
   .
   Code: full, confirmed with patient, ICU consent signed

","Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and is currently in the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent an anoscopy with suture placement and packing for bleeding hemorrhoids, received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has been trending upward without any transfusions.

The patient's sedation was managed with propofol initially but was temporarily stopped for nasal-gastric tube (NGT) placement. The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 350 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 23.

The patient's laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.4. Electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for low potassium.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, right-sided crackles in both lungs, distended abdomen with soft and non-tender bowel sounds, and bilateral pitting edema.

Assessment and plan:
1. GIB - The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer. Colonoscopy"

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis of the liver, alcoholic, and altered mental status. He was admitted to the ICU for fluid volume overload and required intubation due to airway protection issues. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, slightly low hemoglobin level of 11.7 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 56 mg/dL, and slightly low sodium level of 130 mEq/L. The creatinine level is elevated at 1.2 mg/dL, indicative of renal dysfunction. Other lab results are mostly within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the peripheral vascular system or neurologic assessment. However, the skin examination is not assessed. 

The patient's medical problems include altered mental status, fluid volume overload, cirrhosis of the liver, impaired"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 48 hours
   .  Hct slightly trending downward yesterday.
    - IV octreotide stopped today per hepatology
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - type and cross 4 units
   - hold nadolol for now
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - strict bowel rest
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 24 hours.
   Remains unresponsive likely due to poor hepatic clearance +/-  hepatic
   encephalopthy.
   - disucss with liver re: NGT placement for lactulose
   - will avoid rectal lactulose so that the hemorroid bleeding does not
   recur
   - will remain off all sedation
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.  Para yesterday [**2125-8-30**] showed no SBP.
   - hold nadolol; consider resuming in the future if remains
   hemodynamically stable
   - NGT placement by EGD so that lactulose/refaximin can be given
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed, but consider resuming when stable
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate and low grade fever.  Will broaden abx to
   vanco/aztreonam to cover PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol
   if needed for sedation.  She may have component of hepatic
   encephalopathy which is unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold all sedatives
   - PS trial if responding to commands
   - NGT placement by surgery for lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.6  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever yesterday [**8-30**].  Possibilities include
   VAP (LLL infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was
   negative for SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP and to cover SBP ppx in setting of GI bleed
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  Patient needs PO access to resume tube feeds.  Will discuss
   NGT placement by GI today.
   .
   Code: full, confirmed with patient, ICU consent signed
   .
   Communication: Patient

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing for bleeding hemorrhoids, received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is slightly trending downward, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate transfusion.

The patient remains sedated off all sedation for 24 hours, likely due to poor hepatic clearance and/or hepatic encephalopathy. There are plans to discuss with the liver team regarding nasogastric tube (NGT) placement for lactulose administration to manage hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, and although an EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, a colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient's MELD score is high at 42, indicating significant liver dysfunction.

The patient is also being evaluated for liver transplant and hopes to be placed on the transplant list in the upcoming days. Due to the lack of PO access, the patient may develop encephalopathy due to the GI bleed.

The patient has an LLL infiltrate on chest X-ray and a low-grade fever, raising concerns"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old alcoholic cirrhotic who was admitted to the ICU for rectal bleeding. The patient is not listed for transplant and was intubated due to the anticipation of a large-volume resuscitation. An anoscopy was performed, and the patient is currently stable after receiving 8 units of blood.

The patient has had difficulty waking up from sedation but began to wake up overnight. The hematocrit (Hct) level is stable and trending up, and no blood products have been given in the past two days.

The patient is awaiting a post-pyloric feeding tube placement by the GI team. They are currently on acetaminophen (AC) overnight to rest and receive propofol. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin and aztreonam at 12:00 AM.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure of 138/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the development of agitation overnight. The flow sheet data shows stable hemodynamics, fluid balance, and respiratory support.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old alcoholic cirrhotic who was transferred to the ICU for rectal bleeding. They were intubated due to a large volume of resuscitation anticipated and underwent anoscopy, which stabilized their condition. However, the patient experienced difficulty waking up from sedation and began to wake up overnight. Their hematocrit (Hct) is stable and trending up, with no blood products administered in the past two days.

The patient's medical history includes EtOH cirrhosis, renal failure, and a drug-related rash. They are undergoing a pre-transplant evaluation. The patient developed a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed due to hemorrhoids, as confirmed by colonoscopy. They received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), as well as 2 units of cryoprecipitate. Rectal packing was removed three days ago, and they will be monitored for worsening bleeding. Balloon tamponade may be used locally to further contain the bleeding. Serial hematocrit measurements will be taken, and the patient will be transfused as needed for a hematocrit level below 30 or more frequently based on bleeding and hemodynamic stability.

The patient also has hypernatremia, likely due to lack of oral access. A post-pyloric feeding tube will be placed by the GI team. The patient's EtOH cirrhosis requires diuretics to be held, and nadal"

   Assessment and Plan
   63 yo female with EtOH cirrhosis (undergoing pretransplant eval),
   admitted initially with  renal failure which improved with colloids,
   also drug
related rash. Was undergoing transplant eval, when she
   developed GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia. Stable following endoscopy
   showing hemorrhoids
   1. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: Lower GI bleed due to hemorrhoids
   by colonoscopy. Has evidence of diffuse varices also, though these were
   not actively bleeding by EGD on this admission
   -received 8 units blood and 7 units ffp, 2u cryo
   -Rectal packing removed 3d ago by surgery- will monitor for worsening
   bleeding. They may try to further contain locally by balloon tamponade
   -Serial hct
   -transfuse as needed for Hct< 30, or more frequently as needed
   dependent  bleeding and hemodynamic stability
   -Transplant surgery continuing to follow; no further packing necessary
   given cessation of bleeding
   2. Hypernatremia
 no PO access at this time, GI to place post pyloric
   dobhoff. D5W by IV
   3. Fevers [**8-30**], LLL infiltrate: low grade yesterday; no clear source
   identified but treating for presumed VAP
   -broaden ABX to vanco + aztreonam; drug reaction to CTX may be
   responsible for fevers
   -narrow or dc in next 24h if no evidence of infxn
   4. EtOH cirrhosis:
   -Diuretics held due to GI bleed
 restart nadalol today; hold on
   lactulose for now, until dobhoff in place
 plan to restart diuretics
   tomorrow if hemodynamically stable overnight
   -Clarify transplant status with liver team
   5. Obtundation: multifactorial, off meds for encephalopathy, GIB
   exacerbating, prior Versed for sedation
 woke up briefly yesterday
   -no sedatives
   -Off lactulose for the time being as pt unable to take po. GI to assist
   w/ placing feeding tube today
   6. Acute respiratory failure: intubated electively due to massive
   resuscitation. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
   support. After dobhoff in place, will turn off prop and wean to
   extubate today or tomorrow if mental status is adequate.
   7. Acute renal failure: had resolved prior to MICU transfer. Continue

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old alcoholic with a history of cirrhosis, currently admitted to the ICU for rectal bleeding. The patient has undergone an anoscopy and was found to be stable after receiving 8 units of blood. However, the patient experienced difficulty waking up from sedation and began to wake up overnight. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable and trending up, with no blood products given in the past two days. The patient is awaiting a post-pyloric feeding tube placement by the GI team. They are currently on AC (presumably analgesic and antiemetic medications) and propofol infusion at 40 mcg/kg/min. The patient has no known drug allergies and is not listed for transplant.

24-Hour Events:
The patient was agitated and received propofol overnight intermittently. They are awaiting a post-pyloric feeding tube placement and will receive propofol to rest the gastrointestinal system. All other medications have been held due to the patient's inability to tolerate oral intake.

Vital Signs:
The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.2°C (97.1°F)
- Heart rate: 64 beats per minute
- Blood pressure: 138/72 mmHg (99/65 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on supplemental oxygen via endotracheal tube"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - IVV PPI though this is not consistent with bleed secondary to PUD
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - TID hour Hcts,  INR
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - monitoring for signs of bleeding in setting of resuming tube feeds
   today
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  AMS likely due to poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives +/-  hepatic encephalopthy.
   - d/c propofol after NGTplacement by GI
   - resume lactulose/rifaximin once NGT placed
   - propofol for now until ready to extubate
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.  Her lack of
   lacutlose due to no PO access may result in encephalopathy given GI
   Bleed.  Para yesterday [**2125-8-30**] showed no SBP.
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - NGT placement by EGD so that lactulose/refaximin can be given
   - resume vitamin K when PO access is acheived
   - hold diuretics in setting of bleed, but consider resuming when stable
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis ( in addition to VAP)
   .
   4.  Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Will broaden abx to vanco/aztreonam to cover
   PNA.   Will hold all sedatives and use propfol until ready to
   extubate.  She may have component of hepatic encephalopathy which is
   unlikely to resolve without lactulose.
   - hold fent/versed and use propofol for sedation until ready to
   extubate
   - NGT placement by GI  for lactulose/rifaximin
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back..
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever [**8-30**].  Possibilities include VAP (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was negative for
   SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - vanco/aztreonam for VAP and to cover SBP ppx in setting of GI bleed
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  Patient needs PO access to resume tube feeds.  NGT
   placement by GI today.
   .

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, which led to gastrointestinal bleeding. She underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing to control the bleeding. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her hemoglobin concentration is stable, but there is a risk of re-bleeding. Close monitoring of hourly Hcts and INR is necessary. Urgent tips placement or local control with surgery may be required if there is evidence of brisk bleeding.

2. Acute Mental Status Changes (AMS): The patient remains sedated despite being off all sedatives for 36 hours. This could be due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives or hepatic encephalopathy. Propofol will be discontinued after the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) by GI, and lactulose/rifaximin will be resumed once NGT placement is confirmed.

3. Alcoholic Cirrhosis: The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and encephalopathy. She requires weekly follow-up with a hepatologist. Her MELD score was as high as 42 last week. Currently, she is undergoing liver transplant evaluation and hopes to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - switched IV PPI to PO today
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
 consider
   removing cordis, may give FFP pre-removal
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - monitoring for signs of bleeding in setting of resuming tube feeds
   today
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  AMS likely due to poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives +/-  hepatic encephalopthy.
   - hold propofol as much as possible
   - lactulose/rifaxamin restarted yesterday
    - propofol for now until ready to extubate
   .
   Nutrition: patient now has OG tube placed under guidance by GI,
   starting tube feeds today, rectal packing gone; surgery aware that
   patient will be fed today
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose/rifaximin
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will try to narrow today,
   limited by allergies
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - stopping vanco today
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - improve MS prior to extubation, is tolerating PS well
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever [**8-30**].  Possibilities include VAP (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was negative for
   SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - stopping vanco, continue to monitor today
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  NGT, TFs starting today
   .
   Code: full, confirmed with patient, ICU consent signed

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to hemorrhoids. She underwent anoscopy and packing with improvement in bleeding. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). She is currently on low-dose nadolol and being considered for tips placement versus local control with surgery or tamponade with Foley if there is evidence of re-bleed.

The patient remains sedated, likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and hepatic encephalopathy. Propofol is being held as much as possible, and lactulose/rifaximin has been restarted.

The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, ascites, and encephalopathy, and is currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation. Her MELD score is high at 42. She is also being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension, which is most likely related to fluid overload.

The patient's respiratory status includes intubation for airway protection, with recent development of left lower lobe infiltrate but no fever or elevated white blood cell count, suggesting no pneumonia. Vancomycin has been stopped, and aztreonam will continue for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.

Other conditions mentioned include eosinophilia secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash, acute"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical conditions and potential complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Liver disease (cirrhosis): The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, which is associated with impaired liver function. Complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy may arise due to liver dysfunction.

2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing an altered mental state, possibly due to hepatic encephalopathy or other underlying causes. This could increase the risk of delirium or confusion.

3. Fluid volume overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive fluid intake-output discrepancy, suggesting fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, hypertension, or worsening heart failure.

4. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin assessment is not provided, but impaired skin integrity can occur in individuals with liver disease, leading to increased risk of infections or pressure ulcers.

5. Altered nutrition: The patient's nutrition may be compromised due to impaired liver function, which can affect nutrient metabolism and absorption. Malnutrition can lead to weakened immune system and delayed wound healing.

6. Airway compromise: The patient requires mechanical ventilation support, indicating an inability to protect their airway. There is a risk of aspiration pneumonia or other respiratory complications.

7. Ascites: Ascites, the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, is mentioned as a problem. It is commonly seen in patients with cirrhosis and can increase"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, currently undergoing pretransplant evaluation. She was initially admitted with renal failure, which improved with colloids, and also experienced a drug-related rash. The patient then developed GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia due to hemorrhoids, as confirmed by colonoscopy. She received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but cryoprecipitate was not required. Rectal packing was removed 3 days ago by surgery, and the patient will be monitored for worsening bleeding. The surgical team may attempt further containment locally using balloon tamponade, and the patient will be transfused as needed for a hematocrit (Hct) level below 30 or more frequently depending on bleeding and hemodynamic stability.

The patient also has hypernatremia, with no oral access at this time. A post-pyloric feeding tube will be placed by GI, and D5W will be given intravenously. The patient had fevers on 8/30 with left lower lobe infiltrate, but no clear source was identified. She is being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and her aztreonam will be discontinued, leaving on Silver Blood Culture Panel prophylaxis.

The patient's medical history includes EtOH cirrhosis, for which nadolol was restarted yesterday, and diuretics will be restarted"

She received 8 units of blood and 7 units of fresh frozen plasma but did not require cryoprecipitate. Rectal packing was removed 3 days ago, and she will be monitored for worsening bleeding. The patient may undergo balloon tamponade to contain the bleeding locally. Transfuse as needed for hematocrit <30 or more frequently depending on bleeding and hemodynamic stability. Transplant surgery will continue to follow, and no further packing is necessary given the cessation of bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia: The patient has evidence of diffuse varices and hemorrhoids, which could lead to further gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, and poor oral intake due to lack of PO access may worsen this condition.
3. Fevers and LLL infiltrate: The patient had low-grade fevers and a left lower lobe infiltrate, suggesting a possible lung infection or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
4. EtOH cirrhosis: The patient's underlying liver disease may progress, leading to complications such as hepatic en"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver due to alcohol abuse, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, airway compromise, ascites, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal bleed, and acute renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has fluid volume overload. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350 mL, respiratory rate set at 10 breaths per minute, and FiO2 of 40%. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 108-154 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, total bilirubin, and liver enzymes. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium levels.

Potential Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised due to liver cirrhosis and acute renal failure, making him susceptible to various infections.
2. Respiratory complications: The patient's impaired airway clearance and cough reflex increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of lower gastrointestinal bleed raises the possibility of further bleeding episodes.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can lead to worsening mental status.
5. Renal dysfunction"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - switched IV PPI to PO today
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
 consider
   removing cordis, may give FFP pre-removal
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - monitoring for signs of bleeding in setting of resuming tube feeds
   today
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  AMS likely due to poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives +/-  hepatic encephalopthy.
   - hold propofol as much as possible
   - lactulose/rifaxamin restarted yesterday
    - propofol for now until ready to extubate
   .
   Nutrition: patient now has OG tube placed under guidance by GI,
   starting tube feeds today, rectal packing gone; surgery aware that
   patient will be fed today
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose/rifaximin
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will try to narrow today,
   limited by allergies
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - stopping vanco today
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - improve MS prior to extubation, is tolerating PS well
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever [**8-30**].  Possibilities include VAP (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was negative for
   SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - stopping vanco, continue to monitor today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) due to hemorrhoids. 

The patient's medical history includes esophageal varices and antral ulcer. An endoscopy (EGD) showed no evidence of bleeding, but a colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing, which resulted in some improvement of bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but no transfusions in the past 72 hours. Her hematocrit (Hct) level is stable.

The patient has been switched from intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to oral PPI today. She will be transfused to maintain a Hct level greater than 30%. If there is evidence of re-bleeding, she may receive FFP. Vitamin K will be administered daily. The patient's access includes a right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), two 20-gauge peripheral lines, and a cordis.

The patient also has acute mental status changes (AMS) likely due to poor hepatic clearance of sedatives and/or hepatic encephalopathy. Propofol will be held as much"

   - PS weaned to 15/5, but Vt were in 250s, so had a hard time getting
   much further down than that until overnight were able to get to [**6-12**]
   this morning
   - IV PPI switched to PO
   - ran about even in AM after 20 mg IV lasix, given second dose of IV
   lasix in the evening, didn't respond, was about 300 cc positive for the

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - switched IV PPI to PO today
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis
 consider
   removing cordis, may give FFP pre-removal
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   - monitoring for signs of bleeding in setting of resuming tube feeds
   today
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  AMS likely due to poor hepatic clearance of
   sedatives +/-  hepatic encephalopthy.
   - hold propofol as much as possible
   - lactulose/rifaxamin restarted yesterday
    - propofol for now until ready to extubate
   .
   Nutrition: patient now has OG tube placed under guidance by GI,
   starting tube feeds today, rectal packing gone; surgery aware that
   patient will be fed today
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week.  Currently undergoing liver transplant
   eval and hopes to be put on the list in the upcoming days.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose/rifaximin
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will try to narrow today,
   limited by allergies
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - stopping vanco today
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - improve MS prior to extubation, is tolerating PS well
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .
   6.  S/p Fevers.  Low grade fever [**8-30**].  Possibilities include VAP (LLL
   infiltrate on CXR), drug fever (?ceftriaxone).  Para was negative for
   SBP.  Afebrile on Vanco/Aztreonam.
   - stopping vanco, continue to monitor today
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - hold diuresis
   .
   9.  RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, absolute bowel rest
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is GI bleed. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Key points from the note include:
- Propofol was turned off, and the patient became more awake and able to follow simple commands.
- The patient's PS (pressure support) was weaned to 15/5, but there were difficulties in reducing the Vt (tidal volume) below 250s until overnight when it was successfully reduced to 6-12.
- The patient was switched from IV PPI to PO and experienced lactulose stools without blood.
- Tube feeds were started per nutrition recommendations but were stopped this morning due to potential extubation.
- Antibiotics were changed from vancomycin to aztreonam for SBP prophylaxis, and cipro may be considered for narrower coverage.
- Lasix was given twice, resulting in about 300 cc positive fluid output for the 24 hours.
- The patient's vitals show a slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges.
- Respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with Vt set at 350 mL, PS at 10 cmH2O, RR set at 10, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 at 40%, and RSBI of 44.
- ABG results indicate a pH of 7.40, PaCO2 of 38, HCO3- of 98, oxygen saturation of 99%, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 245.
- Lab results show elevated leukocyte count (93 K/uL), decreased hemoglobin (13.0 g/dL), elevated potassium levels (4."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - cont PO PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis, will keep
   cordis until discharged from ICU
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  No historic problem with encephalopathy, but
   likely due to sedative effects.  Improved off sedation but then gets
   agitated.
   - lactulose/rifaxamin restarted yesterday
    - propofol for now until ready to extubate, will try to extubate this
   morning
   .
   Nutrition: OG tube being pulled out after extubation
   - speech and swallow eval post extubation
   - start PO feeds if passes, hold PO meds until speech and swallow
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week, but bili starting to trend down.
   Currently undergoing liver transplant eval and hopes to be put on the
   list soon.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose/rifaximin
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will continue, on day [**6-14**] of
   treatment
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - stopping vanco today
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - extubate today
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - will try to initiate more aggressive diuresis today
   .
   RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   - lasix 40 mg IV bid
   - when taking PO, start spironolactone 100 mg daily
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow
   .
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots
   .
   Access: right PICC, 2 20s, corids
   .
   Nutrition:  NGT, TFs starting today

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, and an EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. She underwent anoscopy with suture placement and packing, resulting in some improvement of bleeding. The patient received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but no transfusions in the last 72 hours, with stable hematocrit (Hct).

The patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36 hours but is overall improved. No historical problem with encephalopathy, but likely due to sedative effects. Improved off sedation but then becomes agitated. Lactulose/rifaximin was restarted yesterday, and propofol is being used for now until ready to extubate, with plans to try extubation this morning.

Nutrition: Oral gastric (OG) tube is being pulled out after extubation, with plans to start enteral feeds if tolerated, hold oral medications until speech and swallow evaluation.

The patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by ascites and encephalopathy in the past. She requires weekly follow-up with [**Doctor First Name 3619**], and her Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was as high as 42 last week, but bilirubin is starting to trend down. The patient is currently undergoing a liver transplant evaluation and hopes to be listed soon.

Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, and now there is a left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate. However, there are no signs of fever or elevated white blood cell count, suggesting that pneumonia is unlikely. Vancomycin is being discontinued, and aztreonam will continue for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis.

Eosinophilia: This is likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash. Trend eosinophils, and discontinue ceftriaxone.

ARF: Acute renal failure has improved from creatinine (Cr) of 4.0 to 0.8 today with albumin and holding diuretics, as well as 7 units of PRBCs a few days back. Continue to monitor.

Exfoliative dermatitis: This was evaluated by dermatology and thought to be consistent with a drug rash. Now resolving. Continue triamcinolone and sarna.

Pulmonary hypertension: Pulmonary hypertension was noted on right heart catheterization as part of the transplant workup. It is most likely related to fluid overload, although unable to diurese at the current time due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, who was admitted for acute renal failure (resolved) and drug rash. She was transferred to the MICU for a bleed and acute anemia secondary to hemorrhoids, and intubated for airway protection during massive resuscitation. She continues to experience acute respiratory failure due to altered mental status/sedation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The major barrier to extubation is the patient's altered mental status (AMS), which causes agitation and biting of the endotracheal tube. If the patient tolerates a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), extubation may be considered. 
2. Acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleed: Although there has been no recent bleed, the patient remains on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and nadolol has been started.
3. Impaired nutrition: The patient is currently receiving enteral feeds, and if extubated, a speech/swallow evaluation will be conducted prior to feeding.
4. Alcoholic cirrhosis: The patient is on lactulose/rifaximin and aztreonam for 7-day course of SBP prophylaxis. The liver team is following up with her.
5. Fluid volume overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, as indicated by increased intake and output balance.
6. Renal failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved"

","The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis admitted to ICU care. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. There are no known drug allergies.

On review of systems, the patient has altered mental status, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, airway protection issues, peripheral edema, ascites, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient also has acute renal failure.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/73 to 160/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 274 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 253. The patient's partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) to FiO2 ratio is 245.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 13.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 93 K/uL, blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL, sodium level of 140 mg/dL, potassium level of 3.3 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 40.1%, BUN level of 45 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, total bilirubin level of 2.3 mg/dL, and liver enzyme levels within normal range. The platelet count is 87,000/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 45 mg/dL, creatinine is 1.4 mg/dL, and lactate level is 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab values are provided in the attached image.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from their current condition. These include but are not limited to:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung function, potentially resulting in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status and other neurological symptoms.

3. Renal complications: Acute renal failure may progress to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to impaired immune function, especially in the setting of mechanical ventilation and invasive lines.

5. Bleeding: The patient's gastrointestinal bleed may worsen or new bleeding episodes may occur due to impaired clotting function.

6. Cardiac complications: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholic liver disease. She was admitted to the ICU for invasive ventilation and is currently extubated. The patient is likely to be listed for a liver transplant today. Her current medications include propofol, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications. She has allergies to ceftriaxone, with a rash and eosinophilia. Her vital signs are stable, but she has an altered mental status. The patient has a fluid volume overload, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, airway protection issues, ascites, peripheral edema, gastrointestinal bleed, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Due to impaired skin integrity and altered immune system function, the patient may be at an increased risk of developing infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and impaired clotting function, which puts her at risk for further bleeding episodes.
3. Respiratory complications: The patient's airway protection issues and previous invasive ventilation may increase the risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or aspiration.
4. Renal failure exacerbation: The patient's acute renal failure could worsen due to dehydration, infections, or other factors.
5. Liver transplant complications: Although not mentioned in the note, potential complications associated with liver transplantation include rejection, bleeding, infection, and post-operative complications."

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - cont PO PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis, will keep
   cordis until discharged from ICU
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  No historic problem with encephalopathy, but
   likely due to sedative effects.  Improved off sedation but then gets
   agitated.
   - lactulose restarted
    - extubated.
   .
   Nutrition: OG tube being pulled out after extubation
   -past speech and swallow today.
   -will start PO diet today.
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week, but bili starting to trend down.
   Reportedly listed.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will continue, on day [**7-15**] of
   treatment
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - vanco stopped.
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - extubated and doing well  on RA
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - diuresis
   .
   RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   - lasix 40 mg IV bid
   - when taking PO, start spironolactone 100 mg daily
   .
   FEN: PRBC transfusions, replete electrolytes, speech and swallow

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis.
- She was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF), which has improved with albumin and holding diuretics.
- The patient is now in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), likely from hemorrhoids.
- She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) but no transfusions in the last 72 hours.
- Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.
- The patient will continue with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, transfusion to keep Hct > 30, and monitoring for re-bleed.
- Vitamin K will be given daily, and a right-sided peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line will be kept until discharged from the ICU.
- Low-dose nadolol will be resumed, and urgent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement or local control with surgery versus tamponade with Foley if there is a brisk bleed.
- The patient remains sedated but is overall improved, with no historical problem with encephalopathy.
- Lactulose will be restarted, and the patient will be extubated.
- Nutrition: oral gastric tube being pulled out after extubation.

   Ms. [**Known lastname 5566**] is a 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was
   initially admitted on [**2125-8-19**] for ARF which has improved with albumin
   and holding diuretics, now in MICU for GIB (?hemorroidal).
   .
   1. GIB.  Patient has history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer.
   .EGD showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy showed bleeding
   hemorrhoids She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement
   followed by packing with some improvement of bleeding.   She is s/p 7
   units PRBCs and s/p 6 units of FFP, but no transfusions in > 72 hours.
   Hct stable.
   - cont PO PPI
   - transfuse to keep Hct > 30
   - will allow INR to rise,but transfuse FFP if there is evidence of
   re-bleed
   - vit K daily
   - Access: right sided picc, 2 20 guage peripherals, cordis, will keep
   cordis until discharged from ICU
   - resume low dose nadolol
   - urgent tips placement vs. local control with surgery (suture/clips)
   versus tamponade with foley if brisk bleed
   .
   2.  AMS.  Patient remains sedated off all sedation for 36  hours, but
   is overall improved.  No historic problem with encephalopathy, but
   likely due to sedative effects.  Improved off sedation but then gets
   agitated.
   - lactulose/rifaxamin restarted
    - extubated.
   .
   Nutrition: OG tube being pulled out after extubation
   - speech and swallow eval post extubation
   - start PO feeds if passes, hold PO meds until speech and swallow
   .
   3. Alcoholic cirrhosis.  Patient has alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by
   ascites, and encephalopathy in the past.  She requires weekly [**Doctor First Name 3619**].
   MELD as high as 42 last week, but bili starting to trend down.
   Reportedly listed.
   - cont low dose nadolol
   - cont lactulose/rifaximin
   - aztreonam to cover SBP prophylaxis
 will continue, on day [**7-15**] of
   treatment
   .
   Respiratory failure.  Patient intubated for airway protection.  Now
   with LLL infiltrate.  Has not spiked fever or had a white count.  Do
   not think she necessarily had a pneumonia.
   - vanco stopped.
   - cont aztreonam for SBP, although will try to narrow after taking with
   GI
   - extubate today
   .
   4.  Eosinophilia.  Likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
   - trend eos
   - d/c ceftriaxone
   5..  ARF.  ARF has improved from Cr of 4.0 to 0.8  today with albumin
   and holding diuretics and 7 units of PRBCs a few days back, continue to
   monitor.
   - follow Cr
   .
   7.  Exfoliative Dermatitis.  Was evaluated by derm and thought to be
   consistent wtih a drug rash.  Now resolving.
   - continue triamcinolone and sarna
   .
   8.  Pulmonary Hypertension.  Pulmonary HTN noted on right heart cath as
   part of transplant workup.  It is most likely related to fluid
   overload, though unable to diurese at current time due to GIB.
   - diuresis
   .
   RLE edema.  Patient with Right greater than Left edema.  LENI was
   negative for DVT.
   - lasix 40 mg IV bid
   - when taking PO, start spironolactone 100 mg daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis.
- She was admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient underwent anoscopy and packing for hemorrhoids, resulting in some improvement of bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP).
- The patient remains sedated but shows overall improvement. She is off all sedation for 36 hours but becomes agitated. Lactulose and rifaximin were restarted.
- The patient's nutrition will be managed through an oral gastric tube, which will be pulled out after extubation. A speech and swallow evaluation will be conducted post-extubation.
- The patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, ascites, and encephalopathy. She requires weekly follow-up with a doctor.
- The patient's respiratory status is stable with low tidal volume ventilation.
- The patient has eosinophilia likely secondary to ceftriaxone drug rash.
- ARF has improved from a creatinine level of 4.0 to 0.8 today with albumin and holding diuretics.
- The patient has exfoliative dermatitis, which is now resolving.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis who was initially admitted for acute renal failure (ARF) and is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer. An endoscopy showed no evidence of bleeding, but colonoscopy revealed bleeding hemorrhoids. The patient underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement and packing, which improved the bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but no transfusions in the last 72 hours. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.

The patient's altered mental status (AMS) is likely due to sedative effects, as she remains sedated off all sedation for 36 hours but improves when sedation is stopped. She has a history of encephalopathy, but this may not be the primary cause. Lactulose and rifaximin were restarted yesterday.

The patient's nutritional status is compromised, and an orogastric (OG) tube is being pulled out after extubation. A speech and swallow evaluation will be performed post-extubation, and if successful, the patient will start enteral feeds. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are continued, and oral medications will be held until the speech and swallow evaluation is completed.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 5566] is a 63-year-old female with alcoholic cirrhosis. She was admitted on [2125-8-19] for acute renal failure (ARF) which has improved with albumin and holding diuretics. She is currently in the MICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). She underwent anoscopy by surgery with suture placement and packing, followed by improvement of bleeding. She received 7 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), but no transfusions in the last 72 hours. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of esophageal varices and antral ulcer, which are risk factors for GIB. She underwent anoscopy and received PRBCs and FFP for bleeding. She is at risk for re-bleeding and requires continued monitoring. The plan is to keep Hct > 30, allow INR to rise, and transfuse FFP if there is evidence of re-bleed. Urgent transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement vs. local control with surgery or tamponade with a Foley catheter is being considered for brisk bleeding.

   I saw and examined this pt independently, and was present with the ICU
   housestaff team for the relevant portions of the services provided. I
   would add: 63 yo female with alcoholic cirrhosis transferred to MICU
   with GI bleed/acute blood loss anemia secondary to hemorrhoids,
   resolved. Intubated electively in anticipation of massive
   resuscitation, with subsequent course notable for continued respiratory
   failure in the context of altered mental status/sedation. Extubated
   yesterday, now requiring supplemental oxygen. Cleared by speech therapy
   for po intake. Re-starting diuretics for ascites, to complete 7 day
   course of aztreonam tomorrow. Appears appropriate for transfer to
   floor.
