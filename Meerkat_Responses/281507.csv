   Disposition:
","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presents with signs of an acute on chronic left subdural hemorrhage and a midline shift. He has also been diagnosed with gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR), anemia, and ECG changes. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 to 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise. Firstly, the acute on chronic left subdural hemorrhage requires close monitoring, and there is a possibility of further bleeding or neurological deterioration. Secondly, the gastrointestinal bleeding needs to be managed and controlled, and the source of the bleeding needs to be identified. Thirdly, the anemia needs to be corrected, and the underlying cause should be investigated. Lastly, the ECG changes should be closely monitored, especially considering the patient's history of CAD.

In summary, the potential medical complications for this patient include worsening subdural hemorrhage, uncontrolled gastrointestinal bleeding, worsening anemia, and cardiac ischemia."

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presents with signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (BRBPR), anemia, ECG changes, acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage (SDH), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), hypothyroidism (Hypothyroid), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and falls under the ICU care. 

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He is currently experiencing fatigue and shows signs of anemia, which is likely mostly gastrointestinal related and iron deficient. The patient has never had a colonoscopy, and further evaluation for the cause of GI bleed is recommended. 

The patient also has an acute on chronic subdural hemorrhage, possibly related to a fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery recommendations are being followed, including serial neuro exams q3-4 hours and consideration for floor readiness after consultation with neurosurgery. 

Additionally, the patient has hypertension, which is being held in the setting of GI bleed. His antihypertensive medications are currently withheld. 

The patient also has hyperlipidemia, which is being held acutely, with plans to restart on medical floor. 

Furthermore, the patient has hypothyroidism, for which he is continuing levothyroxine treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of gastrointestinal bleed, blood loss anemia, and subdural hematoma. He is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. The patient has no known drug allergies. His vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/59 to 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving various medications and fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has a lower gastrointestinal bleed, which can lead to further blood loss and potential hypotension.
2. Subdural Hematoma: The patient has an acute on chronic large left subdural hematoma. If it continues to expand, it may cause increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration.
3. Anemia: The patient has blood loss anemia due to the gastrointestinal bleed. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his critically ill state and possible immunosuppression.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT.
6. Stress Ulcer Bleeding: The patient is receiving stress ulcer proph"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 131/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's EKG showed ischemic changes and elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating myocardial infarction.

Over the course of the day, the patient's condition remained relatively stable, with some fluctuations in hemodynamic monitoring. The patient received fluids and blood products as needed. However, the patient experienced episodes of confusion in the evening, exhibiting delirium. Despite receiving lorazepam, the patient remained agitated. Haldol was ordered but not received.

The patient's flow sheet data indicates normal vital signs, with a slight drop in temperature. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows stable blood pressure and heart rate. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,470 mL and output of 350 mL, with a net positive balance of 3,120 mL.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Blood chemistry indicates elevated blood glucose, slightly decreased calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels. Coagulation tests reveal an extended prothrombin time and partial thromb"

   [**1-20**] CT HEAD: Stable size of left hemispheric extra-axial collection.
   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed,
   colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never
   had a colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is
   likely that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor
   today

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with bloody rice krispies-like stools (BRBPR) and increasing fatigue. The differential diagnosis for BRBPR includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, and less likely inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis. The patient has never had a colonoscopy. 

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and it is likely that a colonoscopy will be performed while the patient is on the floor. The plan is to defer the colonoscopy at this time due to bradycardia and the need for sedation for the procedure.

The patient has anemia, likely mostly gastrointestinal (GI) related and iron deficient. Iron labs will be checked and b-12 and folate levels may be checked as an outpatient.

There have been EKG changes with mild elevations in aVR, which could be consistent with a very proximal left anterior descending (LAD) lesion. However, given the patient's CABG, his anatomy is likely altered and the significance of the aVR change is questionable. In the setting of some other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. The patient also experienced an episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia with repeat EKG."

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.

   # BRBPR: Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed,
   colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never
   had a colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan for colonoscopy today
   - Maintain 2 PIV
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed; can restart after etiology
   identified
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; continue to follow as it appears they have
   ordered CTA
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presents with bloody brownish-red pink mucoid (BRBPR) in the setting of increasing fatigue. The differential diagnosis for BRBPR includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, and less likely inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis. The patient has never had a colonoscopy.

The patient is overall hemodynamically stable. The plan includes obtaining a GI consult, performing a colonoscopy today, maintaining two peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, serial hemoglobin (Hct) checks every 12 hours with a goal of >25, continuing active type and cross matching, NPO (nothing by mouth) other than colonoscopy prep, maintenance intravenous fluids (IVF), and holding aspirin due to suspected GI bleed.

The patient is also anemic, likely mostly due to GI bleeding and iron deficiency. It is planned to check iron labs, consider checking vitamin B-12 and folate as an outpatient, and continue to follow the GI consult. Serial Hct q12 with a goal of >25 is also planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   .
   # BRBPR: Has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool x3 days.
   Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed, colonic mass,
   colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never had a
   colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is likely
   that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   .
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   .
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   .
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He presented with bloody rice Krispy-like stools, fatigue, and a low hemoglobin level. The differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, and less likely inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis. The patient has not had a colonoscopy before. He is currently hemodynamically stable, and it is likely that a colonoscopy will be performed while the patient is on the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has been experiencing bradycardia throughout the day, with a low of 29 bpm while sleeping. It is important to monitor his heart rate and ensure that there are no further episodes of bradycardia.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to a GI bleed. This should be closely monitored, and iron studies should be checked. The goal is to maintain a hemoglobin level above 25.
3. EKG changes: The patient's EKG shows mild elevations in aVR, which could be consistent with a proximal LAD lesion. However, given the patient's CABG surgery, the significance of these changes is questionable. Further monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
4. Subdural hematoma: The patient has an acute-on-chron"

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with bloody rice krinkles per rectum (BRBPR) and increasing fatigue. The differential diagnosis for BRBPR includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, and less likely inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bradycardia: The patient has had episodes of bradycardia during his hospitalization. He is asymptomatic and has been placed on a pacer pad by the bedside. An electrocardiogram (EKG) shows sinus bradycardia, and he is scheduled to see an electrophysiology (EP) consultant.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia that is likely mostly gastrointestinal (GI) related and iron deficiency. Further investigations, such as checking iron labs, b-12, and folate levels, will be done. A GI consult has been appreciated, and the patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) will be monitored every 12 hours with a goal of keeping it above 25%.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year old male with a history of CAD s/p CABG who presents with BRBPR
   in the setting of increasing fatigue.
   # BRBPR: Has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool x3 days.
   Differential includes diverticulosis, hemmorhoidal bleed, colonic mass,
   colitis, ulcer, less likely IBD/UC.  Patient has never had a
   colonoscopy.  Currently overall hemodynamically stable and it is likely
   that we may perform colonoscopy while patient on floor.
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Plan to defer colonoscopy at this time given bradycardia/need for
   sedation for procedure
   - Maintain 2 PIV, large-bore
   - Serial hct q8, goal > 25
   - Continue active type and cross
   - NPO other than colonoscopy prep
   - Maintenance IVF; bolus prn
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   # Anemia: likely mostly GI related and Fe def.  Will check Fe labs.
   Consider checking b-12 and folate as outpatient
   - Appreciate GI consult; continue to follow
   - Serial hct q12, goal > 25
   # EKG changes: Patient without any chest pain and CE enzymes negative.
   The mild elevations in aVR could be consistent with a very proximal LAD
   lesion.  However given CABG, his anatomy likely altered and
   questionable significance of the aVR change. In the setting of some
   other TWF, this may just represent mild demand ischemia. Patient had
   episode of bradycardia overnight and appears to be sinus bradycardia
   with repeat EKG Given other issues would not be a candidate for
   anticoagulation at this time.
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Repeat EKG and follow; EP consult
 might need pacer particularly in
   light of recent hx of falls with subdural.
   - Hold ASA in setting of GI bleed
   - Follow neuro exam
   # SDH: Patient with acute on chronic subdural bleed.  Likely related to
   fall and head trauma a few weeks ago. Neurosurgery has agreed patient
   is a candidate for floor.
   - Appreciate neurosurg recs; follow CT head for SDH/bradycardia
   - Keppra 500mg PO/IV bid for prophylaxis
   - Follow neuro exam
   # HTN: Holding antihypertensives in the setting of GI bleed
   .
   # HLD: Holding statin acutely, plan to restart on medical floor
   .
   # Hypothyroid: Continue levothyroxine
   .
   # BPH: Holding prostate meds in setting of GI bleed.  If difficulty
   passing urine will place foley.
   .
   # FEN: Maintenance IVF; bolus prn, replete electrolytes, NPO for
   procedure
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots
   # Access: PIVx1; will attempt to replace a second IV today
   # Communication: Patient, patient
s family
   # Code:  Full (although patient wants to talk with family about
   options)
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement; likely can go to floor
   today

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who presented with bloody rectal bleeding (BRBPR) and increasing fatigue. The patient has been without repeat episodes of bloody stool for three days. The differential diagnosis includes diverticulosis, hemorrhoidal bleed, colonic mass, colitis, ulcer, and less likely inflammatory bowel disease/ulcerative colitis. The patient has never had a colonoscopy. 

The patient is currently hemodynamically stable, and it is likely that a colonoscopy will be performed while the patient is on the floor. The plan is to defer colonoscopy at this time due to bradycardia and the need for sedation for the procedure. 

Other assessments and plans include anemia, EKG changes, subdural hematoma, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and fluid electrolyte imbalance. The patient is NPO except for colonoscopy prep and is receiving maintenance IV fluids. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, development of deep vein thrombosis, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and worsening of the subdural hematoma."
