   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 41 year old with HIV, Hep C with recent CD4 41. Presents
   with fever, generalized malaise, myalgias, diarrhea and cough of 3 day
   duration.
   .
    41 y/o M with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with
   increased respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress: The patient is currently on treatment for CAP
   with negative cultures to date. BAL performed yesterday and culture
   results pending. CT chest from [**9-22**] demonstrates extensive infiltrate
   and ground glass bilaterally which likely represents infection. He is
   currently on treatment for PCP as well with bactrim and steroids.
   - continue bactrim at treatment dose with IV steroids
   - continue treatment for CAP with consideration of broadening coverage
   to include HCAP (however, given lack of new fever new infection is less
   likely)
   - follow BAL, viral, and sputum cultures
   - aspergillus galactomannan negative, beta glucan pending
   - albuteral/atrovent nebs prn
   - if experiences respiratory fatigue, will likely need at least
   non-invasive ventilation
   - ruling out for TB, await BAL results before d/c of precautions
   - maintain respiratory precautions for now
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis: Patient's bicarb down to 13 on labs on arrival.
   Lactate also elevated on ABG on the floor. No anion gap so differential
   includes compensation for respiratory alkalosis, diarrhea (none
   reported for several days), RTA.
   -          continue to monitor with relationship to respiratory status
   -          trend lactate
   .
   # Hyponatremia: ? volume depletion as hospitalized and likely NPO for
   bronch yesterday versus SIADH [**2-5**] lung process.
   - continue to monitor
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: Continue HAART. ID following and appreciate their recs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C who was admitted to the MICU with increased respiratory distress. The patient's symptoms include fever, generalized malaise, myalgias, diarrhea, and cough of 3-day duration.

The assessment indicates that the patient has respiratory distress, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and potential complications related to HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. The patient is currently on treatment for CAP and PCP, with negative cultures to date. A CT chest from September 22nd shows extensive infiltrate and ground glass bilaterally, which likely represents infection. The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, and he may require non-invasive ventilation if necessary.

The patient also has metabolic acidosis with a bicarbonate level of 13 and elevated lactate. This could be due to compensation for respiratory alkalosis, diarrhea (which the patient has not reported recently), or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Monitoring the patient's lactate levels and bicarbonate levels will be important.

Additionally, the patient has hyponatremia, which could be caused by volume depletion as a result of being NPO for a bronch procedure or SIADH related to lung processes. The patient's sodium levels and urine electrolytes will be closely monitored.

In terms of HIV/AIDS management, the patient is on HAART, and the ID team is following up with recommendations. They would"

   Assessment and Plan
   41 y/o M with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with
   increased respiratory distress following treatment initiation for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) 931**].
   .
   # Pneumocyctis pneumonia:  Worsening disease following treatment is
   expected with PCP pneumonia, as confirmed by positive PCP exam from
   BAL.   The patient is currently on treatment for CAP with negative
   cultures to date. BAL performed yesterday and culture results pending.
   CT chest from [**9-22**] demonstrates extensive infiltrate and ground glass
   bilaterally which likely represents infection. He is currently on
   treatment for PCP as well with bactrim and steroids.
   - continue bactrim at treatment dose with IV steroids.  Will cut IV
   dose in half today and start PO prednisone once nausea resolved.
   - discontinue CAP treatment.
   - follow BAL, viral, and sputum cultures
   - aspergillus galactomannan negative, beta glucan pending
   - albuteral/atrovent nebs prn
   - ruling out for TB, await BAL results before d/c of precautions
   - maintain respiratory precautions for now
   .
   # Acidosis: Small anion gap secondary to elevated lactate.
   Persistently elevated lactate is consistent with PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 931**].
Serum
   levels of LDH, beta-D-glucan, and KL-6 were significantly higher in
   PCP-[**Name10 (NameIs) 932**] patients (p < 0.01).
  Chest. [**2117**] [**Month (only) **];131(4):1173-80.
   Likely also has a non-gap acidoses from compensation for respiratory
   alkalosis, diarrhea (none reported for several days), RTA.
   - continue to monitor with relationship to respiratory status
   - trend lactate
   .
   # Hyponatremia: ? volume depletion as hospitalized and likely NPO for
   bronch yesterday versus SIADH [**2-5**] lung process.  Urine lytes
   concentrated, consistent with ADH, but not helpful in determining
   hyponatremia type.  Has not had worsening hyponatremia with fluids so
   will cautiously continue, as he is likely to be dry from recent poor
   PO.
   - D5 NS @ 150 cc/hr for 1L
   - Recheck electrolytes in PM
   .
   # HIV/AIDS: Continue HAART. ID following and appreciate their recs.
   .
   # Hepatitis C: Apparently, complains of right upper quadrant pain
   frequently. Continue to monitor.
   .
   # FEN: advance diet today as patient tolerates, replete lytes prn
   .
   # PPx: bowel meds prn, hep sc tid, ppi.

   # Dispo: Respiratory status stabilized.  Will call out to floor.  If
   AFB from concentrated BAL negative, does not need negative pressure
   isolation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with increased respiratory distress following treatment initiation for PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). The patient is currently on treatment for both CAP (Community-acquired pneumonia) and PCP with negative cultures to date. A BAL (Bronchoalveolar lavage) performed yesterday has culture results pending. The patient's CT chest from September 22nd demonstrates extensive infiltrate and ground glass appearance bilaterally, which likely represents infection. The patient is being treated for PCP with bactrim and steroids.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Worsening PCP pneumonia: The patient's condition is expected to worsen following treatment for PCP pneumonia, as confirmed by positive PCP exam from BAL. Monitoring the patient's respiratory status and adjusting treatment accordingly will be important.

2. Acidosis: The patient has small anion gap secondary to elevated lactate, which is consistent with PCP infection. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's lactate levels in relation to their respiratory status.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia may be due to volume depletion as a result of being hospitalized and likely NPO (nothing by mouth) for a bronch yesterday, or it could be caused by SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone)"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C. He presented with fever, generalized malaise, myalgias, diarrhea, and cough for 3 days. The patient has been admitted to the MICU with increased respiratory distress. 

The patient is currently on treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with negative cultures to date. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed yesterday, and culture results are pending. A CT chest from September 22nd showed extensive infiltrate and ground glass bilaterally, which likely represents infection. He is also being treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) with Bactrim and steroids. 

The plan includes continuing Bactrim at treatment dose with IV steroids, continuing treatment for CAP with consideration of broadening coverage to include healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), following BAL, viral, and sputum cultures, and ruling out tuberculosis before discontinuing respiratory precautions. Non-invasive ventilation may be needed if the patient experiences respiratory fatigue. 

The patient has metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate level of 13 and elevated lactate on the ABG. No anion gap is present, suggesting possible compensation for respiratory alkalosis, diarrhea (which the patient denies), or renal tubular acidosis (RTA). Monitoring the patient's lactate levels and bicarbonate levels is recommended. 

Hyponatremia is also present,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with increased respiratory distress, abdominal pain, and rising lactate levels. The patient is currently being treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) with IV bactrim and high-dose steroids. His ABG demonstrates compensatory respiratory alkalosis in the setting of metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is due to PCP pneumonia. Despite being on treatment, the patient appears to be fatiguing, indicating a potential need for intubation. Close monitoring and repeated ABG assessment are required to reassess the respiratory status.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's bicarbonate level is low, and lactate is elevated. This could be due to an acute intraabdominal process, medication-related issues, or hypovolemia. Further evaluation of the abdomen with imaging and discussion with the ID team regarding HAART regimen are recommended.

3. Abdominal Pain: The patient has rising lactate levels in the setting of abdominal pain, raising concern for an intraabdominal process. A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is planned to investigate further. Stool output should be monitored, and tests for Clostridium difficile should be sent.

4. Hyponatremia: The cause of hyponatremia is unclear, with possibilities including volume depletion"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute liver failure secondary to alcoholic hepatitis. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse and presents with elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and jaundice. The patient's 24-hour events include a fall, planned bedside paracentesis that was not performed due to no accessible fluid collection, and a change in antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, stable blood pressure, normal heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 96% on room air. Hemodynamic monitoring shows an increased total intake of fluids and a significant output of fluids, resulting in a negative fluid balance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 97.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in various areas including peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessment, and tone. The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, and lipase. There are also abnormalities in kidney function tests, liver function tests, electrolytes, and coagulation parameters. The patient has a low albumin level and an elevated lactate level.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications and has multiple lines, including a 20-gauge line placed on 09/24/2018 at 12:00 PM. He is receiving prophylactic antibiotics for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with PCP pneumonia, abdominal pain, and rising lactate levels. The patient experienced subjective shortness of breath and sharp, substernal chest pain at 11:30 PM, which resolved with oxycodone.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including primaquine and clindamycin for PCP pneumonia, thiamine and sodium bicarbonate for HAART-associated lactic acidosis, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's lactate level has improved from 6.4 to 3.4 mmol/L.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.4Â°C (95.7Â°F), heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/72 mmHg to 129/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is currently on room air and not requiring supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is drowsy and alert, with pale conjunctivae, a soft systolic murmur, and trace bilateral edema. The patient's abdomen is distended with mild tenderness.

likely due to underlying edema. However, inflammatory and infectious process
cannot be ruled out.
   Assessment and Plan
   41 y/o M with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with PCP
   pneumonia, abdominal pain and rising lactate
   .
   # Lactic acidosis: [**Month (only) 8**] be related to HAART, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1009**]
   process.  Resolving, now 3.4.  Decreased value may be an effect of
   bicarbonate overnight.  Will discuss with ID, but duration of lactate
   acidosis from HAART is reportedly 7-14 days and his lactate may take
   this long to resolve.  No suggestion from imaging or peritoneal fluid
   labs for an intra-abdominal cause.
   - Hold HAART therapy, discussed with ID
   - continue to trend
   - Thiamine and NaHCO3 for treatment of lactatic acidosis
   .
   # PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) **]:  On primaquine and clindamycin.  Oxygenation is much

   # Acute renal failure: Likely [**2-5**] mitochondrial dysfunction.  Also got
   contrast.
   - Send urine lytes, sediment, eos
   - Would c/s renal if not resolved.

   # Abdominal Pain: Low-protein ascites and abdominal pain in the context
   of hep C and EtOH use are consistent with imaging suggestive of
   cirrhosis.  This fluid is likely the cause of his abdominal pain.  C.
   diff negative.
   - Well controlled without medications.  Can use low dose opiods if
   needed.  Would avoid APAP.
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely SIADH from lung disease as not resolved with

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C admitted to the MICU with PCP pneumonia, abdominal pain, and rising lactate. The patient's symptoms and lab results indicate several potential medical complications, including lactic acidosis, PCP pneumonia, acute renal failure, abdominal pain due to cirrhosis, hyponatremia, and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Lactic Acidosis: The patient has a high lactate level of 3.4 mmol/L, indicating lactic acidosis. This may be related to HAART therapy, PCP infection, or other underlying conditions. Treatment includes thiamine and sodium bicarbonate.

2. PCP Pneumonia: The patient is being treated with primaquine and clindamycin for PCP pneumonia. Oxygenation has improved, but the patient still requires nebs prn.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute renal failure due to mitochondrial dysfunction and contrast exposure. Further evaluation is needed, including urine lytes, sediment, eos, and consideration for renal catheterization if necessary.

4. Abdominal Pain: The patient's abdominal pain is associated with low-protein ascites and cirrhosis. Imaging suggests nodular liver with recanalization of the umbilical vein and underlying splenomegaly. Treatment involves managing pain with low-dose opioids and avoiding APAP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS admitted to the ICU with complaints of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. The patient underwent paracentesis and was found to have lactic acidosis, for which he was started on thiamine and NaHCO3 in D5W. The patient also has pneumonia, abdominal pain, hypotension, and hyponatremia. His vital signs are stable, but he requires respiratory support with O2 delivery device and ABG analysis. The patient's labs indicate elevated lactate levels, low sodium, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is currently receiving various medications, including antibiotics, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe lactic acidosis: The patient's lactic acid levels are elevated, indicating a potential complication of lactic acidosis. This can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating possible hypotension. This can compromise organ perfusion and lead to organ damage if not corrected.
3. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium levels, which can cause symptoms such as confusion, seizures, or muscle weakness. It is important to monitor and correct the sodium levels to avoid these complications.
4. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest pneumonia, which can lead to respiratory failure if not treated appropriately"
