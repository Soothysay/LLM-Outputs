   Assessment and Plan
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   .
   58M with h/o CML, failed Gleevac, s/p HSCT in [**9-22**] complicated by GVHD
   on chronic suppression, history of PE a/w multifocal pneumonia, who
   presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory
   distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Felt to be secondary to components of
   bronchospasm and fluid overload in setting of procedure and
   hypertension.  Also on differential are aspiration and progression of
   multifocal pneumonia. Intubated from noninvasives yesterday [**12-20**] resp
   distress with difficulty ventilating and inc work of breathing. Pt has
   had inc secretions overnight and is breathing over the vent at 20-22.
   Not ready for extubation yet, but will wean.
   - on 200 fentanyl, 4 versed will wean appropriately
   - will wean to pressure support
   .
   # Hypotension: In setting of antihypertensives and diuresis.  Worsening
   infection is a possibility.  Post-procedure increased inflammatory
   response also possible.  Relative adrenal insufficiency maybe
   contributing. Baseline BP in 120s. Need to treat underlying cause,
   probably infection.
   - IVF to CVP 10, and levophed at 0.04, will wean today
   - per ID: Cont vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/tobra/vori (can broaden to include VRE if
   worsens)
   - If febrile, persistently hypotensive, or +Bcx, plan to pull PICC line
   - cont Hydrocort 50 mg IV Q6
   - Hold BB
   .
   # Pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia with ESBL e.coli in sputum.
   - ID: vanc/[**Last Name (un) 430**]/tobra/vori / Prophylactic bactrim // thought VRE was
   unlikely despite past history
   - f/u BAL results
   - Broaden coverage as above if decompensates
   - Cx-ray in AM
   .
   # Anemia: Pt had 24 hr HCT drop from 27 to 21, Plts 231 -> 187, WBC 9.2
   -> 5.6. Etiology could be hemolysis/DIC vs diluational vs bone marrow
   suppression (pt is on many drugs, and new antibiotics). No recent
   instrumentation/lines placed for RP bleed concern.
   - f/u hemolysis/DIC labs
   - given 1U pRBC this AM, may also help to give colloid given pt is
   probably 3^rd spacing (albumin 2.5)
   - guiaic stools
   - can CT scan if pt is still bleeding
   .
   # Transaminitis: Near baseline.  MRI liver negative or acute process.
   - Cont trend
   .
   # CML:
   - Cont bactrim and acyclovir for PPX
   - Per primary oncologist
   .
   # History of PE:
   On lovenox
   .
   # Pain:
   - Holding fentanyl patch, lidocaine patches in acute setting
   .
   # Chronic GVHD:
   - Cont budesonide, high dose steroids and cellcept
   - Cellcept level in AM

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and previous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents to the ICU following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress. The patient has impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pain control, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor perfusion.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress could progress into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to antihypertensive medications, diuretic use, infection, or relative adrenal insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 6.7 g/dL to 5.6 g/dL within 24 hours. This may indicate ongoing hemolysis or bleeding. Further investigation is required.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with an identified organism (ESBL E. coli). Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued based on the sensitivity results.
6. Transaminitis: The patient's liver"

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. The patient has been on chronic suppression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents to the hospital following a bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory distress.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has chronic GVHD, which can affect the skin.
2. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient experienced respiratory distress after a bronchoscopy, which may be secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, hypertension, aspiration, or progression of multifocal pneumonia.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient has been hypotensive, possibly due to antihypertensives, diuretics, worsening infection, increased inflammatory response after a procedure, or relative adrenal insufficiency.
4. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient requires pain management for both acute and chronic pain.
5. Multifocal pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia caused by ESBL E.coli, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased, possibly due to hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), dilutional, or bone marrow suppression.
7. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be due to an acute process or chronic condition.
8. History of PE: The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism and is on anticoagulation therapy.
9. Chronic GVHD: The patient requires ongoing management for chronic GVHD.
10. Pain: The patient requires ongoing pain management.

The patient is receiving tube feeds for nutrition, and prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with Lovenox, stress ulcer prevention with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention with head of bed elevation.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications in the ICU setting."

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in [9-22] complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) on chronic suppression. The patient presents to the ICU following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory distress. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), hypotension, and pain control issues.
- The patient's respiratory distress is secondary to components of bronchospasm and fluid overload in the setting of the procedure and hypertension. Other possible causes include aspiration and progression of multifocal pneumonia.
- The patient has multifocal pneumonia with ESBL E. coli in sputum, and BAL grew resistant pseudomonas. Antibiotic therapy has been adjusted accordingly.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to antihypertensives, diuresis, or worsening infection. Other possible causes include post-procedure increased inflammatory response, relative adrenal insufficiency, and baseline BP in the 120s. Current BPs are stable in the 100s-120s, off pressors.
- The patient's anemia could be due to hemolysis/DIC, dilutional, bone marrow suppression (patient on many drugs, new antibiotics), or recent instrumentation/lines placed for RP bleed concern. Currently stable at 24.3.
- The patient's transaminitis is near baseline, and MRI liver negative or acute process.
- The patient has a history of chronic GVHD and is currently on budesonide, home dose steroids, and cellcept.
- The patient is also on lovenox for prophylaxis against PE.
- The patient has chronic pain issues and has been restarted on fentanyl patch and lidocaine patch.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and acute respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, potentially necessitating increased support or interventions such as tracheostomy.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of multifocal pneumonia with resistant pseudomonas may lead to worsening infection, sepsis, and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Hypotension: If the underlying cause of hypotension is not addressed, it may progress to shock and organ failure.
4. Anemia: Further drop in hemoglobin levels may result in severe anemia, leading to fatigue, decreased oxygen carrying capacity, and potential cardiac complications.
5. Transaminitis: Continued elevation in liver enzymes may indicate ongoing liver injury or acute hepatic insult, which could lead to hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy.
6. Chronic GVHD: The patient's chronic GVHD requires ongoing immunosuppression, and any exacerbation of this condition may lead to increased risk of infections and other complications.
7. Pain management: Inadequate control of pain may result in increased patient discomfort, agitation, and potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility."

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. He presents with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, and was intubated due to difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing. He has been on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for the past 24 hours.

The patient's pneumonia is multifocal with an infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Escherichia coli and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, tobramycin, voriconazole, and ciprofloxacin.

He also has hypotension, which may be due to antihypertensive medications, diuretics, worsening infection, or a post-procedure inflammatory response. The patient's blood pressure is currently stable at 131/63 mmHg.

The patient has anemia with a drop in hemoglobin from 8.0 g/dL to 7.0 g/dL. The etiology could be hemolysis/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), dilutional, or bone marrow suppression. The patient's platelet count has also decreased from 231,000/mm^3 to 187,000/mm^3. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. He has been on chronic suppression for graft versus host disease (GVHD) and presents with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). He has a history of pneumonia, including multifocal pneumonia with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics for his infection, including vancomycin, tobramycin, voriconazole, ciprofloxacin, and bactrim. His blood cultures are positive for ESBL E. coli and resistant Pseudomonas. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on supplemental oxygen. His laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is also anemic with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL and has a history of pain control, chronic GVHD, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He is currently receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's disposition is ICU level of care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory distress and is intubated on mechanical ventilation. There is a possibility of progression to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or failure to wean off mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of multifocal pneumonia with resistant organisms, including ESBL E. coli and Pseudomonas. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of new pulmonary complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits but there is a concern for potential hypotension, especially if the underlying infection worsens or if there is a relative adrenal insufficiency contributing to his condition.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level, which could be due to various causes such as hemolysis, dilutional effect, bone marrow suppression, or other underlying conditions.
5. Transaminitis: The patient's liver enzymes are slightly elevated, but near baseline. Monitoring of liver function is important to detect any acute process or progression of liver involvement.
6. Chronic GVHD: The patient has a history of chronic GVHD,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient presented to the hospital with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy and was intubated due to difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) and partial extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) yesterday and will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today. The patient's pneumonia is caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli and resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic therapy includes ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin. The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to infection or antihypertensive medications, and anemia with a decreased hematocrit. The patient is being treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and antibiotics for the hypotension, and will have a chest X-ray in the morning. The anemia etiology is uncertain but could be related to hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), dilutional, or bone marrow suppression. The patient's transaminase levels are near baseline, and he has a history of chronic GVHD, for which he is receiving immunosuppressive therapy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. He presented to the hospital following a bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory distress. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli and resistant Pseudomonas. He also has impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), and chronic pain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with ESBL E. coli and resistant Pseudomonas. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not properly managed.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to antihypertensives, diuresis, worsening infection, or relative adrenal insufficiency. There is a risk of organ hypoperfusion and shock.
4. Anemia: The patient's HCT dropped from 27% to 21%, and platelet count decreased from 231 to 187. The cause of anemia could be hemolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), dilutional, or bone marrow suppression. Monitoring of complete blood count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. He presented to the hospital with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, and was intubated due to difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday and remains on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. 

The patient has a past medical history of pneumonia with esophageal involvement and resistant pseudomonas infection. He is currently receiving treatment for multifocal pneumonia caused by ESBL E. coli and resistant pseudomonas. The patient's blood cultures grew resistant pseudomonas, and his sputum culture showed ESBL E. coli. His chest X-ray indicates worsening left-sided atelectasis versus consolidation versus collapse. 

The patient also has hypotension, possibly due to antihypertensives, diuresis, worsening infection, or increased inflammatory response from the bronchoscopy. His blood pressure has been in the range of 130s to 180s. 

Furthermore, the patient has anemia with a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 27% to 21%, but it has stabilized at 27.3%. His platelet count decreased from 231"

   on chronic suppression, history of PE a/w multifocal pneumonia, who
   presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory
   distress that required intubation, now difficult to wean.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Felt to be secondary to components of
   bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
   Also on differential are aspiration and progression of multifocal
   pneumonia. Intubated from noninvasives [**12-20**] resp distress with
   difficulty ventilating and inc work of breathing. Failed SBT on [**6-12**].
   Tolerating PSV 5, PEEP 10, FIO2 40%.  Still w/ large amount of
   secretions.  Evidence of pulm edema on CXR, HTNsive which could be
   contributing to pulm edema as pt w/ presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF
   60%).  Tolerated PSV 5/5 for 5hrs this am, which is an improvement from
   yesterday.
   - keep on PSV 5/10 overnight, switch to [**3-21**] [**Doctor First Name **] am and try SBT.
   Possibly extubation to non-[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9820**] [**Doctor First Name **].
   - cont tobra and Cipro to tx PNA
   - diuresis w/ diamox for goal of -500 mL
   - f/u q6h lytes, replete as necessary
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - on 120 fentanyl,1.5 versed will wean appropriately for SBT tomorrow
   # Pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia BAL growing 2 strains of resistant
   pseudomonas (sensitivities above).  CXR w/ improvement of L sided
   atelectasis.
   - ID: dc [**Last Name (un) 430**] D18 today.
   - ID: cont tobra D3/Cipro D2 for pseudomonas PNA tx, total course 15
   days.
   - if spikes consider adding zosyn to double cover Cipro intermediate
   pseudomonas strain
   - ID: cont vori ppx dosing.
   - cont to f/u WBC and fever curve
   - Cx-ray in AM
   - will repeat tobra peak/trough as previous wasn
t done correctly as
   per ID
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Other possible
   explanations worsening infection or increased inflammatory response
   post procedure.  Pt had relative adrenal insufficiency as he is on
   chronic steroids and wasn
t started on stress dose, so this may have
   also contributed. Hypotension has resolved.  Pt
s anti-HTN had been
   held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the 130s-150s range
   consistently.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.
   - increase metoprolol 50mg TID
   - cont to monitor HR and BP closely
   - f/u CXR in the am
   #Contraction alkalosis:  Pt currently w/ contraction alkalosis as a
   result of aggressive diuresis yesterday.
   - hold lasix for now
   - cont diuresing to -500mL, will use diamox to prevent further
   contraction alkalosis
   - monitor q6h lytes, replete as necessary
   #Hypernatremia:  Pt w/ slight hypernatremia (Na 146) as a result of
   aggressive diuresis.  Currently receiving tube feeds w/ free water
   flushes.
   - increase free water flushes w/ tube feeds to 100mL q4h
   - f/u q6h lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Pt had 24 hr HCT drop from 27 to 21, Plts 231 -> 187, WBC 9.2
   -> 5.6, on [**6-10**]. Etiology could be hemolysis/DIC vs diluational vs bone
   marrow suppression (pt is on many drugs, and new antibiotics). No
   recent instrumentation/lines placed for RP bleed concern.  Currently
   stable, at 27.3.
   - f/u cbc
   - can CT scan if pt Hct drops
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST and ALT now almost at baseline.  AP and LDH mildly
   elevated from previous measurement.  Possibly due to GVHD.  MRI liver
   negative or acute process.
   - will cont to trend LFT
   .
   # CML:
   - Cont bactrim, acyclovir and vori for PPX
   - Per primary oncologist
   .
   # History of PE:
   - On lovenox
   .
   # Pain:  Pt c/o persistent abdominal pain, not well controlled w/
   fentanyl drip.
   - will increase fentanyl patch to 200mcg for better pain control, and
   so fentanyl drip can be dc
d after succesfull extubation.
   - cont lidocaine patch
   .
   # Chronic GVHD:
   - Cont budesonide, home dose steroids and cellcept

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the ICU following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress, requiring intubation. The patient has been difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation due to bronchospasm, fluid overload, hypertension, and possible aspiration or progression of multifocal pneumonia. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 143/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.47, PaCO2 56 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 232.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's primary concerns include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, hypotension, pneumonia, and contraction alkalosis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation and synchronized intermittent mandatory breaths (SIMV). The plan is to continue aggressive pulmonary toilet, diuresis with Lasix for fluid overload, and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics for pseudomonas pneumonia. The patient's pain control needs are also being addressed with fentanyl and Versed.

   presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory
   distress that required intubation, now difficult to wean.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Felt to be secondary to components of
   bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
   Also on differential are aspiration and progression of multifocal
   pneumonia. Intubated from noninvasives [**12-20**] resp distress with
   difficulty ventilating and inc work of breathing. Failed SBT on [**6-12**].
   Tolerating PSV 5, PEEP 10, FIO2 40%.  Still w/ large amount of
   secretions.  Evidence of pulm edema on CXR, HTNsive which could be
   contributing to pulm edema as pt w/ presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF
   60%).  Tolerated PSV 5/5 for 5hrs this am, which is an improvement from
   yesterday.
   - keep on PSV 5/10 overnight, switch to [**3-21**] [**Doctor First Name **] am and try SBT.
   Possibly extubation to non-[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9820**] [**Doctor First Name **].

   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Other possible
   explanations worsening infection or increased inflammatory response
   post procedure.  Pt had relative adrenal insufficiency as he is on
   chronic steroids and wasn
t started on stress dose, so this may have
   also contributed. Hypotension has resolved.  Pt
s anti-HTN had been
   held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the 130s-150s range
   consistently.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.
   - increase metoprolol 50mg TID
   - cont to monitor HR and BP closely
   - f/u CXR in the am
   #Contraction alkalosis:  Pt currently w/ contraction alkalosis as a
   result of aggressive diuresis yesterday.
   - hold lasix for now
   - cont diuresing to -500mL, will use diamox to prevent further
   contraction alkalosis
   - monitor q6h lytes, replete as necessary
   #Hypernatremia:  Pt w/ slight hypernatremia (Na 146) as a result of
   aggressive diuresis.  Currently receiving tube feeds w/ free water
   flushes.
   - increase free water flushes w/ tube feeds to 100mL q4h

   marrow suppression (pt is on many drugs, and new antibiotics). No
   recent instrumentation/lines placed for RP bleed concern.  Currently
   stable, at 27.3.
   - f/u cbc

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the hospital with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, which required intubation. He has been difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode. His medical history also includes pulmonary embolism (PE) and chronic steroid use for GVHD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory distress and difficulty in weaning from mechanical ventilation indicate a risk of continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring and aggressive pulmonary toilet are recommended.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with resistant pseudomonas infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is essential, and the need for additional coverage should be considered based on sensitivities.
3. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure requires careful management. Adjustments in antihypertensive medication and diuretic therapy may be necessary.
4. Contraction Alkalosis: The patient's aggressive diuresis has resulted in contraction alkalosis. Holding lasix and using diamox may help prevent further alkalosis.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's slight hypernatremia requires monitoring and appropriate fluid management to avoid dehydration.
6. Anemia: The patient"

   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Other possible
   explanations worsening infection or increased inflammatory response
   post procedure.  Pt had relative adrenal insufficiency as he is on
   chronic steroids and wasn

   also contributed. Hypotension has resolved.  Pt
s anti-HTN had been
   held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the 130s-150s range
   consistently.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in the past. The patient presents to the ICU with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy procedure. 

The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure and is currently on mechanical ventilation with PSV (pressure support ventilation) mode, PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure) set at 5 cmH2O, FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) set at 40%. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/73 mmHg to 162/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14,100 cells/μL, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and slightly abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST). The patient's renal function is within normal limits.

The patient's chest X-ray reveals worsening left-sided atelectasis versus consolidation versus collapse. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture results show growth of two strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and sensitivity testing has been performed to guide antibiotic therapy.

","The patient is a 67-inch, 80.5 kg male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to severe pneumonia. The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a level of 5 cmH2O overnight. He received a total of 60 mg IV lasix. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has been receiving various antibiotics including vancomycin, acyclovir, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), voriconazole, meropenem, tobramycin, and ciprofloxacin. 

The patient is currently receiving infusions of midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 1.5 mg/hour, enoxaparin (Lovenox), furosemide (Lasix), midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, and other medications. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.3 to 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 74 and 102 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 96/62 to 162/80 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14 and 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 4,752 mL with 989 mL given intravenously, 1,920 mL taken orally, 421 mL taken through total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 2,432 mL given intravenously. The output includes 6,165 mL of urine, 64 mL of nasogastric (NG) output, and a negative balance of 1,413 mL. 

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 480 mL with a range of 97 to 1,332 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 45, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 16 cmH2O, and the patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 95%. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate pH of 7.47, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 232 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 92 mEq/L, base excess (BE) of -20 cmH2O, ventilation rate (Ve) of 8.5 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 232.

   explanations worsening infection or increased inflammatory response
   post procedure.  Pt had relative adrenal insufficiency as he is on
   chronic steroids and wasn
t started on stress dose, so this may have
   also contributed. Hypotension has resolved.  Pt
s anti-HTN had been
   held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the 130s-150s range
   consistently.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, requiring intubation. The patient has been difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation, with initial tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) 5, PEEP 10, and FiO2 40%. He has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for multifocal pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. His current medications include diuretics, pain control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, indicating the possibility of acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes bronchospasm, fluid overload, aspiration, and progression of multifocal pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed infection with two strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This requires continued antibiotic therapy with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin.
3. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient had episodes of hypotension and hypertension, which may be due to infection, increased inflammatory response, or relative adrenal insufficiency. The blood"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   58M with h/o CML, failed Gleevac, s/p HSCT in [**9-22**] complicated by GVHD
   on chronic suppression, history of PE a/w multifocal pneumonia, who
   presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory
   distress that required intubation, now difficult to wean.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Felt to be secondary to components of
   bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
   Also on differential are aspiration and progression of multifocal
   pneumonia. Intubated from noninvasives [**12-20**] resp distress with
   difficulty ventilating and inc work of breathing. Failed SBT
   yesterday.  Still w/ moderate amount of secretions.  Evidence of pulm
   edema on CXR Tolerating PSV 5, PEEP 10, FIO2 40%.  Currently HTNsive
   which could be contributing to pulm edema as pt w/ presumed diastolic
   dysfunction (EF 60%).
   - will switch to PSV 5/5 for SBT today
   - cont tobra and Cipro to tx PNA
   - aggressive diuresis for goal of -1L
   - f/u q6h lytes, replete as necessary
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - on 120 fentanyl,1.5 versed will wean appropriately for SBT tomorrow
   # Pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia with ESBL e.coli in sputum.  BAL
   growing 2 strains of resistant pseudomonas (sensitivities below).  CXR
   w/ improvement of L sided atelectasis.
   - ID: dc [**Last Name (un) 430**] D18 today.
   - ID: cont tobra D3/Cipro D2 for pseudomonas PNA tx, total course 15
   days.
   - if spikes consider adding zosyn to double cover Cipro intermediate
   strain
   - ID: cont vori ppx dosing.
   - cont to f/u WBC and fever curve
   - Cx-ray in AM
   - will repeat tobra peak/trough as previous wasn
t done correctly as
   per ID
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Other possible
   explanations worsening infection or increased inflammatory response
   post procedure.  Pt had relative adrenal insufficiency as he is on
   chronic steroids and wasn
t started on stress dose, so this may have
   also contributed. Hypotension has resolved.  Pt
s anti-HTN had been
   held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the 130s-150s range
   consistently.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.
   - increase metoprolol 50mg TID
   - cont to monitor HR and BP closely
   - f/u CXR in the am
   .
   # Anemia: Pt had 24 hr HCT drop from 27 to 21, Plts 231 -> 187, WBC 9.2
   -> 5.6, on [**6-10**]. Etiology could be hemolysis/DIC vs diluational vs bone
   marrow suppression (pt is on many drugs, and new antibiotics). No
   recent instrumentation/lines placed for RP bleed concern.  Currently
   stable, at 27.3.
   - f/u cbc
   - can CT scan if pt Hct drops
   .
   # Transaminitis: Mild elevation, cont. to trend down, now almost at
   baseline.  MRI liver negative or acute process.
   - will f/u up LFT
   .
   # CML:
   - Cont bactrim, acyclovir and vori for PPX
   - Per primary oncologist
   .
   # History of PE:
   - On lovenox
   .
   # Pain:
   - cont.  fentanyl patch, lidocaine patch

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is currently in the ICU for respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy. The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management.

1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, but this is not mentioned as a direct complication in the progress note.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. The respiratory distress is felt to be secondary to components of bronchospasm, fluid overload in the setting of the procedure, hypertension, aspiration, and progression of multifocal pneumonia. The patient was intubated due to noninvasive respiratory distress with difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) yesterday and still has moderate amounts of secretions. Evidence of pulmonary edema is seen on chest X-ray, and the patient is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with PEEP 10, FiO2 40%. The patient's hypertension could be contributing to pulmonary edema, as the patient has presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%).

3. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive in the setting of antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronchoscopy. Other possible explanations"

   bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
   Also on differential progression of multifocal pneumonia. Intubated
   from noninvasives [**12-20**] resp distress with difficulty ventilating and inc
   work of breathing. Failed SBT on [**6-12**].  Tolerating PSV 5, PEEP 10, FIO2
   40%.  Decreased amount of secretions, fluid status improved, and
   resolution of met alkalosi all positives for successful extubation.
   No gag reflex and possible new infiltrate on CXR could hinder
   successful extubation.
   - SBT for 2 hrs then proceed to extubation to non-invasives.
   - follow serial abgs and monitor resp status closely
   - cont tobra and Cipro to tx PNA
   - f/u lytes am, replete as necessary
   - on 120 fentanyl,1.5 versed will wean appropriately post-extubation
   #RLE rash:  Pt w/ RLE rash that is increasing in size. It is
   erythematous and warm, possibly new cellulitis as pt is prone to skin
   infections becaue of his GVHD.  Pt remains afebrile w/ stable WBC.
   - start vancomycin to cover possible MRSA cellulitis
   - cont to monitor and eval for improvement
   - f/u WBC and fever curve
   # Pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia BAL growing 2 strains of resistant
   pseudomonas (sensitivities above).  CXR w/ possible new infiltrate on
   LLL.  Tobra peak 6.4.
   - cont tobra D3/Cipro D2 for pseudomonas PNA tx, total course 15 days.
   - if spikes, WBC rises consider adding zosyn and dcing Cipro to double
   cover Cipro intermediate pseudomonas strain

   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Hypotension has resolved.
   Pt
s anti-HTN had been held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the
   110s-170s range.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.
   - cont metoprolol 50mg TID
   - cont to monitor HR and BP closely
   - f/u CXR
   #Contraction alkalosis:  Pt w/ contraction alkalosis as a result of
   aggressive diuresis on [**6-13**].  Aggresively repleted lytes, added diamox
   and alkalemia improved.
   - repeat abg to assess acid/base status
   - hold lasix for now
   - finished diamox course
   - cont monitor lytes, replete as necessary
   #Hypernatremia:  Now resolved Na 139.  Currently receiving tube feeds
   w/ free water flushes.
   - increase free water flushes w/ tube feeds to 100mL q4h

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the ICU following a bronchoscopy that resulted in respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient is currently difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, hypertension, and possible progression of multifocal pneumonia. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status, serial ABGs, and close follow-up are recommended.
2. RLE Rash: The patient has an increasing erythematous and warm rash on his right lower extremity, possibly indicating new cellulitis. Vancomycin should be started to cover possible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Regular monitoring and evaluation for improvement are necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with two strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tobramycin and ciprofloxacin should be continued for pseudomonas pneumonia treatment. If spikes in WBC or fever occur, adding meropenem and discontinuing ciprofloxacin may be considered to cover intermediate pseudomonas strain.
4. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was hypotensive initially but has resolved. Now,"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, and has been difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a rash on his right lower extremity (RLE) that is increasing in size, which may indicate a new cellulitis. This could be due to his history of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with bronchospasm, fluid overload, and hypertension during the bronchoscopy, which led to respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. He is now tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with PEEP 10 and FiO2 40%. There is a concern about the possibility of multifocal pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive, but has since resolved. His blood pressure is now in the range of 110s-170s, which may be related to presumed diastolic dysfunction and the use of antihypertensive medications.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. He is being treated with tobramycin and ciprof"

   presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] following bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory
   distress that required intubation, now difficult to wean.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Felt to be secondary to components of
   bronchospasm, fluid overload in setting of procedure and hypertension.
   Also on differential progression of multifocal pneumonia. Intubated
   from noninvasives [**12-20**] resp distress with difficulty ventilating and inc
   work of breathing. Failed SBT on [**6-12**].  Tolerating PSV 5, PEEP 10, FIO2
   40%.  Still w/ large amount of secretions.  Evidence of pulm edema on
   CXR, HTNsive which could be contributing to pulm edema as pt w/
   presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%).
   - switch to [**3-21**] at 830 and try SBT.  Possibly extubation to
   non-[**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 9820**] [**Doctor First Name **].
   - cont tobra and Cipro to tx PNA
   - f/u lytes, replete as necessary
   - aggressive pulmonary toilet
   - on 120 fentanyl,1.5 versed will wean appropriately for SBT tomorrow
   #RLE rash:  Pt w/ RLE rash that is increasing in size. It is
   erythematous and warm, possibly new cellulitis as pt is prone to skin
   infections becaue of his GVHD.  Pt remains afebrile w/ stable WBC.
   - start vancomycin to cover possible MRSA cellulitis
   - cont to monitor and eval for improvement
   - f/u WBC and fever curve
   # Pneumonia: Multifocal pneumonia BAL growing 2 strains of resistant
   pseudomonas (sensitivities above).  CXR w/ improvement of L sided
   atelectasis.  Tobra peak 6.4.
   - cont tobra D3/Cipro D2 for pseudomonas PNA tx, total course 15 days.
   - if spikes, WBC rises consider adding zosyn and dcing Cipro to double
   cover Cipro intermediate pseudomonas strain
   - cont vori ppx dosing.

   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient was hypotensive in the setting of
   antihypertensives and diuresis post-bronch.  Hypotension has resolved.
   Pt
s anti-HTN had been held in setting of hypoTN, but now SBP
s in the
   110s-170s range.  This added to presumed diastolic dysfunction (EF 60%)
   could be contributing to pulm edema and failed SBT.
   - cont metoprolol 50mg TID
   - cont to monitor HR and BP closely
   - f/u CXR
   #Contraction alkalosis:  Pt w/ contraction alkalosis as a result of
   aggressive diuresis on [**6-13**].  Aggresively repleted lytes, added diamox
   and alkalemia improved.
   - repeat abg to assess acid/base status
   - hold lasix for now
   - finished diamox course
   - cont monitor lytes, replete as necessary
   #Hypernatremia:  Now resolved Na 139.  Currently receiving tube feeds
   w/ free water flushes.
   - increase free water flushes w/ tube feeds to 100mL q4h
   - f/u lytes
   .
   # Anemia: Currently stable, at 28.3.
   - f/u cbc
   - can CT scan if pt Hct drops
   .
   # Transaminitis: AST and ALT now almost at baseline.  AP and LDH mildly
   elevated from previous measurement.  Possibly due to GVHD.  MRI liver
   negative or acute process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent stem cell transplantation (SCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presents to the ICU after bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient is currently difficult to wean from mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, hypertension, and possible progression of multifocal pneumonia. He was intubated due to respiratory distress with difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) with PEEP 10 and FiO2 40%. The plan is to perform another SBT for 2 hours before considering extubation to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Close monitoring of respiratory status is required post-extubation.
2. RLE rash: The patient has an erythematous and warm rash on the right lower extremity (RLE) that is increasing in size. It is possibly new cellulitis, especially considering the patient's history of skin infections due to GVHD. Vancomycin has been started to cover possible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis. Monitoring and evaluation for improvement are necessary, along with follow-up of W"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a level of 5 out of 10. The plan is to attempt spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) followed by extubation to non-invasive ventilation. The patient's total output is approximately 2 liters, and the peak concentration of tobramycin is 6.4. The patient also has a rash on the right lower extremity, which is suspected to be cellulitis.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were voriconazole on 06/13/2124 at 06:20 PM, meropenem on 06/13/2124 at 10:20 PM, tobramycin on 06/15/2124 at 02:50 AM, and ciprofloxacin on 06/15/2124 at 06:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving midazolam (Versed) at a rate of 1.5 mg/hour and fentanyl (concentrate) at a rate of 120 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) given on 06/14/2124 at 08:30 AM, midazolam (Versed) given on 06/15/2124 at 01:59 AM, and fentanyl given on 06/15/2124 at 02:00 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned rash. The flowsheet data shows vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's weight is currently 83.4 kg, and height is 67 inches. The central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 9 mmHg.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a mode of CPAP/PSV, tidal volume (Vt) of 580 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 20, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 17 cmH2O, and partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) / fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 183.

Physical examination findings are incomplete as several assessments were not performed. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly low hematocrit (Hct), normal platelet count (Plt), and various electrolyte imbalances. Other lab values show elevated liver enzymes, elevated lactate, low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient is diagnosed with impaired skin integrity, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient presented to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy and required intubation. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pneumonia, impaired skin integrity, hypotension, pain control, and hypernatremia. The pneumonia is caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas, and the patient is being treated with tobramycin and ciprofloxacin. The impaired skin integrity may be due to GVHD, and the patient is at risk for skin infections. The hypotension has resolved, but the patient now has hypertension, possibly related to diastolic dysfunction. Pain control is a concern, as the patient is experiencing persistent abdominal pain that is not well controlled with fentanyl. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement in right lower lobe infiltrates but an increase in opacity in the right upper lobe. 

The patient's plan includes continuing antibiotics for pneumonia, monitoring for skin infection, managing hypertension, providing pain relief, and closely monitoring respiratory status. The patient is currently on noninvasive ventilation and will be followed up with serial"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), failed Gleevac, and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient presents with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy and required intubation. He was previously on noninvasive ventilation but failed spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was placed on mechanical ventilation. He was extubated successfully but then reintubated due to respiratory failure, which was felt to be secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, and hypertension. 

The patient has a history of pneumonia, and bronchoscopy culture grew two strains of resistant pseudomonas. He is currently being treated with Tobramycin and Ciprofloxacin for pseudomonas pneumonia. There is a new infiltrate on the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X-ray, and he will continue to receive Tobramycin and Ciprofloxacin for a total course of 15 days. If there is no improvement, zosyn may be added to cover for an intermediate pseudomonas strain.

The patient also has a rash on the right lower extremity (RLE) that is increasing in size, which could be cellulitis. He is being covered for possible MRSA cellulitis with vancomycin.

The patient was hypotensive initially but now has resolved hypertension. His blood pressure is in the range of"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in 2009. The patient presented to the ICU following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with multifocal pneumonia and is currently being treated for resistant pseudomonas pneumonia.

The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, hypotension, pain control, and possible chronic GVHD. The respiratory failure is secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, and hypertension, and the patient was successfully extubated but with some concerns about the gag reflex and a possible new infiltrate on the chest X-ray.

The patient is being treated with various medications including IVIG, vancomycin, tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, pantoprazole, and morphine PCA for pain control. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated liver enzymes.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with resistant pseudomonas infection. There is a possibility of worsening pneumonia or development of new lung infiltrates.

2. Skin infection: The patient has an increasing erythematous rash on the right lower"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), failed Gleevac therapy, and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient presented to the hospital unit following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress, requiring intubation and subsequent difficult extubation.

The patient's current medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute but not ARDS), hypotension (not in shock), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain). The respiratory failure is believed to be secondary to components of bronchospasm, fluid overload in the setting of the procedure and hypertension, as well as possible progression of multifocal pneumonia. The patient has been intubated since December 20th and failed a spontaneous breathing trial on June 12th. He is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The decision to extubate the patient was made due to improved secretions, fluid status, and resolution of metabolic alkalosis.

The patient also has multifocal pneumonia with two strains of resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa identified in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the ICU with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, which required intubation but was difficult to extubate. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, pneumonia, rheumatoid arthritis-associated rash, pain, hypotension/hypertension, CML/chronic GVHD, history of pulmonary embolism, transaminitis, anemia, contraction alkalosis, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to bronchospasm, fluid overload, hypertension, or progression of multifocal pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Noninvasive ventilation may be required intermittently.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas. Antibiotic treatment with Tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam is ongoing. CXR shows a possible new infiltrate on the left lower lobe. Regular follow-up of the patient's condition and antibiotic therapy is essential.
3. RLE Rash: The patient has an increasing erythematous and warm rash, possibly cellulitis, especially considering his history of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the ICU following a bronchoscopy complicated by respiratory distress, which required intubation. The patient had difficulty being extubated due to bronchospasm, fluid overload, and hypertension. He was ultimately placed on continuous noninvasive ventilation and nebulizers.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, pneumonia, rash caused by RLE, anemia, pain, hypotension/hypertension, and a history of pulmonary embolism (PE). He is currently receiving various treatments including IVIG, Tobramycin, Zosyn, vancomycin, enoxaparin, and methadone for pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has a history of chronic GVHD, which makes him prone to skin infections. The presence of an erythematous and warm rash may indicate new cellulitis.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress after the bronchoscopy and subsequent intubation suggests a possible underlying respiratory condition such as pneumonia or bronchospasm.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas. There is a possible new infiltrate on the left lower lobe seen on the chest X-ray.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), failed Gleevac, and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the hospital following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress, requiring intubation and subsequent difficult extubation. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, possible new infiltrate on chest X-ray, rash on the right lower extremity (RLE), anemia, persistent abdominal pain, and hypertension/hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient may experience further respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, fluid overload, or progression of multifocal pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas. There is a possibility of new infiltrate on the left lower lobe (LLL) on chest X-ray. Treatment with Tobramycin and Zosyn is ongoing, and the patient will need to be monitored for any worsening of symptoms or development of new infiltrates.
3. RLE Rash: The patient has an erythematous and warm rash on the RLE, which could be a sign of cellulitis. Vancomycin levels are adequate, and the treatment plan includes covering possible MRSA cellulitis for a 7-day course.
4. Anemia: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). He presented to the hospital with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy, which required intubation and extubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, pneumonia, anemia, pain, hypertension/hypotension, and hypernatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has multiple echymoses and lesions on his skin, which may indicate impaired skin integrity, possibly due to GVHD.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced acute respiratory failure requiring intubation and had difficulty ventilating. He is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 60% and tolerating it well. Close monitoring of ABG and respiratory status is necessary.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with two strains of resistant pseudomonas identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is receiving IVIG and antibiotic therapy with Tobramycin and Zosyn. Regular follow-up with CXR and WBC/fever curve is required.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has dropped from 29.2 to 25.1 today. No obvious source of bleeding has been identified, but the patient has a history"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) who presented to the hospital with respiratory distress following a bronchoscopy. The patient was intubated due to difficulty ventilating and increased work of breathing, but was successfully extubated after improving fluid status, decreasing secretions, and resolving metabolic alkalosis.

The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (acute), hypotension (not shock), and pain control (acute pain, chronic pain). He also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) associated with multifocal pneumonia and is currently being treated for pneumonia caused by two strains of resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient has received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and is on a combination of tobramycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for antibiotic treatment.

Additionally, the patient has a rash on his right lower extremity (RLE) that is decreasing in size and is possibly new cellulitis, as the patient is prone to skin infections due to GVHD. He is being treated with vancomycin for possible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cellulitis.

The patient also has anemia with a drop in hematocrit (Hct) from 29.2% to 25.1% today,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), failed Gleevac, and subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) complicated by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient presented to the hospital unit following a bronchoscopy that was complicated by respiratory distress requiring intubation, and then difficult extubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, skin integrity issues, anemia, pain, hypotension/hypertension, and history of pulmonary embolism (PE). 

Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced respiratory distress after a bronchoscopy and required intubation. He failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was extubated on day 3. He tolerated high flow oxygen via nasal cannula but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure at 4 am, prompting the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (BiPAP) for a few hours. He was taken off BiPAP around 9 am. Methadone, which he is receiving for pain control, may be contributing to respiratory depression. 

Pneumonia: The patient has multifocal pneumonia with two strains of resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. He is currently receiving tobramycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for pseudomonas pneumonia treatment. His chest X-ray shows worsening opacity in the"

The patient's current ABG results show pH 7.33, PaCO2 64 mmHg, PaO2 103 mmHg, and HCO3- 35 mEq/L. His vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 117/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has a history of pneumonia, which was complicated by the development of two strains of resistant pseudomonas. He is currently receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and antibiotics for pseudomonas pneumonia. 

The patient also has a rash consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is being treated with vancomycin for possible MRSA cellulitis. 

Additionally, the patient has experienced anemia with a drop in hemoglobin from 29.2 to 25.1 today. 

The patient continues to experience persistent abdominal pain that is not well"

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the services provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 9845**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  The patient did well off
   BIPAP until 4am yesterday then was noted to have PC02 of84 and pH of
   7.23 with P02 of 120.  With BIPAP this am his abg
s show: 7.34/59/101,
   quite good for him.  I suspect his hypercarbia last night was due to a
   combination of severe COPD, high dose opiates, hyperoxia with reduction
   in [**Street Address(1) 9846**], fatigue, and the sleep state.  The goal hence
   forth will be to rest him on BIPAP every night and encourage
   spontaneous breathing every day all day, and avoid excess opiates and
   Fio2 (keep sat 95% max).
   His CXR looks worse on the left (?effusion, ?aspiration).  We
ll run
   him negative today and repeat film later.  If equivocal finding I would
   have low threshold for doing a CT of the thorax.
   He needs nutrition and ng tube will interfere with BIPAP. I would
   advance him to full liquids during the day and stop feedings several
   hrs before bedtime BIPAP.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and difficulty ventilating, with a failed spontaneous breathing trial. They were extubated but developed hypercarbic respiratory failure at 4am and were placed on BiPAP 16/5. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.8°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 117/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on high flow nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear lungs to auscultation bilaterally. There are bibasilar crackles present but no wheezes or rhonchi. The patient has a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, and platelet count of 217 K/uL. The blood cultures are positive for two strains of resistant pseudomonas. The patient has been started on Tobramycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for pseudomonas pneumonia treatment. 

The patient's pain is reasonably controlled with IV methadone, but they still experience persistent abdominal pain. The patient's hypertension and hypotension have improved with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The patient presented to the ICU with respiratory distress after a bronchoscopy, requiring intubation and subsequent difficult extubation. He was initially diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to bronchospasm, fluid overload, and hypertension, as well as multifocal pneumonia. The patient's respiratory distress was initially managed with noninvasive ventilation (NIV) but progressed to the need for endotracheal intubation.

The patient's current status shows that he is tolerating high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and does not require bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) support. He is receiving intravenous methadone for pain control, which may contribute to respiratory depression. The plan is to continue nasal cannula support as tolerated and monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels between 90-92%.

Regarding pneumonia, the patient has two strains of resistant pseudomonas growing from a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). He is currently receiving tobramycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for pneumonia treatment. The chest X-ray (CXR) shows increased right lower lung field haziness but no significant changes compared to the previous day.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is currently experiencing multiple medical complications.

The patient presents with impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension (not shock), and pain control issues. He also has a history of pneumonia, which has led to the growth of two strains of resistant pseudomonas bacteria in his lungs. The patient is being treated with Tobramycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for the pneumonia.

The patient's pain is not well-controlled with fentanyl, so the methadone interval has been increased to every six hours, and the fentanyl patch has been decreased to 300 mcg.

The patient's hemoglobin level is stable at 27.0, and there are no signs of hemolysis. However, the patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated.

The patient's blood pressure has improved from previous measurements, but he still requires antihypertensive medication. His heart rate and rhythm are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and is receiving immunosuppressive therapy. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics, antiviral medication, and has been started on vancomycin for possible MRSA cellulitis on his right lower extremity. The rash is decreasing"
