   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of chronic alcohol abuse, currently presenting with acute intoxication and at risk for withdrawal and delirium tremens (DTs). The patient has received thiamine, MVI, and folate and will be maintained on Valium per CIWA scale. Close monitoring for worsening withdrawal symptoms is recommended.

The patient also has hand swelling of unclear etiology, with no fractures detected on X-ray. This may be related to prior heroin abuse. The patient's hand and leg pain are chronic in nature and will be managed with Neurontin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen.

The patient is experiencing acidosis with an anion gap, attributed to alcohol consumption and starvation ketosis. Ongoing monitoring of the osmolar gap is advised, and an evaluation is in progress.

Due to chronic alcohol abuse, the patient is hypovolemic with diuresis and poor oral intake. Fluid repletion is ongoing, including consideration of an IV fluid bolus. Once repleted, the femoral central line can be discontinued.

The patient has tachycardia secondary to anxiety, on the background of baseline tachycardia while awake.

Renal function is improving with IV hydration, and urine output should be closely monitored. Nutritional support should encourage oral intake.

In terms of ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and lines management are being addressed. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prevention and deep"

   several ICU admissions for management alchohol withdrawl in the past,
   HCV, and HBV, admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for alcohol withdrawal.
   .
   #. Alcolism/Alcohol withdrawal: No evidence of withdrawal at this time.
   No anion gap.
   -folate, thiamine, MVI
   -d/c diazepam
   -f/u SW recs
   -f/u psych recs
   -fluids PRN
   .
   # Hand pain: Questionable finger fracture on x-ray, although this
   location does not correspond particularly well to pt's symptoms.
   - For now will control pain without narcotics- will tx w/ motrin and
   acetaminophen
   .
   #. Peripheral neuropathy: Attributed in the past to EtOH abuse. Recent
   folate and B12 within normal limits. No hx of diabetes. Will control
   pain with analgesics for now; consider more definitive therapy when
   acute issues resolved.
   - tx w/ gabapentin and thiamine, as per alcoholic neuropathy
   .
   #. Pancytopenia: Likely [**3-11**] EtOHism. DDX of thrombocytopenia includes
   HIT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old male with severe alcoholism and a history of multiple ICU admissions for alcohol withdrawal, HCV, and HBV. He was admitted to the ICU for alcohol withdrawal. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 115/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has intermittent apnea attributed to Valium use. He has mild diffuse bilateral hand swelling and mild diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen. The patient is anxious and upset about not receiving more sedating medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient has a history of severe alcoholism and previous ICU admissions for alcohol withdrawal. There is a risk of recurrent alcohol withdrawal symptoms, which can lead to complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.
2. Thiamine deficiency: Chronic alcoholism can lead to thiamine deficiency, which can cause complications like Wernicke's encephalopathy and beriberi.
3. Peripheral neuropathy: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, and his peripheral neuropathy is attributed to this. It may worsen over time if not properly managed.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. This could be due to alcohol-related bone marrow suppression or other causes"

   EtOH ABUSE -- acute intoxication, at risk for withdrawal and DTs.
   Received Thiamine/MVI/Folate.  Clinically improved.  Medically stable
   for transfer to medical [**Hospital1 **].
   HAND SWELLING -- Unclear etiology.  No fracture by X-Ray.  Possibly
   related to prior Heroin abuse.  Monitor exam.  Consider Rheumatology or
   Dermatology consultation.
   HAND PAIN / LEG PAIN
 Chronic.  Continue Neurontin, ibuprofen,
   acetominophen.
   ACIDOSIS -- anion gap.  Attributed to EtOH and starvation ketosis.
   Continue to monitor osmolar gap.  Evaluation in progress.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia (chronic EtOH abuse with diuresis), poor PO
   intake.  Plan continue to replete, consider iv fluid bolus.  Femoral
   central line in place --> hope to d/c once repleted.
   TACHYCARDIA -- anxiety on background of baseline tachycardia while
   awake.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- improved urine output with iv hydration.  Monitor
   urine output,
   BUN, Creatinine.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage PO.

","Summary:
The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of chronic EtOH abuse, currently presenting with acute intoxication and at risk for withdrawal. The patient has been medically stabilized and is now medically stable for transfer to another hospital. He complains of hand pain, stomach pain, and neuropathy in his legs, which are chronic symptoms. The patient also expresses a desire to enroll in a rehabilitation program.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. EtOH withdrawal: Given the patient's history of chronic EtOH abuse and current intoxication, there is a risk of withdrawal symptoms, which can include tremors, seizures, hallucinations, and delirium tremens (DTs).
2. Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to EtOH and starvation ketosis. Monitoring the osmolar gap and evaluating in progress is important to manage this condition.
3. Fluid imbalance: The patient has hypovolemia secondary to chronic EtOH abuse and poor oral intake. Repletion with intravenous fluids is necessary, and consideration should be given to discontinuing the femoral central line once repleted.
4. Renal function: The patient's renal function has improved with IV hydration, but ongoing monitoring of urine output, BUN, and creatinine is required.
5. Nutritional support: Encouraging oral intake is crucial for the patient's nutritional support, as he has been NPO (nothing by mouth) for some time.

   Assessment and Plan
   37 yom chronic EtOH abuse and now with actue intoxication --> at risk
   for withdrawal.
   EtOH ABUSE -- acute intoxication, at risk for withdrawal and DTs.
   Received Thiamine/MVI/Folate.  Maintain Valium per CIWA scale.  Monitor
   for worsening withdrawl symptoms.
   HAND SWELLING -- Unclear etiology.  No fracture by X-Ray.  Possibly
   related to prior Heroin abuse.  Monitor exam.  Consider Rheumatology or
   Dermatology consultation.
   HAND PAIN / LEG PAIN
 Chronic.  Continue Neurontin, ibuprofen,
   acetominophen.
   ACIDOSIS -- anion gap.  Attributed to EtOH and starvation ketosis.
   Continue to monitor osmolar gap.  Evaluation in progress.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia (chronic EtOH abuse with diuresis), poor PO
   intake.  Plan continue to replete, consider iv fluid bolus.  Femoral
   central line in place --> hope to d/c once repleted.
   TACHYCARDIA -- anxiety on background of baseline tachycardia while
   awake.
   RENAL FUNCTION -- improving urine output with iv hydration.  Monitor
   urine output,
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- encourage PO.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 37-year-old male with a history of chronic ethanol (EtOH) abuse presenting with acute intoxication and withdrawal symptoms. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 117/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is alert and oriented, with normal neurologic examination findings. 

The patient has hand swelling without erythema or warmth, which may be related to prior heroin abuse. He complains of chronic hand and leg pain, for which he is currently taking Neurontin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen. Laboratory results show an anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to EtOH and starvation ketosis. The patient is hypovolemic and receiving intravenous fluids, and his renal function is improving. 

The patient's nutritional support is being encouraged through oral intake, and he is being monitored for glycemic control and lines care. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots. The patient's code status is full code, and he is planned for transfer to the floor once stabilized. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. EtOH Withdrawal Syndrome: The patient is at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms due to chronic EtOH abuse and acute intoxication. Monitoring for worsening withdrawal"
