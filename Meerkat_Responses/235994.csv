   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He is now in the MICU due to hypotension and fevers. The patient has a history of prior endocarditis and reports experiencing low blood pressure, particularly after hemodialysis sessions. His current vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/52 mmHg to 115/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including heparin sodium, clindamycin, linezolid, vancomycin, gentamicin, and others. Further assessments and plans include ruling out infectious etiology for back pain, obtaining an MRI of the lumbar spine, monitoring blood cultures, continuing antibiotic therapy, checking CRP and ESR levels, evaluating cardiac function, and managing hypertension and ESRD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with hypotension and fevers raises concern for sepsis, especially considering his history of prior endocarditis. This condition requires prompt recognition and management to prevent further complications.
2. Infection: The patient's back pain and fever could indicate an underlying infection, which needs to be ruled out through appropriate diagnostic tests such as MRI"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and fevers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 63/52 mmHg to 79/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient has a history of prior endocarditis and has shown signs of being fluid responsive. He is currently receiving multiple medications including linezolid, clindamycin, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid, among other abnormalities. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever suggest the possibility of sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.
2. Endocarditis: Given the patient's history of prior endocarditis, there is a concern for potential recurrence or involvement of the heart valves in the current illness.
3. Infected thrombi or epidural abscess: The patient's back pain and tenderness along the sacrum"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He is now in the MICU due to hypotension and fevers. The patient has a history of prior endocarditis and is currently on dialysis three times a week. He has several medical conditions, including sepsis with GPCs in multiple blood cultures, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and cardiac issues such as atherosclerosis in the coronary vessels, global hypokinesis with an EF of 45%, diastolic dysfunction, moderate aortic regurgitation, worsening of AR, sinus tachycardia, and well-controlled hypertension.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade bacteremia with 10/12 blood cultures positive for GPCs. This indicates a severe infection that can lead to sepsis. Appropriate antibiotics and source control measures should be implemented promptly.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, which can compromise organ perfusion and lead to multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Close monitoring and appropriate hemodynamic support are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has nearly halved since admission, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Further evaluation for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) should be conducted.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as evidenced by global hypokinesis, EF of 45%, diastolic dysfunction, and worsening aortic regurgitation. These issues require close monitoring and appropriate management, including medication adjustments and consideration for cardiac interventions if indicated.
5. Endocarditis: The patient's history of prior endocarditis and current fevers and back pain raise concerns for possible endocarditis. Imaging studies and blood cultures should be conducted to rule out this condition.
6. ESRD: The patient's underlying ESRD requires ongoing management, including dialysis sessions and medication adjustments to maintain electrolyte balance and control other complications associated with renal failure.
7. Other complications: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other ICU-acquired conditions. Prophylactic measures should be implemented as appropriate."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He was transferred to the MICU due to hypotension and fevers. The patient has a history of prior endocarditis and currently presents with high-grade bacteremia, with 10 out of 12 blood cultures positive for Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The patient is allergic to penicillins and shellfish.

The patient received an MRI of the spine without gadolinium, which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. However, the pain symptoms are consistent with radiculopathy visualized on the scan. A transthoracic echo was performed, which showed no evidence of vegetations.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.2°F (39°C), current temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 78-122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/61mmHg to 126/95mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received multiple doses of antibiotics, including linezolid, clindamycin, daptomycin, gentamicin, and vancom"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension with fevers. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 102.2°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 103/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with low sodium, potassium, and glucose levels. 

The patient has a history of cardiovascular disease, including aortic valve regurgitation and previous endocarditis. He also has a history of chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis three times a week. 

The assessment and plan include the following:
- Sepsis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin and gentamicin for suspected sepsis.
- Hypotension: The patient's baseline low blood pressure, especially after hemodialysis, is a concern. However, given the clinical picture of back pain and fevers, sepsis is a possible cause.
- Back pain: The patient has persistent back pain, which is tender along the sacrum and lower back. It is important to rule out an infectious etiology, especially considering his history of prior end"

","The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He has now been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and fevers. The patient has high-grade bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPC) and persistent fever, which has resolved the hypotension except during hemodialysis (HD) yesterday. He will continue receiving vancomycin and gentamicin with HD. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed to assess for possible endocarditis given his valve history.

The patient also presents with persistent back pain that has lasted for multiple days, tenderness along the sacrum, and no compromise of the spinal cord. However, considering the fevers and history of prior endocarditis, an infectious etiology needs to be ruled out. An MRI of the lumbar spine was performed last night, which did not show any signs of epidural abscess. No further imaging is needed as discussed with the pain control team.

The patient has a history of cardiac issues, specifically mitral valve regurgitation (moderate AR), and there is concern that it has worsened. The patient underwent cardiac MRI last week, and a TEE will be conducted today to assess valve function and check for vegetations.

In addition, the patient has ESRD and requires dialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays"

","Summary:
The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who was admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He is now in the MICU due to hypotension and fevers. The patient has high-grade bacteremia caused by GPC bacteria. He continues to have persistent fever and his blood pressure remains unstable except during hemodialysis yesterday. The patient underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to assess for possible endocarditis, given his history of valve issues. 

The patient's back pain has been persistent for multiple days, tender along the sacrum, and also along the musculature of the low back and gluteals. There is no evidence of cord compromise. However, considering his fevers and history of prior endocarditis, it is necessary to rule out an infectious etiology. An MRI of the lumbar spine was performed last night, which did not show any overt epidural abscess, and further imaging is not needed as discussed with the pain control team.

The patient's cardiac condition includes valves with moderate aortic regurgitation (AR), and there are concerns that AR has worsened. The patient underwent cardiac MRI last week, and a TEE was performed today to assess valve function and check for vegetations.

In terms of the patient's ESRD, he requires dialysis on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, followed by Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 2759]. He should continue taking Renal and Fosrenal, and appreciate any renal recommendations. 

ICU care includes nutrition (NPO for TEE), glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain.
- Transferred to the MICU due to hypotension with fevers and high-grade bacteremia.
- Fever spikes without acute issues.
- Allergies include penicillins, shellfish, and an unknown allergy causing shortness of breath.
- Last doses of antibiotics were administered on 09/14/2163 at various times.
- Currently receiving multiple IV medications, including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), vit B, lanthanum, renagel, Lipitor, ASA 162, lidocain patch, and Tylenol.
- Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for continued back pain.
- Vital signs: max temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), current temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 83 bpm (78-122 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 109/77 mmHg to 126/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute (9-21 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- Physical examination findings include sinus rhythm, right regular rate and rhythm with S1-S2 +SEM and diastolic EM, soft abdomen, no focal point tenderness, no weakness or sensory deficits in bilateral lower extremities, and a fistula for chronic dialysis.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelets, and creatinine levels, as well as electrolyte imbalances and elevated D-dimer level.
- Assessment and plan include:
   #1) Hypotension likely due to sepsis, with potential sources such as endocarditis, infected thrombi, or epidural abscess. Consider fistula as a source and perform further investigations.
   #2) Persistent back pain without evidence of cord compromise. Rule out infectious etiology given fevers and history of prior endocarditis.
   #3) Thrombocytopenia with negative disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Consider heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and consult a hematologist.
   #4) Cardiac valves with worsening aortic regurgitation (AR). Continue current management and follow-up with cardiac MRI findings.
   #5) ESRD with ongoing dialysis treatment on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Continue renal medications and follow-up with renal team.

Potential Medical Complications:
- Sepsis due to high-grade bacteremia.
- Endocarditis, particularly considering the patient's history of prior endocarditis.
- Infected thrombi or epidural abscess.
- Thrombocytopenia, potentially due to DIC or HIT.
- Worsening aortic regurgitation.
- Complications related to ESRD and dialysis treatment."

   33 yo male with ESRD admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain, now
   transferred to MICU in setting of hypotension w/ fevers and high grade
   bacteremia.
   #1) Hypotension: likely sepsis given fevers after HD and fluid
   responsive, Sources
 endocarditis, infected thrombi, epidural abcess
   ruled out, consider fistula as source consider US/MRI F/u bld cx; con't
   vanc/gent w/ HD (will check vanc level) and random Gent level if pt
   con't to [**Last Name (LF) 1694**], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**] consider adding VRE coverage- TEE pending:
   endocarditis given valve hx- needs CXR this AM
   #2) Back pain- Persistent for multi days.  Tender along sacrum (though
   also along musculature of low back & gluteals).  No s/o cord
   compromise.  However, given fevers & h/o prior endocarditis, need to

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 33-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) admitted for uncontrolled acute low back pain. He has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension and high-grade bacteremia. The patient's fever spikes have been documented, and the source of bacteremia is unclear at this time.

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, current temperature of 98.3 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate between 78-122 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 84/50 mmHg to 126/95 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,242 mL, including 97 mL of IV fluids. The patient has received 660 mL of oral fluids, 582 mL of IV fluids, and 150 mL of blood products. Total output includes 150 mL of urine and 97 mL of other losses. The patient's respiratory support includes SpO2 of 98% and an ABG result of //26/.

The patient's laboratory results show hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, white blood cell count of 6.9 K/uL, platelet count of 86 K/uL, creatinine of 11.4 mg/dL, glucose of 78 mg/dL, and other labs including PT/PTT/INR, differential, fibrinogen, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and D-dimer.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Hypotension: likely sepsis given fevers after HD and fluid responsive. Sources of infection such as endocarditis, infected thrombi, and epidural abscess have been ruled out. Consider fistula as a potential source. Follow-up blood culture is recommended, and continue vancomycin and gentamicin with hemodialysis. Check vancomycin and gentamicin levels.
2) Back pain: persistent for multiple days. Tender along the sacrum and musculature of the low back and gluteals. No evidence of cord compromise. However, given fevers and history of prior endocarditis, need to rule out infectious etiology. MRI of the lumbar spine was performed last night, which did not show any overt epidural abnormality.
3) Thrombocytopenia: DIC negative. Will check for HIT and consider a heme consult.
4) Cardiac valves: moderate aortic regurgitation. Concern that AR has worsened. Cardiac MRI is recommended. Dr. [Last Name] is aware of the findings. Continue current management, follow-up MRI findings, and likely TEE if negative. Hold antihypertensive medications.
5) ESRD: dialysis three times a week"
