","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and cocaine abuse. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient's DKA is unclear in etiology. The leading diagnosis is noncompliance with insulin. Infectious causes have been generally ruled out with negative cultures and chest X-ray. The right foot remains a possible source of infection. The patient should continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement as D5, with bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia. The diet should be advanced as tolerated, and electrolytes should be rechecked regularly, replenishing as needed.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient has new-onset abdominal pain this morning. The abdomen is benign, and the differential diagnosis includes gastroparesis, anxiety. Liver function tests (LFTs), amylase, and lipase are within normal limits. Pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan can be continued.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient likely has ARF due to profound dehydration, which is improving with intravenous fluids (IVF). Aggressive volume resuscitation should continue with the aforementioned"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Lastname 765] is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a history of cocaine abuse. She was admitted to the MICU for altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history also includes coronary artery disease with biventricular systolic dysfunction, chronic pain, anxiety/depression, chronic anemia, hepatitis B, and previous right femoral bypass surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient is currently being managed for DKA with insulin infusion, fluid resuscitation, and monitoring of blood sugar levels. It is important to continue close monitoring of her respiratory status due to her history of bisystolic dysfunction.
2. ARF: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely a result of profound dehydration. Aggressive volume resuscitation and continued nephrocaps are recommended to support renal function.
3. Cocaine abuse: The patient's urine toxic screen is positive for cocaine, indicating ongoing cocaine abuse. It is important to hold her home regimen of metoprolol and discuss the potential dangers of beta-blockers in this patient with her primary care physician (PCP).
4. Type 1 DM: Once the patient is stabilized, she will be initiated on her home regimen of insulin. Her blood pressure needs to be stable before restarting her chronic"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: unclear source, possibly medication non-compliance vs.
   infection.  No signs of cardiac ischemia.  Leukocytosis may be real or
   hemoconcentration, as all cell lines are elevated.  UA and CXR are
   non-focal, only possible infectious source is her right foot.
   -Liberal volume resuscitation with isotonic fluid (NS), likely needs
   7-10% of body weight repleted.  Will watch respiratory status closely
   given h/o bisystolic dysfunction.
   -Insulin infusion at 5-6units/hr (0.1units/kg/hr) until blood sugar
   normalizes and anion gap closes, will avoid >100unit decrements/hour.
   -Will monitor q2H pH, electrolytes, and q1H FSBS
   -Add 5% dextrose to fluids when BS <250 to allow for insulin gtt to
   infuse
   -Stop insulin/dextrose when BS <250, and anion gap closes, and provide
   home dose of SC 75/25 insulin dose.
   -Add potassium to repletion fluids once <4.5
   -Re-check a set of cardiac enzymes at 12H, f/u infectious w/u
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: [**Month (only) 51**] be real, or a result of hemoconcentration, as all
   cell lines are up, and trending down with fluids.  Possible source
   would be her gangrenous right foot.
   -Follow up blood and urine cultures, repeat UA, and follow up CXR read
   -No signs of active infection at the moment, vancomycin should stay on
   board given renal function.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely a result of profound dehydration, as
   evidenced by BUN/Cr ratio >20 in the setting of DKA.
   -Continue aggressive volume resuscitation as above
   -Continue nephrocaps
   -Renally dose all meds
   .
   #. Cocaine abuse: Urine tox screen is positive for cocaine, prior OMR
   notes indicate that this is an ongoing problem.
   -Hold home regimen of metoprolol, and will discuss possible dangers of
   beta blockers in this patient with PCP
   [**Name9 (PRE) **] consult on the floor
   .
   #. Type 1 DM:
   -Manage DKA as above, will initiate home regimen of insulin once
   stabilized.
   -Continue ASA ppx
   .
   #. CAD with biventriuclar systolic dysfunction
   -Will monitor closely during volume resuscitation for signs of hypoxia
   -Hold BB and lisinopril as above
   -Continue ASA PPX
   -Will order echocardiogram in AM to assess EF, as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 669**] planned to
   obtain one in his recent note.
   .
   #. Chronic Pain
   -Continue home regimen of oxycodone once blood pressure is stable, and
   mental status clears
   .
   #. Anxiety/depression
   -continue home regimen of clonazepam and lorazapam once blood pressure
   is stable and mental status clears
   .
   #. Chronic anemia: Baseline 25-30, currently [**Last Name (LF) 6052**], [**First Name3 (LF) **]
   monitor with daily labs.
   .
   #. Hepatitis B: stable, no active issues.
   .
   #. PVD: Will let Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2494**] know of her admission.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 38F with type 1 DM, severe PVD s/p recent right femoral
   bypass, and cocaine abuse, presenting with altered mental status,
   leukocytosis, ARF, and DKA.
   .
   #. DKA: Pt
s gap closed as of yesterday morning. However pt missed AM
   dose of long acting 75/25 (15u), and gap opened up in evening up to 20,
   currently 17.  Overnight BS mostly 100-200, and regular insulin without
   successful closure of gap. Cause of re-opening of gap likely from
   insufficient insulin over the day. [**Month (only) 51**] have other sourse of AG, lactate
   stable. No meds contributing.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 38-year-old female with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post recent right femoral bypass, and cocaine abuse. She presents with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure (ARF), and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has several ongoing medical issues:

1. DKA: The etiology of DKA is unclear, but noncompliance with insulin is the leading diagnosis. Infectious causes have been ruled out with negative cultures and chest X-ray. The right foot remains a possible source of infection. The patient should continue aggressive maintenance fluids including sugar replacement, as D5 3amps of bicarb may be contributing to hypoglycemia. She should be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated, with recheck of evening electrolytes and repletion as needed.

2. Abdominal Pain: The patient experienced new-onset abdominal pain this morning after the examination. The abdomen is benign. Differential diagnoses include gastroparesis, anxiety. LFTs, amylase, and lipase are within normal limits. Pain management with home hydrocodone and home ativan can be continued.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure is likely due to profound dehydration, which is improving with IV fluids. She should continue aggressive volume resuscitation,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 38-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus, severe peripheral vascular disease, and a history of cocaine abuse. She presented with altered mental status, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood glucose levels were initially high but have been mostly stable overnight. However, the gap in blood sugar levels has re-opened due to insufficient insulin. The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is experiencing abdominal pain. Her acute renal failure has resolved, and her creatinine level is now at 1.0. The patient also has a history of anxiety/depression, chronic pain, and hepatitis B. She underwent a recent right femoral bypass surgery and is currently unable to tolerate oral feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. DKA: The patient's blood sugar levels are still not well controlled, and the gap has re-opened. It is crucial to continue insulin therapy and monitor the patient's blood sugar levels closely to prevent further complications related to DKA.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, putting her at risk for complications such as heart attack, stroke, or organ damage. It is important to start antihypertensive medication and closely monitor her blood pressure.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's abdominal pain may be related to DKA or another underlying condition. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and provide appropriate"
