","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The patient's rhythm has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, but showed a good response to lopressor 10mg IV. 

The assessment and plan include:
1. Atrial Flutter: His atrial flutter may have begun nearly two weeks ago when he first developed cough and increased abdominal girth. His rhythm has so far been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol. Placed on diltiazem drip overnight with minimal results. He received lopressor 10mg IV overnight with good response. TEE and ablation today.
2. Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure: Appears to be predominantly right-sided heart failure with absence of crackles, and presence of JVP, abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth. Echo at outside hospital with LVH and LVEF of 10%. BNP elevated here with troponin leak. Etiologies may include cardiomyopathy induced by alcohol, viral infection from previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.
3. Hypertension: Currently on lopressor 25mg PO TID. Add lisinopril 5mg daily today. Consider toprol XL on discharge.
4. Coronary artery disease prevention: Aspirin 81mg. Consider checking lipid profile if PCP has not already checked.
5. FEN: NPO past midnight for TEE/ablation today.
6. ACCESS: PIV X2.
7. PROPHYLAXIS: DVT ppx with heparin gtt. Pain management with bowel regimen colace, senna.
8. CODE: Full code.
9. DISPO: CCU for now.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure due to inadequate treatment or non-compliance with medication regimen.
2. Development of further arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
3. Pulmonary edema if fluid overload occurs.
4. Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and use of heparin.
5. Infection due to indwelling lines or catheters.
6. Hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia if glycemic control is not maintained properly.
7. Stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding due to stress ulcer prophylaxis.
8. Ventilator-associated pneumonia due to prolonged intubation.
9. Renal insufficiency or acute kidney injury due to dehydration or use of nephrotoxic drugs.

The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration or complications, and appropriate interventions should be made promptly."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with no past medical history presenting with new-onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The patient's heart rhythm has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, so an electrophysiology consult has been ordered. 

The patient's acute systolic congestive heart failure appears to be predominantly right-sided, as evidenced by the absence of crackles, presence of jugular venous distention (JVP), abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth. An echocardiogram at an outside hospital revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%. Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated, and there is troponin leak. Possible etiologies include alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, viral infection from a previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. 

Further management includes administration of furosemide (Lasix) 20mg IV, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), cardiac enzyme monitoring, and consideration of cardiac catheterization. 

Additionally, the patient has been started on diltiazem for hypertension and aspirin for coronary artery disease prevention. The patient's fluid intake and output have been documented, as well as daily weights. Prophylactic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no past medical history, presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The patient's rhythm has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, but showed a good response to lopressor 10mg IV overnight. The patient is planned for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and ablation today. Medications include lopressor 25mg PO BID, ablation today, TTE and TEE today, heparin IV, and follow-up with electrophysiology recommendations. The patient also has acute systolic congestive heart failure, predominantly right-sided heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 10% and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Possible etiologies include alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, viral infection from a previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Treatment for heart failure includes lasix 20mg IV X1 overnight, monitoring urine output, and performing a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and TEE today. The patient is also being treated for hypertension, with lopressor 25mg PO TID, and lisinopril 5mg daily today. Aspirin 81mg is prescribed for coronary artery disease prevention, and the patient's lipid profile should be checked if the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He was loaded with digoxin and started on metoprolol, which resulted in a decrease in heart rate from the 130s to ranging from 80s-120s. The patient has a history of atrial flutter and is currently on Coumadin (warfarin). He is also hypertensive, with blood pressure readings ranging from 128/75 to 175/145 mmHg. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.6°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving fluids through various routes, including IVF and TF, and has received a total of 1,500 mL of blood products. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and increased troponin-T levels. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the lungs, and he is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial flutter and elevated troponin-T levels indicate possible cardiac damage, which may lead to further arrhythmias.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no prior medical history who presented with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. He has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, but showed a good response to lopressor 10mg IV overnight. The patient is scheduled for transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and ablation today. He is currently on metoprolol 50 mg qid, digoxin 250 mg q6 loading, heparin IV, and Lasix 20mg IV X1 overnight. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 128/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals a well-nourished individual in no acute distress, with a supple neck and jugular venous pulse up to the angle of the jaw. Cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with normal S1 and S2 sounds, no murmurs, regurgitation, or gallops, and no S3 or S4. Lung examination is unremarkable, with no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and no crack"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with no previous medical history presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. The patient's rhythm has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, but responded well to lopressor 10mg IV overnight. The patient underwent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and ablation today. The patient is currently on metoprolol 50 mg qid, digoxin 250 mg q6 loading, and heparin IV. Follow-up with Electrophysiology recommendations is planned, along with outpatient coumadin.

The patient appears to have predominantly right-sided heart failure, as evidenced by the absence of crackles, presence of jugular venous distension (JVP), abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth. An echo at an outside hospital revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels are elevated here, along with troponin leak. Possible etiologies for the acute systolic congestive heart failure include alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, viral infection from a previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.

The patient's hypertension is currently being managed with lopressor 25mg PO TID. Lisinopril 5mg daily will be added today, and consideration will be given to metoprolol XL on discharge. The patient is also on aspirin 81mg for coronary artery disease prevention, and a lipid profile will be considered if the primary care physician (PCP) has not already checked it.

The patient is NPO past midnight for TEE/ablation today. Two peripheral IV (PIV) lines have been placed. Prophylaxis includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with heparin gtt, pain management, and a bowel regimen of colace and senna. The patient's code status is full code.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no significant medical history who presented with new-onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. He has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, so he has been placed on a diltiazem drip with minimal results. His current medications include metoprolol 75 mg q6h, verapamil 60 mg q12h, heparin IV, and Coumadin as an outpatient. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate in the 80s-100s, blood pressure around 122/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Physical examination shows no chest wall deformities or scoliosis, but the patient does have soft, obese, distended abdomen with pitting edema and bilateral 2+ pitting edema in the extremities. Lab results indicate elevated BNP and troponin leak, with an ejection fraction of 10% on echo.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening congestive heart failure: The patient's symptoms of right-sided heart failure, such as JVP, abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth, suggest ongoing or worsening congestive heart failure. Close monitoring of fluid balance, respiratory status, and electrolyte levels is essential.

2. Atrial flutter: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no prior medical history presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. He has been unresponsive to diltiazem and metoprolol. He is currently on verapamil for rate control and has shown good response. He has had two pauses for several seconds while bearing down to pass gas. He also has evidence of right-sided heart failure with JVP, abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth. His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is 10%, and his B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated with troponin leak. Possible etiologies for his heart failure include alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, viral infection from a previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He is being monitored closely in the CCU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's systolic congestive heart failure could progress, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Arrhythmias: Given the patient's history of atrial flutter, there is a risk of developing other arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, which can be life-threatening.
3. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to his hospital stay, especially considering the indwelling lines and the immunosup"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with no prior medical history presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block. He has been unresponsive to diltiazem and metoprolol for his atrial flutter, so verapamil was added with good subsequent rate control. The patient's rate has remained in the 80s-100s since 1:30 PM. He had another long pause with passing gas yesterday evening. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 122/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. His physical examination reveals a supple neck with jugular venous distention up to the angle of the jaw, a point of maximum impulse located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, and no murmurs or gallops. His lungs are clear, and he has 2+ pitting edema bilaterally in his extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated BUN and creatinine levels, as well as elevated troponin-T and CK levels. The patient's blood cultures, urinalysis, and ABG results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with no pmh presenting with new onset systolic congestive heart
   failure and atrial flutter with 2:1 block.
   .
   # Atrial Flutter: His atrial flutter may have begun nearly two weeks
   ago when he first developed cough and increased abdominal girth. His
   rhythm has so far been resistent to diltiazem and metoprolol.  Placed
   on dilt drip with minimal results.  Was mostly in 4:1 block overnight.
   -change metoprolol (tartrate) to 150mg q12 (from 75 mg q6 hrs)
   -d/c
d digoxin [**9-12**] given his pauses
   -add verapamil 60 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-12**] with good subsequent rate control
   -heparin IV
   -f/u Electrophysiology recs
   -Lovenox as bridge to coumadin as an outpatient (INR trending up)
   -Has had 2 pauses for several seconds while bearing down to pass gas.
   -outpatient TEE and ablation
   .
   # Acute Systolic Congestive heart failure:  Appears to be predominantly
   right sided heart failure with absence of crackles, and presence of
   JVP, abdominal edema and increased abdominal girth.  Echo at Outside
   hospital with LVH and LVEF of 10%. BNP elevated here with troponin
   leak. Etiologies may include cardiomyopathy induced by alcohol, viral
   infection from previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia
   induced cardiomyopathy.
   -monitor UOP
   .
   #Hypertension: Increased to metoprolol 75 mg q6
   -added lisinopril 5mg [**9-12**]
   -consider toprol XL on discharge
   .
   # Coronary artery disease prevention: aspirin 81mg.
   -Consider checking lipid profile if PCP has not already checked.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with no significant past medical history. He presented with new onset systolic congestive heart failure and atrial flutter with a 2:1 block. The patient's rhythm has been resistant to diltiazem and metoprolol, so he was placed on a diltiazem drip with minimal results. His metoprolol was changed to 150mg q12, digoxin was discontinued, and verapamil 60mg was added with good subsequent rate control. The patient is also on heparin IV, with plans for follow-up electrophysiology recommendations, Lovenox as a bridge to coumadin as an outpatient (INR trending up), and outpatient TEE and ablation.

The patient appears to have predominantly right-sided heart failure, as evidenced by the absence of crackles, presence of jugular venous distention (JVP), abdominal edema, and increased abdominal girth. An echocardiogram at an outside hospital revealed left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 10%. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is elevated here, along with troponin leak. Possible etiologies for the acute systolic congestive heart failure include alcohol-induced cardiomyopathy, viral infection from a previous upper respiratory infection, or tachycardia-induced cardiomy"
