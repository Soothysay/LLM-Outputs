   Disposition:
","The patient is an 79-year-old female with a past medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and hypertension (HTN). The patient presented with bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 32% to 26%. The differential diagnosis for lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed includes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), colon cancer, and hemorrhoidal bleeding. However, this presentation is most likely consistent with diverticulosis, as confirmed by a colonoscopy performed in [**2120**].

The patient has been managed with the following plan:
1. NPO with gentle intravenous fluids (IVF) at 75cc/hr.
2. Transfuse with a goal hemoglobin concentration of 30% due to the acute drop.
3. Two large peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines.
4. GI scope tomorrow if the patient continues to drop hemoglobin concentration.
5. Maintain active temperature and blood pressure monitoring.
6. Monitor urine output.
7. Follow-up hemoglobin concentration every six hours.

Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI) with a Gram-negative rod (GNR) in the urine culture, which is being treated with Ciprofloxacin for three days.

The patient's medications have been adjusted due to the active lower GI bleed, including holding aspirin and clo"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, bradycardia, and coronary artery disease. The patient required blood transfusions due to bloody bowel movements and has received treatment for a urinary tract infection. Vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about fluid balance and ongoing abdominal pain. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and further evaluation may be needed to rule out an abscess. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, and they are orthostatic by pulse. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid administration is necessary to prevent hypotension or hypertension.
2. Infection: The presence of a urinary tract infection and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible ongoing infection. Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be continued, and the possibility of other infections should be considered.
3. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's history of gastrointestinal bleeding and hemodynamic instability suggest a potential risk for recurrent bleeding. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and stool output is important to detect any new bleeding episodes.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring is essential.
5. Fluid overload: The patient has a significant fluid deficit, and aggressive fluid resuscitation is needed. Close monitoring of fluid balance and renal"

","The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with painless bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR) and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) from 32 to 26. 

The patient has a known history of diverticulosis, which was seen on a colonoscopy performed in 2020. The presentation of painless BRBPR is most likely consistent with diverticulosis. The differential diagnosis for lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding includes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), colon cancer, and hemorrhoidal bleeding. 

The patient has received a total of 5 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for bleeding since admission. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is stable overnight, but there was an episode of bleeding this morning, with the hemoglobin concentration pending. 

The plan includes transfusing the patient with the goal of maintaining a hemoglobin concentration of 30. Two large peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are in place. The patient will undergo a flexible sigmoidoscopy (flex sig) today, followed by a possible bleeding scan with interventional radiology (IR). Fleets enema will be given to prepare for the flex sig.

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and hypertension (HTN). She presents with bright red bloody stools per rectum (BRBPR) and a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) from 32% to 26%. The patient has known diverticulosis, which is likely causing the lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She is currently hemodynamically stable.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 166/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Her heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.5 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 26%, slightly elevated potassium levels (K+) of 5.1 mEq/L, and a normal glucose level of 104 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient has been diagnosed with Klebsiella oxytoca infection in her urine culture. She is currently being treated with Ciprofloxacin.

","Summary:
The patient presents with a chief complaint of gastrointestinal bleed and anemia. The patient passed bright red blood per rectum this morning and has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleed. The patient is hemodynamically stable but on a beta blocker. A bleeding scan will be attempted to determine the source of the bleed. Consultation with surgery has also been made. Blood and stool were noted in the vagina, suggesting a possible recto-vaginal fistula. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) levels are being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hemodynamic instability: The patient may experience a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate due to the ongoing gastrointestinal bleed.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia could worsen if the gastrointestinal bleed continues or if there is inadequate replacement of blood products.
3. Infection: Due to the presence of blood and stool in the vagina, there is a risk of infection, particularly if a recto-vaginal fistula is present.
4. Organ damage: If the gastrointestinal bleed is significant and not controlled, it can lead to organ damage, including ischemia and necrosis of the bowel or other abdominal organs.
5. Fistula complications: The presence of a recto-vaginal fistula may result in further complications such as recurrent infections, incontinence, and difficulties with wound healing.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and hypertension (HTN). She presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and a drop in hemoglobin concentration from 32 to 26. She has known diverticulosis and experienced another GI bleed yesterday. The patient received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia improvement. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed, which showed diverticuli but no fresh blood or evidence of fistula. Other differentials for lower GI bleed include arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), colon cancer, and hemorrhoidal bleeding. 

The patient also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.0 today. She complained of diffuse abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant (LLQ), but showed no guarding or rebound tenderness. She was treated for an asymptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) with a three-day course of ciprofloxacin (Cipro). 

Additionally, the patient experienced vaginal bleeding, and gynecological consultation revealed no significant vaginal atrophy or indication for estrogen replacement therapy (Estring). The patient has a history of total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) with fibroids and unilateral oophorectomy. A flexible sigmoidoscopy was planned, but it would not offer much better sensitivity than the initial test. 

Regarding the patient's medical history of CAD after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), she is currently on hold from taking aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (Plavix) due to the active lower GI bleed. She will continue to be monitored for any chest pain or ischemic heart disease symptoms. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus medication, pioglitazone, is also on hold. Her blood sugar levels will be closely monitored with HISS and QIDACHS blood sugar checks. 

The patient's hypertension medications have been adjusted, with the discontinuation of many home medications due to the active GI bleed. Metoprolol 25mg and losartan 100mg are being continued. 

The patient's dementia management includes the continuation of home donepezil (Aricept) 10mg at bedtime and the temporary hold on memantine (Namenda) as non-formulary. Maintaining sleep/wake cycles and avoiding sedating medications are recommended. 

The patient's glaucoma regimen involves continuing home eye drop therapy. 

The patient's fluid and electrolyte management includes lactated Ringer boluses, regular diabetic and cardiac diets, and aggressive repletion of electrolytes as needed. 

Prophylactic measures include pneumoboots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, which the patient is refusing, and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

The patient has two central lines, a 22-gauge line placed on [**2129-8-1**] at 09:41 AM and another 22-gauge line placed on [**2129-8-4**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Re-bleeding: The patient's known diverticulosis and previous GI bleed indicate a risk of re-bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and treatment for UTI suggest a potential infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient received a significant blood transfusion, which could lead to fluid overload and subsequent hypotension.
4. Ischemic Heart Disease: Given the patient's history of CAD and recent GI bleed, there is a risk of ischemic heart disease symptoms or complications.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. Refusal of pneumoboots for DVT prevention adds to the risk.
6. Pressure Ulcers: Prolonged bed rest and immobility can increase the risk of pressure ulcers.
7. Medication Interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, some of which may interact with each other, potentially causing adverse effects or reducing their efficacy."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) in the past. She also has diabetes mellitus (DM), dementia, and hypertension (HTN). The patient presents with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, evidenced by hematochezia, bright red blood per rectum (BRBPR), and a drop in hemoglobin concentration (hct) from 32% to 26%.

The patient has known diverticulosis and previously experienced another GI bleed yesterday. She received a transfusion of one unit packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for an improvement in hct from 27% to 33.7%. A flexible sigmoidoscopy performed by the gastroenterology (GI) department was unremarkable. Other possible causes for lower GI bleed include arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), colon cancer, and hemorrhoidal bleed. However, given the presentation, diverticulosis is the most likely cause.

The patient's leukocyte count is slightly elevated at 17.5 K/uL, which may indicate leukocytosis. The cause of this increase in white blood cells is unclear, but the patient remains afebrile and complains of diffuse abdominal pain. There are no signs of an acute abdomen or any specific cause of pain on physical examination. A urinary tract infection (UTI) is"

","The patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding and hypotension. A flexible sigmoidoscopy confirmed the presence of diverticula, but no fistula was documented. The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is now hemodynamically stable. 

On the 24-hour flow sheet, the patient's vital signs are within normal range. The heart rate (HR) is 59 bpm, which is on the lower end of the normal range (45-70 bpm). Blood pressure (BP) is 146/52 mmHg, indicating hypertension. Respiratory rate (RR) is 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 100%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to Vioxx, Celebrex, and Motrin. The last dose of antibiotics was given on [**2129-8-4**] at 12:11 AM. The patient is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) through an infusion.

The patient's weight has decreased from 95 kg at admission to 65.1 kg currently. There is no edema in either lower extremity, and no cyanosis or clubbing is observed. 

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL, leukocyte count of 131 K/uL, and platelet count of 128 K/uL. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is 15 mg/d"
