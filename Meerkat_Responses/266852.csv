   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.
   - C-[**Doctor First Name 458**] evaluation for CABG, but likely will be > 7 days away.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start ACE-I and bblocker once BP and HR tolerate
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   - resume coumadin as will need bacteremia fully treated prior to
   surgery.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct. Will not exclude pulmonary
   source of infection given chills and leukocytosis and large A-a
   gradient.  Patient is hypertensive at baseline on metoprolol 150 mg PO
   BID, Losartan 100 mg DAILY, Amlodipine 10 mg, Minoxidil 10 mg PO QAM,
   and Lisinopril 40 mg DAILY at home.  Hypotensive s/p 1.9 L IVF
   removal.  Likely with diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency.
   Given bacteremia, may need generous IVF resuscitation.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - Will support blood pressure with IVF
   - Wean neosynepherin
   - Hold blood pressure lowering medications for now
   RHYTHM: NSR currently, but had 2 episodes of SVT associated with
   hypotension to SBPs of 60.  The episode started with APB, had
   prolonging PR intervals and ended with an atrial pause, with HR around
   150.  Ddx includes A-tach and AVNRT.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Patient intubated in for acute
   respiratory distress.  Has high FiO2 requirement and large A-a
   gradient.  CXR shows volume overload and possible developing
   infiltrate.
   - Abx with vanc and zosyn for HAP coverage.  Follow sputum culture
   - Fluid goal even, may need to diurese to compensate for obligate IVF.
   - daily CXR
   - Wean FiO2 as tolerated, consider increasing PEEP if pressure
   tolerates.
   BACTEREMIA: Chills during HD and low grade temp, along with elevated
   WBC and left count.  Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from
   indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   - Zosyn to meropenem if worsening for ESBL coverage.  No h/o pip-tazo
   resistance
   - will attempt to treat through bacteremia, but may need to pull line
   if GNR are pseudomonas or other difficult organisms.
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - restart coumadin with goal [**2-6**], currently subtheraputic, bridge with
   heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  NPO, HD today, TF consult
   ACCESS: Peripheral EJ IV and one peripheral IV, HD line, will likely
   need central access.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), and hypothyroidism. The patient presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia.

The patient has been intubated due to acute respiratory distress and is currently on mechanical ventilation with an FiO2 requirement of 50% and a large A-a gradient. The chest X-ray shows evidence of volume overload and possible developing infiltrate.

The patient has severe flow-limiting lesions on coronary angiography that are not amenable to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and will likely require coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient's troponin levels are elevated well above baseline, and there are new left bundle branch block (LBBB) findings with ST elevations under criteria for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in LBBB.

The patient's blood pressure is difficult to control, and there are concerns about diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency. The patient's electrolytes are being monitored, and beta-blockers will be initiated once the blood pressure allows for it.

The patient has experienced two episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), which were associated with hypotension. The differential diagnosis includes atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) and atrial tachycardia.

The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to uremia. The patient's diabetes mellitus is being managed with tight glycemic control.

The patient has a history of stroke and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) will be monitored, and heparin will be used for bridging therapy.

The patient's bacteremia is being treated with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). The source of infection could be pulmonary or related to the indwelling hemodialysis line. Daily blood cultures will be obtained to monitor the response to treatment.

The patient's end-stage renal disease requires ongoing hemodialysis treatment. The patient's fluid status will be carefully monitored, and diuresis may be required to compensate for obligate intravenous fluid administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pulmonary complications: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema increase the risk of pneumonia or worsening respiratory failure.

2. Cardiac complications: The patient's myocardial infarction, diastolic dysfunction, and potential cardiac surgery (CABG"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacilli (GNR) bacteremia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient is on 50% FiO2 and intubated due to acute respiratory distress. There is evidence of volume overload and possible developing infiltrate on the chest X-ray. This suggests the need for close monitoring and appropriate management of the patient's respiratory status.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, likely secondary to pneumonia. Chills during HD and low-grade fever, along with elevated white blood cell (WBC) and left count, indicate an ongoing infection. Possible sources include pulmonary and skin from the indwelling HD line. Antibiotics with Zosyn are being continued for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage, and daily blood cultures will be done.

3. Coronaries: The patient appears to have demand ischemia given the infection. Initially thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above baseline and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) with ST elevations under criteria for ST-elevation myocard"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line.  GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.
   - C-[**Doctor First Name 458**] evaluation for CABG, but likely will be > 7 days away.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start ACE-I and bblocker once BP and HR tolerate
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   - resume coumadin as will need bacteremia fully treated prior to
   surgery.
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present.
   Likely with diastolic dysfunction and preload dependency.  Given
   bacteremia, may need generous IVF resuscitation.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - Will support blood pressure with IVF
   - Wean neosynepherin
   - Hold blood pressure lowering medications for now
   RHYTHM: NSR currently, but had 2 episodes of SVT associated with
   hypotension to SBPs of 60.  The episode started with APB, had
   prolonging PR intervals and ended with an atrial pause, with HR around
   150.  Ddx includes A-tach and AVNRT.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR
   - continue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  NPO, HD today, TF consult
   ACCESS: Peripheral EJ IV and one peripheral IV, HD line, will likely
   need central access.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension. The patient presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia.

The patient was intubated due to acute respiratory distress and is currently on 50% FiO2. A chest X-ray shows volume overload and possible developing infiltrate. Antibiotics (Zosyn) have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage. Hemodialysis has been scheduled for today, and daily chest X-rays will be done.

The patient is likely experiencing bacteremia, which is likely secondary to pneumonia. Chills during HD and low-grade fever, along with elevated white blood cell count, indicate possible sources such as pulmonary and skin from the indwelling HD line. The HD line has been kept in place.

The patient appears to have demand ischemia given the infection. Initially thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin levels well above baseline and new left bundle branch block (LBBB) with ST elevations under criteria for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in LBBB.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Pt on 50%FiO2, patient intubated in for
   acute respiratory distress.  CXR shows volume overload and possible
   developing infiltrate.
   - Abx with zosyn for HAP coverage.
   - HD today
   - daily CXR
   BACTEREMIA:  Likely secondary to pneumonia.  Chills during HD and low
   grade temp, along with elevated WBC and left count.  Possible sources
   include pulmonary and skin from indwelling HD line. GNR in blood
   cultures, Pantoea spp, no MICs available.   HD line kept in place.
   - Cont Zosyn
   - daily blood cultures
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - Trend CKs to peak
   - continue ASA, statin
   - start bblocker
   - ck lipid panel for risk reduction with goal LDL < 70
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - eval with ECHO today
   - consider adding BB
   RHYTHM: NSR currently
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - add beta-blockade when pressure tolerates
   ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: Resolved.  Likely secondary to uremia. Lactate
   normal
   - HD today
   - monitor lytes
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - goal even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.
   - monitor PT/INR

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), presenting with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacterial bacteremia. The patient was intubated due to acute respiratory distress and is currently on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). A chest X-ray (CXR) shows volume overload and possible developing infiltrate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation require continuous monitoring and management of respiratory support. The CXR findings suggest potential developing infiltrate, indicating a possible pneumonia or worsening pulmonary edema.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has elevated white blood cell (WBC) count and left shift, along with chills during HD and low-grade fever. These symptoms suggest secondary bacteremia likely due to pneumonia or skin infection from the indwelling HD line. Pantoea spp. has been identified in blood cultures, but no minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) are available. The HD line will be kept in place, and antibiotic therapy with Zosyn will be continued. Daily blood cultures will be done.

3. Coronaries: The patient appears to have demand ischemia given the infection"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and hypertension (HTN). She presented with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacterial bacteremia.

The patient has had several medical complications and interventions during her stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). These include:

1. Atrial tachycardia: The patient experienced an episode of atrial tachycardia, which was managed with intravenous (IV) Lopressor and resolved.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, likely secondary to pneumonia. The blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods (GNR), specifically Pantoea spp., although it is unclear if Pantoea is related to the pneumonia or a contaminant. The patient is being treated with Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage.

3. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient initially required mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure but is now improving. She is being weaned off pressure support with 40% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), and the plan is to extubate her today.

CXR: Improved bibasilar atelectasis with persistent small left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA:  Pantoea spp in multiple cultures, likely a line-associated
   infection.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to pneumonia.  Renal
   recommends removing the dialysis catheter as WBC and fever curve is not
   improving.
   - Plan to have line holiday over weekend and replace line on Monday.
   - Cont Meropenem for 2 week course, will need PICC placed as well.
   - blood cultures today for surveilence.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   - Increasing hypotension with resolution of sepsis.  Will uptitrate BB
   as necessary and add back ACE.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Marked improvement in resp status
   following Abx and diuresis, now -1L for LOS.  Patient extubated without
   difficulties.
   - Continue meropenem for PNA coverage
   - Avoid excessive volume overload
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin, beta-blocker, ACE
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.  INT > 2

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. He presents with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), pulmonary edema, and bacteremia caused by Pantoea species. The patient's current condition is stable, with improvement in respiratory status following antibiotic therapy and diuresis. He is extubated without difficulties and maintains an oxygen saturation of 98% on 4L nasal cannula. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 140/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant and conversant patient with normal air entry bilaterally and mild rales. There is no neck stiffness or nuchal rigidity noted.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. Blood cultures are positive for Pantoea species, which is sensitive to meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin. The sputum culture shows sparse growth of gram-negative rods consistent with oropharyngeal flora. The chest X-ray shows improved bibasilar atelectasis with persistent small left pleural"

      SPARSE GROWTH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
      GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
         CONSISTENT WITH OROPHARYNGEAL FLORA.
CXR: Improved bibasilar atelectasis with persistent small left pleural effusion.
   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo W with PMH of DM, ESRD on HD, CVA, HTN presents with NSTEMI and
   pulmonary edema in setting of GNR bacteremia.
   BACTEREMIA:  Pantoea spp in multiple cultures, likely a line-associated
   infection.  Unclear if Pantoea is related to pneumonia.  Renal
   recommends removing the dialysis catheter as WBC and fever curve is not
   improving.
   - Plan to have line holiday over weekend and replace line on Monday.
   - Cont Meropenem for 2 week course, will need PICC placed as well.
   - daily blood cultures.  NGTD since [**11-22**]
   PUMP: Evidence of pulmonary edema on CXR, likely source of SOB and
   hypoxemia in setting of acute infarct.  Echo shows normal EF,
   interatrial aneurysm present and mild regional left ventricular
   systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior
   wall, distal septum and apex.
   HYPOXIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE:   Marked improvement in resp status
   following Abx and diuresis, now even for LOS.  Patient extubated
   without difficulties.
   - Continue meropenem for PNA coverage
   - Avoid excessive volume overload
   CORONARIES:  Appears to have demand ischemia given infection.
   Originally thought to be NSTEMI based on elevated troponin well above
   baseline and new LBBB with ST elevations under criteria for STEMI in
   LBBB.  Given cath with severe flow-limiting lesions that appear
   chronic, more likely to be demand ischemia, especially given
   bacteremia.  Lesions on cath not amenable to PCI and will likely need
   CABG.  CT surgery is following, considers patient to be viable
   candidate once medically stable.
   - continue ASA, statin
   - restart bblocker when stable.
   RHYTHM: NSR currently.  Patient had episode of Atrial tachycardia,
   broke with IV Lopressor.
   - continue monitor on TELE
   - If pt has recurrence of rhythm, will give IV BB as needed;
   cardioversion if Hemodynamically unstable.
   ESRD on HD:
   - dialysis today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue nephrocaps and calcium acetate
   DIABETES: Would aim for tight glucose control given sepsis picture.
   - Hold glipizide
   - ISS for now
   HISTORY OF STROKE:  Per family, patient has no residual deficits.  On
   coumadin at home.  INT 2.4 today.
   - discontinue heparin
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
   - continue levothyroxine
   FEN:  TF start today, HD today,

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, cerebrovascular accident, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. The patient presents with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and pulmonary edema in the setting of gram-negative bacteremia.

The assessment indicates that the patient has bacteremia caused by Pantoea species, which is likely a line-associated infection. The source of infection is unclear, but it could be related to pneumonia or the dialysis catheter. Renal recommends removing the dialysis catheter as the white blood cell (WBC) and fever curve is not improving.

The plan includes having a line holiday over the weekend and replacing the line on Monday. Continuous meropenem will be administered for a two-week course, and a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) will be placed. Daily blood cultures will be performed.

The patient also has evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, likely due to acute infarct. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction, interatrial aneurysm, and mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal hypokinesis of the distal inferior wall, distal septum, and apex.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly following antibiotic treatment and diuresis. The patient was successfully extubated without difficulties.
