   Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 7221**] is a 65 yo female with severe COPD on chronic steroids
   admitted with SOB secondary to COPD exacerbation.
   .
   Shortness of breath.  Patient had COPD exacerbation in setting of
   steroid taper (now at 30 mg/day of prednisone).  Possible LLL pneumonia
   on CXR.  She has received levaquin mult times recently for COPD flares,
   so will use azithromycin on this admission in addition to vanco/zosyn
   given frequent hospitalizations.  Patient briefly required BIPAP though
   now comfortable on home 02 requirements (3-4L NC).
   - albuterol, atrovent nebs
   - hold tiotropium
   - supplemental oxygen with goal O2 sat of 90-92%, BIPAP as needed
   - solumedrol 125 IV q 8 hours
   - azithromycin
   - begin bactrim prophylaxis for chronic steroid use and frequent
   exacerbations requiring high doses of steroids
   .
   Leukocytosis.  Patient has leukcytosis though likely secondary to PNA
   and chronic steroid use.  Has chronic cough with no fevers (though on
   steroids).  LLL infitrate on CXR.
   - follow WBC
   - monitor fever curve
   - azithromycin, vanco/zosyn for PNA
   - f/u blood, urine, sputum cultures
   .
   Osteoporosis.  History of vertebral fractures.
   - calcium/vit D
   .
   Tachycardia.  Patient has longstanding tachycardia.  Was euthyroid on
   last admission, had negative CTA on [**2196-9-23**].  No evidence of
   dehydration.  [**Month (only) 60**] be related to pain (has left rib pain/muscle strain)
   and/or frequent albuterol nebs.
   - monitor on tele
   - oxycodone prn for pain

","Summary of Progress Note:
Ms. [Name13 (STitle) 7221] is a 65-year-old female with severe COPD on chronic steroids admitted with shortness of breath secondary to COPD exacerbation. The patient required albuterol and atrovent nebs, supplemental oxygen, BIPAP, solumedrol, azithromycin, and bactrim prophylaxis. She has leukocytosis likely due to pneumonia and chronic steroid use. The patient also has a history of osteoporosis, tachycardia, and left rib pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's leukocytosis and infil-trate on CXR suggest a possible lower lobe pneumonia. The prescribed azithromycin and vancomycin/zosyn are appropriate treatments.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and risk factors such as COPD and steroid use, there is a potential risk for developing DVT. Prophylactic measures should be taken.
3. Stress Ulcers: The patient's chronic steroid use and critical condition increase the risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic treatment with H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors should be considered.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular monitoring and appropriate antibiotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with severe COPD on chronic steroids admitted with shortness of breath secondary to a COPD exacerbation. She also has left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has been experiencing respiratory decompensation after movement, which responded to albuterol/ipratropium nebs and ativan. She received oxycodone for rib pain. The patient had another episode of desaturation during transfer to MICU-6 but responded well to another albuterol/ipratropium neb. She was switched to Xopinex with some improvement in symptoms and less tachycardia. The patient reports feeling better with Xopinex treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea: The patient's primary concern is dyspnea, most likely due to a COPD exacerbation in the setting of steroid taper and LLL pneumonia on CXR.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, likely secondary to pneumonia and chronic steroid use.
3. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of vertebral fractures, indicating osteoporosis.
4. Tachycardia: The patient has longstanding tachycardia, worsened by beta agonist therapy but improved with Xopinex.
5. Left rib pain: The patient is experiencing left rib pain, with preliminary rib films not showing evidence of fracture."

","The patient is a 56-year-old male with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema presenting with respiratory distress. The patient experienced acute respiratory distress last night during bathing, with oxygen saturation levels in the low 80s, requiring continuous nebulization and some pain control. He was then transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) for further management.

The patient has a history of allergies to codeine, aspirin, and erythromycin. He is currently receiving multiple medications, including lorazepam, pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other ICU medications. 

On review of systems, the patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 120 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 91/54 mmHg to 142/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's temperature is currently 35.7 degrees Celsius and maximum temperature recorded overnight was 37.3 degrees Celsius. The patient is on non-invasive ventilation and receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and face tent.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.5 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL, platelet count of 437 K/uL, blood glucose level of 206 mg/dL, creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, and slightly elevated levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride. Other lab values such as liver enzymes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal limits.

The patient's condition is complicated by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, possibly due to left lower lobe pneumonia. He is being treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, nebulizations, and antibiotics to cover both community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia. Bipap support is provided as needed. The patient's tachycardia may be related to long-standing issues and excess albuterol use, and he will be monitored on telemetry. Repeat echocardiogram and thyroid function tests are planned.

Rib pain is attributed to significant coughing and possible mild pleurisy or rib fracture, with further evaluation through rib films. A repeat chest X-ray is scheduled in the morning. The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the MICU.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and additional details may be available in the patient's medical records."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory distress. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis, and emphysema, and is currently experiencing an acute exacerbation. The patient requires non-invasive ventilation and is being treated with IV Medrol, nebs, and antibiotics (Vanco, Zosyn, azithro) to cover for nosocomial pneumonia. Bipap is provided as needed. The patient also has a long-standing issue of tachycardia with some cardiomyopathy and excess albuterol use, and will be monitored on telemetry. An echo and TFTs will be repeated to evaluate the cardiac condition. The patient is also experiencing rib pain, possibly due to coughing or mild pleurisy versus rib fracture, and rib films will be checked. The patient's other issues will be addressed according to the housestaff notes. In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and has multiple lines inserted. Prophylaxis is being given for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is pending further evaluation and treatment."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with severe COPD on chronic steroids admitted with shortness of breath secondary to a COPD exacerbation. She also has left lower lobe pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen with a goal O2 saturation of 90-92%, and BIPAP as needed. She is receiving IV solumedrol, atrovent nebs, and xopinex as needed. Bactrim prophylaxis is being given for chronic steroid use and frequent exacerbations requiring high doses of steroids. The patient has a history of leukocytosis, osteoporosis, tachycardia, and left rib pain. She is being monitored closely, and her condition will be followed up with blood, urine, and sputum cultures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings indicate the presence of pneumonia. This condition can worsen and lead to further respiratory distress.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's severe COPD and current respiratory status, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can result in significant respiratory compromise.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. This can prolong her ICU stay and increase the risk of mortality.
4. Deep Vein Th"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with severe COPD, admitted with shortness of breath secondary to a COPD exacerbation and left lower lobe pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU for management. The patient has a history of chronic steroid use, osteoporosis, and previous vertebral fractures. She presents with leukocytosis, tachycardia, and left rib pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has left lower lobe pneumonia as per the chest X-ray. This will need to be monitored and treated appropriately with antibiotics.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's symptoms are consistent with a COPD exacerbation, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
3. Osteoporosis: The patient has a history of osteoporosis and previous vertebral fractures. This increases her risk of future fractures and complications related to bone health.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an infection or inflammatory response. It is important to monitor this and ensure it resolves with appropriate treatment.
5. Tachycardia: The patient has a longstanding tachycardia, which may be related to her chronic steroid use or COPD. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential.
6. Left Rib Pain: The patient is experiencing left rib pain, but preliminary rib films do not show evidence of fracture. Pain management will be"
