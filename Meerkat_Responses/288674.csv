   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on 150mg prednisone/day, cellcept and rituxan.  Was admitted
   earlier this month with a perforated sigmoid diverticulum and managed
   conservatively, now back with CT findings concerning for early abscess.
   # Abdominal abscess: 8 cm fluid/air collection. Cellcept d/c
d, Zosyn
   started. IR attempted to drain yesterday without success.
   -          Plan is to intubate patient this AM, then 2^nd IR team will
   attempt to drain
   -          If
   He was readmitted on [**1-30**] with weakness and SOB and worsening
   hemoptysis.  Cell cept was discontinued and CT abdomen/pelvis done
   showing a growing collection of fluid/air (8cm) concerning for early
   abscess.  Surgery and ID were consulted and Zosyn was started.  Plan
   was for IR to drain collection yesterday but they were unable to find
   drainable fluid.  An second IR team evaluated the patient and will
   attempt again to drain the fluid tomorrow.
   If that is unsuccessful, patient will have to go to surgery.  In order
   for this to occur, plan is for elective intubation tomorrow morning
   following by IR drainage and subsequent surgery if necessary.  Given
   that patient is on high dose steroids, pheresis and IvIg may be given
   prior to surgery is patient remains hemodynamically stable.  In the
   case that he is unstable, IvIg can be given without plasmpheresis.  His
   pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his rheumatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] are
   following him closely.
   On transfer to the floor, patient reports that he is pain free and
   slightly anxious.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and other medical conditions such as interstitial lung disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, DVT with pulmonary embolization, and more. He is currently admitted to the ICU with an enlarging sigmoid abscess and perforated sigmoid diverticulum. The patient is hemodynamically stable on linezolid and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics. The plan is to intubate the patient, attempt second IR drainage of the abscess, and possibly proceed with sigmoid resection if necessary. The patient also has multi-organism bacteremia, and his blood cultures are pending. He requires close monitoring for signs of sepsis and careful blood pressure and urine output monitoring. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has an enlarging sigmoid abscess and is at risk for developing sepsis if the infection spreads.
2. Respiratory failure: Due to the patient's underlying pulmonary conditions and the need for intubation, there is a risk of respiratory failure.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, which increases the risk of bleeding during surgical procedures.
4. Organism resistance: With multi-organism bacteremia, there is a potential for antibiotic resistance, making it challenging to treat the infection effectively.
5. Surgical complications"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on 150mg prednisone/day, cellcept and rituxan.  Was admitted
   earlier this month with a perforated sigmoid diverticulum and managed
   conservatively as surgery was not felt to be a good option for him
   given his high dose immunusuppression and risk of poor healing.  He
   received zosyn and was changed to po augmentin prior to discharge.
   He was readmitted on [**1-30**] with weakness and SOB and worsening
   hemoptysis.  Cell cept was discontinued and CT abdomen/pelvis done
   showing a growing collection of fluid/air (8cm) concerning for early
   abscess.  Surgery and ID were consulted and Zosyn was started.  Plan
   was for IR to drain collection yesterday but they were unable to find
   drainable fluid.  An second IR team evaluated the patient and will
   attempt again to drain the fluid tomorrow.
   If that is unsuccessful, patient will have to go to surgery.  In order
   for this to occur, plan is for elective intubation tomorrow morning
   following by IR drainage and subsequent surgery if necessary.  Given
   that patient is on high dose steroids, pheresis and IvIg may be given
   prior to surgery is patient remains hemodynamically stable.  In the
   case that he is unstable, IvIg can be given without plasmpheresis.  His
   pulmonologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and his rheumatologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] are
   following him closely.
   On transfer to the floor, patient reports that he is pain free and
   slightly anxious.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and other medical conditions. He is currently admitted to the ICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at interventional radiology (IR) drainage and possible sigmoid resection due to an enlarging sigmoid abscess. The patient has multi-organism bacteremia and a history of previous episodes of diverticulitis. He is on high-dose immunosuppression and has a complicated medical history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has multi-organism bacteremia, which increases the risk of developing sepsis, especially if the infection spreads to other parts of the body.
2. Abscess rupture: The enlarging sigmoid abscess could rupture and lead to peritonitis or dissemination of infection.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's planned intubation and surgery pose a risk of respiratory failure, particularly if there are complications during the procedure.
4. Bleeding: The patient's use of anticoagulants and immunosuppression may increase the risk of bleeding during surgery.
5. Anesthesia-related complications: Intubation and surgery carry inherent risks associated with anesthesia, including allergic reactions, cardiovascular or respiratory events.
6. Organism resistance: The presence of multi-organism bacteremia raises concerns about developing antibiotic resistance, making treatment more challenging.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on daily prednisone, cellcept, and rituxan. The patient presented with CT findings concerning for an early sigmoid abscess following conservative management of sigmoid diverticulitis. The patient was admitted to the MICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at IR drainage and possible sigmoid resection. 

The patient has a previous episode of diverticulitis with a feculent collection adjacent to the loop of sigmoid colon. There is also extensive colonic diverticulosis, a paraumbilical hernia containing nonobstructed, nondilated loops of small bowel, stable scarring at bilateral lung bases with fibrotic changes, and stable hypodensity in the pancreas which could represent an IMPN or pancreatic cyst.

The patient is currently being managed for multiple complications including a sigmoid abscess, multi-organism bacteremia, pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, Foley placement, type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and spinal stenosis.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.8°C (96.4°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/73 to 153/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is intubated and has a central venous line placed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid abscess: The patient has a large fluid/air collection in the sigmoid region, indicating an abscess. If the second attempt at interventional radiology (IR) drainage fails, the patient may require surgery for resection.
2. Multi-organism bacteremia: The patient has GNR and GPC organisms on blood cultures, indicating a systemic infection. Antibiotic therapy should be continued, and daily blood cultures should be monitored for signs of sepsis.
3. Pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis: The patient's underlying condition involves inflammation of the blood vessels in the lungs. Steroid therapy will be discontinued due to the presence of an abscess, and hydrocortisone will be started to manage inflammation.
4. Foley placement: The patient requires a urinary catheter placement, but there was a traumatic attempt. Urology consultation is needed for proper placement.
5. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient's diabetes management should continue with Lantus and SSI.
6. Restless leg syndrome: Ropinerole should be continued for symptom control.
7. Anxiety: SSRI should be discontinued while on linezolid.
8. DVT with pulmonary embolization: The patient has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, admitted to the MICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at IR drainage and possible sigmoid resection. The patient has a CT finding concerning for an early sigmoid abscess and has been started on Zosyn. The first attempt at IR drainage yesterday was unsuccessful, and the patient is currently intubated with a CVL placed. The plan is for the second IR team to attempt to drain the abscess, followed by the placement of a plasmapheresis catheter if necessary. If the attempt to drain fails, the patient will go to surgery. The patient is also being treated for multi-organism bacteremia, pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and spinal stenosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 136/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 2.7 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 8.4 g/dL, elevated glucose level of 193 mg/dL, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is currently receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a CT finding concerning for an early sigmoid abscess. If not properly managed, this could lead to worsening infection and sepsis.
2. Multi-Organism Bacteremia: The patient has an infection with multiple organisms in the blood. If not effectively treated, this could result in sepsis and further complications.
3. Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis: The patient has a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, which can cause lung damage and potentially lead to respiratory failure.
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state.
5. Restless Leg Syndrome: This condition can cause discomfort and sleep disturbances for the patient.
6. Anxiety: Untreated anxiety can lead to increased stress and potential complications related to the patient's overall well-being.
7. DVT with Pulmonary Embolization: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, which can cause further clot formation and potentially lead to respiratory and circulatory problems.
8. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: This condition"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on immunosuppression.
- He underwent intubation and an interventional radiology (IR) guided drain placement of a sigmoid abscess that was refractory to conservative management.
- The patient has been experiencing brown liquid drainage from the drain, which is suspected to be polymicrobial.
- He has been started on piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and linezolid, but linezolid was pulled back based on known culture data.
- The patient is receiving intravenous fluids (IVF) and a 5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
- There are concerns about the patient's abdominal exam, as well as ongoing cultures for the drainage and other organisms.
- The patient also has multi-organism bacteremia with cultures growing Morganella and streptococcus viridans, which were not previously identified in the hospital system.
- He is being monitored closely for sepsis and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) has been ordered to rule out endocarditis, given the streptococcus viridans bacteremia.
- The patient underwent elective intubation for an IR procedure and had significant atelectasis on chest X-ray, likely due to inadequate PEEP in a morbidly"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of abdominal abscess/diverticulitis with bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a central venous line (CVL) placed, as well as an intra-abdominal drain for the abscess. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 90/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including antibiotics (Linezolid and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), IVIg, hydrocortisone, and others for various conditions such as respiratory failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These may include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation with CPAP/PPS mode, indicating respiratory distress or failure. The ABG results show a slightly elevated pH and low PCO2, suggesting respiratory alkalosis. There is also an increased plateau pressure of 20 cmH2O, which may indicate the need for increased PEEP to improve oxygenation and prevent ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Infection: The"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill obese individual with multiple medical complications. They have been admitted to the ICU and are currently intubated with invasive ventilation support. The patient has a central venous line (CVL) placed, as well as an intra-abdominal drain due to a polymicrobial fluid infection. They have been given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and hydrocortisone for suspected pulmonary vasculitis or alveolar hemorrhage. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but there are concerns about fluid balance, respiratory support, and potential complications such as abdominal abscess/diverticulitis with bacteremia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on invasive ventilation support, indicating respiratory failure. The plan is to increase PEEP and follow up with a chest X-ray to monitor progress. If extubation is possible today, it would be beneficial.
2. Abdominal abscess/diverticulitis with bacteremia: The patient has an intra-abdominal drain in place and is receiving antibiotics (zosyn) after obtaining blood cultures. Monitoring for signs of infection or worsening condition is crucial.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of difficulty breathing. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment of suspected sepsis and diverticulitis. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and multi-lumen catheter placement. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 90/46 to 140/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 36.1 C (96.9 F). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged from admission except for the recent events mentioned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, should be done. Early identification and appropriate antibiotic treatment are crucial in preventing or managing this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization and invasive procedures can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the deep veins. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses and performing lower extremity venous ultrasonography can help detect DVT early. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings and early ambulation should be implemented to reduce the risk.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The presence of multi-lumen catheters increases the risk of bloodstream infections. Daily assessment of the catheter site for signs of infection, such as erythema, warmth, and purulence, is important. Cultures and laboratory tests should be done if there is suspicion of infection.
4. Nosocomial delirium: Prolonged ICU stay, use of sedatives, and invasive procedures can contribute to delirium. Frequent cognitive assessments and implementation of non-pharmacological interventions, such as reorientation and providing familiar objects, can help prevent or manage this complication.
5. Pressure ulcers: Immobility and increased pressure from the endotracheal tube can lead to pressure ulcers. Regular skin assessments and implementation of appropriate pressure relief measures, such as repositioning and using pressure-relieving mattresses, are necessary to prevent this complication.
6. Medication errors: The patient is on multiple medications, which increases the risk of medication errors. Strict adherence to medication protocols, proper documentation, and double-checking medication orders are essential to prevent medication errors.

Overall, the patient's current condition appears stable with appropriate management in place. However, these potential medical complications should be closely monitored and addressed to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is an obese individual who has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of abdominal abscess/diverticulitis/abscess and bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. They have a central venous line (CVL) placed, as well as an intra-abdominal drain. The patient is being treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and prednisone for their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing pneumonia. This can be prevented by proper hand hygiene, early mobilization, and daily lung examination.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous lines increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such as compression stockings or low molecular weight heparin should be implemented.
3. Stress ulcers: The ICU stay, along with the use of corticosteroids, increases the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors should be administered to prevent this complication.
4. Alveolar hemorrhage: The patient's condition involves pulmonary vasculitis, which puts them at risk for alveolar hemorrhage. Close monitoring of respiratory status and prompt identification of any signs of bleeding are crucial.
5. Infection at the Foley catheter site: The traumatic placement of the Foley catheter increases"

They have received antibiotics, including Linezolid and Piperacillin/Tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate between 68-87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 to 130/99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an appropriate fluid balance. 

The patient's respiratory support includes a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery, standby ventilator mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.50, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 150. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be alert and oriented, with clear breath sounds and symmetric chest expansion. There is no evidence of distension or tenderness in the abdomen. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient attentive and following commands, but no further assessment was performed.

   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on immunosuppression, now s/p intubation and IR guided drain
   placement of sigmoid abscess refractory to conservative management.
   # Sigmoid abscess: Draining brown liquid drainage, with polymicrobial
   gram stain. Zosyn and linezolid started but linezolid pulled back to
   target known culture data.  * Decreased drain output in the last 23
   hours, Gen [**Doctor First Name **] aware
   - Monitor drainage output
   - C/w zosyn
   - F/u drainage and other outstanding cultures
   - Appreciate IR, ID recs
   - Continue with intravenous fluids at least until TPN initiated
   - C/w 5 day course IVIG (Day [**3-4**] today)
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  Culture growing morganella and strep
   viridans, neither of which identified on prior culture data in [**Hospital1 5**]
   system. HD stable.
   - Continue Zosyn as above
   - Monitor closely for sepsis
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis, given strep viridans bacteremia, ordered
   still needs to be done
   # Elective intubation for IR procedure: Weaned to PS 5, PEEP 5
   yesterday; sedation turned off and patient extubated without incidence
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  On high amounts of
   hydrocortisone, with goal to wean down to 80 mg TID by time of
   potential surgical intervention. Off Cellcept and Rixtuxan.
   - Aggressive steroid taper over next 1-2 weeks
 currently
   Hydrocortisone 200
 180mg TID. Will wean to 160mg TID today
   - C/w IVIG as above
   - C/w Bactrim ppx
   # Anemia: In setting of surgical intervention on abdominal abscess and
   traumatic foley placement. No pulmonary hemorrhage noted on suctioning,
   extubation etc. * Received one unit pRBC yesterday and bumped
   appropriately
   - Monitor for pulmonary hemorrhage
 if Hct continues to drop, consider
   bronchoscopy given history of recurrent hemoptysis
   - Monitor for worsening hematuria given traumatic foley placement
   - Recheck Hct this afternoon to assess for stability
   # Traumatic Foley placement: Per urology, keep foley in for one week
   (from [**2-5**] when placed), c/w antibiotics.
   - Urine culture for any fevers
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Continue Lantus and SSI
   # Restless Legs Syndrome: Continue ropinerole
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT with pulmonary embolization - s/p IVC filter placement
   # BPH: Continue tamsulosin
   # GERD: Home PPI
   # HTN: Home Sotolol
 will need to replete K vigilantly on Sotolol
   # Spinal stenosis: Pain control with Tylenol
   # Access: PIV x 2, IJ CVL; will request double lumen PICC
   # FEN: Replete lytes PRN; nutrition consult for TPN
   # Code: Full
   # Dispo: ICU for now
 if Hct stable today, may transfer to floor

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on immunosuppression, now s/p intubation and IR guided drain
   placement of sigmoid abscess refractory to conservative management.
   # Sigmoid abscess: Draining brown liquid drainage, with polymicrobial
   gram stain. Zosyn and linezolid started but linezolid pulled back to
   target known culture data.
   * Decreased drain output in the last 23 hours, Gen [**Doctor First Name **] aware
   - Monitor drainage output
   - C/w zosyn
   - F/u drainage and other outstanding cultures
   - Appreciate IR, ID recs
   - Continue with intravenous fluids at least until TPN initiated
   - C/w 5 day course IVIG (Day [**3-4**] today)
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  Culture growing morganella and strep
   viridans, neither of which identified on prior culture data in [**Hospital1 5**]
   system. HD stable.
   - continue abx as above
   - monitor closely for sepsis
   - f/u speciation of organisms
   - TTE to r/o endocarditis, given strep viridans bacteremia ordered
   still needs to be done
   # Elective intubation for IR procedure: Weaned to PS 5, PEEP 5
   yesterday; sedation turned off and patient extubated without incidence
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  On high amounts of
   hydrocortisone, with goal to wean down to 80 mg TID by time of surgical
   intervention. Off Cellcept and Rixtuxan.
   - Aggressive steroid taper over next 1-2 weeks
 currently
   Hydrocortisone 200
 180mg TID
   - C/w IVIG as above
   - C/w Bactrim ppx
   # Anemia: In setting of surgical intervention on abdominal abscess and
   traumatic foley placement. No pulmonary hemorrhage noted on suctioning,
   extubation etc.
   * Received one unit pRBC yesterday and bumped appropriately
   - Monitor for pulmonary hemorrhage
 if Hct continues to drop, consider
   bronchoscopy given history of recurrent hemoptysis
   - Monitor for worsening hematuria given traumatic foley placement
   # Traumatic Foley placement: Per urology, keep foley in for one week
   (from [**2-5**] when placed), c/w antibiotics.
   - Urine culture for any fevers
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Continue Lantus and SSI
   # Restless Legs Syndrome: Continue ropinerole
   # Anxiety: SSRI
   # DVT with pulmonary embolization - s/p IVC filter placement
   # BPH: Continue tamsulosin
   # GERD: Home PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for abdominal abscess, diverticulitis, bacteremia, pulmonary vasculitis, alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and acute kidney injury. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation, transfused blood products, and various medications including antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's condition of pulmonary vasculitis and alveolar hemorrhage puts him at risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The presence of abdominal abscess and bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis or septic shock if not effectively managed.
3. Bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis and low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) increase the risk of bleeding complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage.
4. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation may progress to other cardiac complications like heart failure or stroke if not adequately managed.
5. Renal Complications: The patient's acute kidney injury may worsen if there is inadequate perfusion or ongoing nephrotoxicity from medications or other factors.
6. Nutritional Deficiencies: The patient's inability to take oral intake"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an ICU admit with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. They have a history of abdominal abscess, polymicrobial infection, diverticulitis, bacteremia, pulmonary vasculitis, alveolar hemorrhage, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation and has a drain in place for the abdominal abscess. They are on antibiotics (zosyn), NPO (nothing by mouth), and being weaned off IVIg and hydrocortisone. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have a low white blood cell count and anemia. They are being closely monitored for any changes in their condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of polymicrobial infection, abdominal abscess, and bacteremia. There is a risk of further infections due to the invasive procedures and immunosuppressive medications.
2. Bleeding: The patient's hemoptysis is stable at the moment, but there is a risk of bleeding due to the alveolar hemorrhage and the use of anticoagulant medications.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient is receiving invasive ventilation, which indicates a risk of respiratory failure if there are complications or insufficient improvement.
4. Anemia: The patient has been transfused and has a low hematocrit level, indicating a risk of"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression with enlarging sigmoid
   abscess [**2-2**] perforated sigmoid diverticulum.  Admitted to the MICU for
   elective intubation prior to second attempt at IR drainage and possible
   sigmoid resection.
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  GNR and GPC on blood cx from [**2-2**].  Cx
   from [**2-3**] and [**2-4**] pending.  Has been HD stable on linezolid and zosyn.
   - continue abx
   - daily blood cx
   - abscess management as below
   - careful bp, UOP monitoring for signs of SIRS/sepsis
   - f/u speciation of organisms
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Seen on CT on [**2-2**], 8cm area with air and feculent
   material. IR attempted drainage unsuccessfully yesterday. Plan as above
   for repeat IR drainage with possible surgery (may need even if some
   material is drained).
   - continue iv abzx - zosyn and linezolid
   - IVF
   - NPO p MN
   - have FYI'ed anesthesia regarding intubation tomorrow morning - will
   plan on intubating after 7am.  Per anesthesia attending, unusual for
   them to intubate someone and then not be present in procedure.  Will
   need to clarify in am.
   - has 2 PIV's - had planned for CVL but patient unable to lay flat for
   more than 5 minutes.  Have confirmed with anesthesia that 2 PIV's
   adequate for intubation.
   - plan for CVL and plasmapheresis catheter (see below) placement
   tomorrow after intubation and before IR procedure in case of need for
   emergent surgery.
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  Currently on prednisone 50mg tid
   which will continue.  Continue Bactrim ppx. Holding Cellcept and
   Rixtuxan given abscess.
   Plan is as follows per multi-specialty input:
   - if needs surgery and hemodynamically stable will need plasmapheresis
   and IvIG prior to surgery
   - if needs surgery and HD unstable, can get IvIG without pheresis
   - will confirm above plan with Drs [**Last Name (STitle) 104**], [**Name5 (PTitle) **] and [**Name5 (PTitle) **]
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Continue Lantus and SSI
   # RLS: Continue ropinerole
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT with pulmonary embolization - s/p IVC filter placement

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and an enlarging sigmoid abscess. He was admitted to the MICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at interventional radiology (IR) drainage and possible sigmoid resection.

The patient has multi-organism bacteremia with Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci on blood cultures from [**2-2**]. He has been stable on linezolid and Zosyn. He also has a sigmoid abscess seen on CT on [**2-2**], measuring 8cm with air and feculent material. An attempt at IR drainage was made yesterday but was unsuccessful. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate 64 bpm, blood pressure 120/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 99% on supplemental oxygen. His lab results show a white blood cell count of 36 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 32 K/uL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose of 262 mg/dL. 

The patient's medications include linezolid, Zosyn, prednisone, Bactrim prophylaxis, Lantus, SSI for type 2 diabetes mellitus, ropinerole for restless leg syndrome, SSRI for anxiety, tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia, proton pump inhibitor for GERD, sotolol for hypertension, and tylenol for spinal stenosis pain control.

   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression with enlarging sigmoid
   abscess [**2-2**] perforated sigmoid diverticulum.  Admitted to the MICU for
   elective intubation prior to second attempt at IR drainage and possible
   sigmoid resection; IR drainage was successful and drain placed
   patient extubated and transferred to the floor but developed increasing
   O2 requirement and more blood on suctioning. Was transferred back to
   MICU and intubated.

   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  GNR and GPC on blood cx from [**2-2**].  BCx
   from [**2-3**] and [**2-4**] pending.  Has been HD stable on linezolid and zosyn.
   Switched to Zosyn and added Cipro for double pseudomonas coverage.
   Sensitivity and speciation of abscess cultures showed resistance to
   Cipro, however, so patient only on Zosyn for now.
   - Continue Zosyn
   - Appreciate ID following
   - Daily blood cultures
   - Abscess management per below
   - Careful blood pressure, urine output, temperature monitoring for
   signs of SIRS/sepsis

   material. IR attempted drainage unsuccessfully initially but second
   drainage successful and drain placed
   - Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs
   - NPO and TPN for now
   - Given possibility of surgery, patient is currently off Cellcept and
   Rituxan. Also had attempted decreasing steroids but unable to given
   increased hemoptysis
   - Patient will get plasmapheresis catheter with IR today and start
   plasmapheresis today; ionized calcium and LFTs ordered
   - Completed five day course of IVIG yesterday
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  Currently on Hydrocortisone 500mg
   tid per rheumatology, given increased hemoptysis on attempted taper of
   steroids to 80mg TID.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology following: ?ability to decrease
   hydrocortisone after plasmapheresis
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Continue holding Cellcept and Rituxan given abscess; plasmapheresis
   per above
   - CBC every 8 hours to evaluate hematocrit
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   # Thrombocytopenia: Worse than prior baseline. Etiology not clear.
   - Heme/Onc consult today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on high-dose immunosuppression. The patient has an enlarging sigmoid abscess and was admitted to the MICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at IR drainage and possible sigmoid resection. The IR drainage was successful, but the patient developed increasing O2 requirement and more blood on suctioning. He was transferred back to the MICU and intubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a significant concern as indicated by the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. This may be attributed to the underlying pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage.

2. Bacteremia: The patient has multi-organism bacteremia, including GNR and GPC. This increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is being administered, but close monitoring for signs of SIRS/sepsis is necessary.

3. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has an enlarging sigmoid abscess, which may lead to further complications if not managed appropriately. Drainage of the abscess has been attempted but with initial unsuccessful results. Continuous monitoring and appropriate abscess management are essential.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression with enlarging sigmoid
   abscess [**2-2**] perforated sigmoid diverticulum.  Admitted to the MICU for
   elective intubation prior to second attempt at IR drainage and possible
   sigmoid resection; IR drainage was successful and drain placed
   patient extubated and transferred to the floor but developed increasing
   O2 requirement and more blood on suctioning. Was transferred back to
   MICU and intubated.
   .
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Seen on CT on [**2-2**], 8cm area with air and feculent
   material. IR attempted drainage unsuccessfully initially but second
   drainage successful and drain placed. Abscess cultures growing
   pseudomonas and bacteroides
   - Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs
   - CT abdomen and pelvis to evaluate progression of sigmoid abscess
   - NPO and TPN for now
   - Given possibility of surgery, patient is currently off Cellcept and
   Rituxan. Also had attempted decreasing steroids but unable to given
   increased hemoptysis
   - Patient got plasmapheresis catheter with IR yesterday and started
   plasmapheresis with plans for continued plasmapheresis for 5 sessions
   (today is Day [**2-5**]); ionized calcium and LFTs ordered
   - Completed five day course of IVIG Monday
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  Currently on Hydrocortisone 500mg
   tid per rheumatology, given increased hemoptysis on attempted taper of
   steroids to 80mg TID.
   - Rheumatology okay
d decreasing dose today but in the setting of a
   worsened CXR in the left lung fields, will continue 500mg TID for now.
   Will re-evaluate after planned bronchoscopy today to evaluate infection
   vs. further bleed
   - Will also re-order sputum and blood cultures
   - Continues to be intubated for significant hemoptysis and hypoxemia.
   Spontaneous awakening trial today. Unable to wean FiO2 etc. yesterday
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Continue holding Cellcept and Rituxan given abscess; plasmapheresis
   per above
   - CBC every 8 hours to evaluate hematocrit
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   .
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  GNR and GPC on blood cx from [**2-2**] grew out
   Morganella and Strep viridans.  BCx since are pending, NGTD.  Has been
   HD stable on linezolid and zosyn. Switched to Zosyn and added Cipro for
   double pseudomonas coverage. Sensitivity and speciation of abscess
   cultures showed resistance to Cipro, however, so patient only on Zosyn
   for now.
   - Continue Zosyn
   - Appreciate ID following
   - Follow-up strep viridans sensitivity if any
   - Daily blood cultures and one sputum culture today in setting of
   worsened CXR
   - Abscess management per below
   - Careful blood pressure, urine output, temperature monitoring for
   signs of SIRS/sepsis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after two units of platelets yesterday.
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc consult. Patient responded well to 2 units of
   platelets, other serologies pending. Not DIC per Heme/Onc on peripheral
   [**Last Name (un) 11453**] review

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient was admitted to the MICU for elective intubation prior to a second attempt at IR drainage and possible sigmoid resection. The patient had a sigmoid abscess seen on CT, which was initially unsuccessfully drained but later successfully drained and a drain was placed. Abscess cultures are growing pseudomonas and bacteroides.

The patient has been on high-dose immunosuppression with enlarging sigmoid abscess, pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and multi-organism bacteremia. The patient is currently intubated for significant hemoptysis and hypoxemia. The patient has also been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and spinal stenosis.

The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing Zosyn for abscess management, appreciating ID recs, continuing plasmapheresis for 5 sessions, monitoring secretions closely for blood loss, following up with rheumatology, and evaluating the possibility of surgery.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of pulmonary vasculitis leading to further pulmonary hemorrhage, progression of sigmoid abscess requiring surgical intervention, development of sepsis due to multi-organism bacteremia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, sigmoid abscess, and multi-organism bacteremia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for elective intubation prior to second attempt at IR drainage and possible sigmoid resection. 

The patient initially developed increasing O2 requirement and more blood on suctioning, leading to the decision to transfer him back to the ICU and intubate him again. The patient has been stable on linezolid and Zosyn, but sensitivity and speciation of abscess cultures showed resistance to Cipro, so the patient is now only on Zosyn.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and spinal stenosis.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
- Multi-organism bacteremia: Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs.
- Sigmoid abscess: Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs. NPO and TPN for now.
- Pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis: Currently on hydrocortisone 500mg tid per rheumatology, given increased hemoptysis on attempted taper of steroids to 80mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression with enlarging sigmoid
   abscess [**2-2**] perforated sigmoid diverticulum.  Admitted to the MICU for
   elective intubation prior to second attempt at IR drainage and possible
   sigmoid resection; IR drainage was successful and drain placed
   patient extubated and transferred to the floor but developed increasing
   O2 requirement and more blood on suctioning. Was transferred back to
   MICU and intubated.
   .
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Seen on CT on [**2-2**], 8cm area with air and feculent
   material. IR attempted drainage unsuccessfully initially but second
   drainage successful and drain placed. Abscess cultures growing
   pseudomonas and bacteroides
   - Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs
   - CT abdomen and pelvis to evaluate progression of sigmoid abscess
   - NPO and TPN for now
   - Given possibility of surgery, patient is currently off Cellcept and
   Rituxan. Also had attempted decreasing steroids but unable to given
   increased hemoptysis
   - Patient got plasmapheresis catheter with IR yesterday and started
   plasmapheresis with plans for continued plasmapheresis for 5 sessions
   (today is Day [**2-5**]); ionized calcium and LFTs ordered
   - Completed five day course of IVIG Monday
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  Currently on Hydrocortisone 500mg
   tid per rheumatology, given increased hemoptysis on attempted taper of
   steroids to 80mg TID.
   - Rheumatology okay
d decreasing dose today but in the setting of a
   worsened CXR in the left lung fields, will continue 500mg TID for now.
   Will re-evaluate after planned bronchoscopy today to evaluate infection
   vs. further bleed
   - Will also re-order sputum and blood cultures
   - Continues to be intubated for significant hemoptysis and hypoxemia.
   Spontaneous awakening trial today. Unable to wean FiO2 etc. yesterday
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Continue holding Cellcept and Rituxan given abscess; plasmapheresis
   per above
   - CBC every 8 hours to evaluate hematocrit
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   .
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  GNR and GPC on blood cx from [**2-2**] grew out
   Morganella and Strep viridans.  BCx since are pending, NGTD.  Has been
   HD stable on linezolid and zosyn. Switched to Zosyn and added Cipro for
   double pseudomonas coverage. Sensitivity and speciation of abscess
   cultures showed resistance to Cipro, however, so patient only on Zosyn
   for now.
   - Continue Zosyn
   - Appreciate ID following
   - Follow-up strep viridans sensitivity if any
   - Daily blood cultures and one sputum culture today in setting of
   worsened CXR
   - Abscess management per below
   - Careful blood pressure, urine output, temperature monitoring for
   signs of SIRS/sepsis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after two units of platelets yesterday.
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc consult. Patient responded well to 2 units of
   platelets, other serologies pending. Not DIC per Heme/Onc on peripheral
   [**Last Name (un) 11453**] review
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: Continue Lantus and SSI
   - Appreciate [**Last Name (un) 72**] following
   # RLS: Continue ropinerole
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT with pulmonary embolization - s/p IVC filter placement
   # BPH: Continue tamsulosin
   # GERD: Home PPI
   # HTN: Captopril for now
   # Spinal stenosis: Pain control with Tylenol

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on high-dose immunosuppression. He also has an enlarging sigmoid abscess, which was initially attempted to be drained by interventional radiology (IR) but was unsuccessful. The abscess cultures grew pseudomonas and bacteroides. The patient underwent a second IR drainage procedure, which was successful, and a drain was placed. He developed increasing oxygen requirements and more blood on suctioning, leading to his transfer back to the ICU for intubation. 

The patient's medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, RLS, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, BPH, GERD, and spinal stenosis. He is currently on hydrocortisone 500mg tid for pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, but due to increased hemoptysis, the dose is being decreased today. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: Continue Zosyn and appreciate ID recs. CT abdomen and pelvis to evaluate progression of sigmoid abscess. NPO and TPN for now. Given possibility of surgery, patient is currently off Cellcept and Rituxan. Also, attempted decreasing steroids but unable to given increased hemoptysis.
2. Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis: Currently on Hydrocortisone 500mg tid per rheumatology,"

   plasmapheresis with plans for continued plasmapheresis for 5 sessions
   (today is Day [**2-5**]); ionized calcium and LFTs ordered
   - Completed five day course of IVIG Monday
   # Pauci-Immune Pulmonary Vasculitis:  Currently on Hydrocortisone 500mg
   tid per rheumatology, given increased hemoptysis on attempted taper of
   steroids to 80mg TID.
   - Rheumatology okay
d decreasing dose today but in the setting of a
   worsened CXR in the left lung fields, will continue 500mg TID for now.
   Will re-evaluate after planned bronchoscopy today to evaluate infection
   vs. further bleed
   - Will also re-order sputum and blood cultures
   - Continues to be intubated for significant hemoptysis and hypoxemia.
   Spontaneous awakening trial today. Unable to wean FiO2 etc. yesterday
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Continue holding Cellcept and Rituxan given abscess; plasmapheresis
   per above
   - CBC every 8 hours to evaluate hematocrit
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   .
   # Multi-Organism Bacteremia:  GNR and GPC on blood cx from [**2-2**] grew out
   Morganella and Strep viridans.  BCx since are pending, NGTD.  Has been
   HD stable on linezolid and zosyn. Switched to Zosyn and added Cipro for
   double pseudomonas coverage. Sensitivity and speciation of abscess
   cultures showed resistance to Cipro, however, so patient only on Zosyn
   for now.
   - Continue Zosyn
   - Appreciate ID following
   - Follow-up strep viridans sensitivity if any
   - Daily blood cultures and one sputum culture today in setting of
   worsened CXR
   - Abscess management per below
   - Careful blood pressure, urine output, temperature monitoring for
   signs of SIRS/sepsis
   # Thrombocytopenia: Improved after two units of platelets yesterday.
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc consult. Patient responded well to 2 units of
   platelets, other serologies pending. Not DIC per Heme/Onc on peripheral

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PANCYTOPENIA: The patient's platelet count has been low, requiring platelet transfusion. Close monitoring of the patient's hematocrit and continued evaluation of the platelet count is necessary.
2. VASCULITIS: The patient has pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. This condition requires ongoing immunosuppression management. Steroids have been increased due to increased hemoptysis, and plasmapheresis has been initiated.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2
   requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Neutropenia & SIRS: Patient dropped WBC to 1.1 (94% neutrophils),
   mounted tachycardia 90s-100s, temperature of 99.6 which elevated for
   him, BP sank into 80s systolic, in setting of profound
   immunosuppression, s/p pheresis and with known sigmoid abscess. Picture
   c/w a systemic inflammatory response, vs. sepsis given he has a
   potential known source (sigmoid abscess, draining). Abscess shrinking
   per CT thanks to drain
 encouraging. Patient still immunosuppressed by
   steroids, plasmapheresis. CXR looks worse on left c/w increased
   bleeding (as we decrease steroids for his pulmonary vasculitis) or
   possible new VAP. Bolused 2 liters LR with good response to HR and BP
   Started Meropenem and Linezolid per ID recs in note
   -          Continue abx
   -          Continue steroids, but pull back hydrocortisone dose to 350
   mg TID (from 400)
   -          Bronch and BAL for culture
   -          F/u blood, urine cx
 VASCULITIS:  ANCA - negative pulmonary vasculitis treated with
   high-dose immunosuppression, now in a balancing act where
   immunosuppression reduction favors healing of abscess but also favors
   possibility of new pulmonary hemorrhaging. Using plasmapheresis as
2^nd immunosuppressive [**Doctor Last Name **]
 instead of his outpt Cellcept / Rituxan.
   s/p 5-day course of IVIg.
   -          Plasmapheresis on Friday, Tuesday
   -          Reducing steroids as per above
   -          Continue to monitor, sx
   -          Bronch will eval today
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides,
   abscess is smaller per latest CT.
   - Continue to monitor drain which is working to reduce abscess
   - NPO and TPN for now
   # Respiratory Status: Continues to have significant hemoptysis and
   hypoxemia. Unable to wean FiO2 below 60%, PS [**10-9**]. Now with mildly
   worsening CXR.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets again down to 37 overnight, transfused 1
   unit.
   -          F/u Heme/Onc recs
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] have additional transfusions prior to pheresis
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs increased Lantus and SSI.
   Will likely need again today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis and recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on high-dose immunosuppression. He is currently intubated for increasing oxygen requirement and has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess.

The patient's recent events include an increase in insulin regimen, completion of pheresis, and a CT scan showing a smaller abscess that is draining well. His blood culture and urine culture were obtained at 01:00 AM on 02/11/2112. He has been on neutropenic precautions due to a low white blood cell count (WBC) of 1.1. A platelet transfusion was ordered, and he started on Meropenem and Linezolid as per standing ID recommendations.

The patient has no known drug allergies. His current medications include propofol, fentanyl, hydralazine, and other ICU medications. His medical and family history is unchanged from admission except for the addition of type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which his insulin regimen was increased by Dr. [Last Name (un) 72].

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/62 mmHg to 146/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2
   requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Neutropenia & SIRS: Patient WBC was initially dropping but has
   improved in the last 24 hours and afebrile. Patient did have episodes
   of relative hypotension yesterday (SBP 100s) which is still consistent
   with borderline SIRS given patient immunosuppression and ongoing
   infection. Thus, captopril was discontinued. Abscess shrinking per CT
   thanks to drain
 encouraging. Patient still immunosuppressed by
   steroids,  getting plasmapheresis.
   - Continue Meropenem, will discontinue Flagyl now
   - Continue steroids but pull back hydrocortisone dose further to 300mg
   TID
   - Will touch base with patient
s primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   regarding plan and ?restarting immunemodulator
   - Follow-up bronch/BAL cultures, blood and urine cultures
 VASCULITIS:  ANCA - negative pulmonary vasculitis treated with
   high-dose immunosuppression, now in a balancing act where
   immunosuppression reduction favors healing of abscess but also favors
   possibility of new pulmonary hemorrhaging. Using plasmapheresis as
2^nd immunosuppressive [**Doctor Last Name **]
 instead of his outpt Cellcept / Rituxan.
   s/p 5-day course of IVIG. RNs continue to suction blood clots with
   secretions
 unclear if active bleeding or old blood collections
   -          Plasmapheresis today and Tuesday
   -          Reducing steroids as per above
   -          Continue to monitor, sx
   -          Re-check PM hematocrit
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides,
   abscess is smaller per latest CT.
   - Continue to monitor drain which is working to reduce abscess
   - NPO and TPN for now
   - Follow-up Surgery Recs - ?need to readjust drain placement per their
   last note
   # Respiratory Status: Continues to have bloody/clotted secretions and
   hypoxemia. Unable to wean FiO2 below 60%, PS [**10-9**].
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss and transfuse as
   needed
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets improving and bumping appropriately to
   transfusions
   -          F/u Heme/Onc recs
   -          CBC recheck this evening
    # Volume overload: Patient significantly volume up in the last 24-48
   hours (6L) likely in the setting of antibiotics, TPN and fluid boluses
   - Lasix 20mg IV X2
   - Re-check PM electrolytes
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs increased Lantus and SSI.
   Will likely need again today.
   # RLS: Continue ropinerole
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT with pulmonary embolization - s/p IVC filter placement
   # BPH: Continue tamsulosin
   # GERD: Home PPI
   # HTN:
   - Hold Captopril for event of hypotension (relative) o/n
   # Spinal stenosis: Pain control with Tylenol

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to have bloody/clotted secretions and hypoxemia, which indicates ongoing respiratory failure. They are unable to wean FiO2 below 60% and PS is [**10-9**]. This suggests a need for continued respiratory support.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet counts, which may increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and transfusion as needed are recommended.

3. Volume Overload: The patient has significantly increased fluid intake in the last 24-48 hours, leading to volume overload. Lasix has been prescribed to help manage this.

4. Sepsis: The patient is still considered immunosuppressed and has ongoing infection, as indicated by negative cultures and ongoing antibiotic treatment. SIRS criteria are borderline due to relative hypotension, indicating a potential risk for sepsis.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding). Blood transfusions may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.

6. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory status with bloody/clotted secretions and hypoxemia suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

7. Diverticulitis with Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2
   requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Neutropenia & SIRS: Patient dropped WBC to 1.1 (94% neutrophils),
   mounted tachycardia 90s-100s, temperature of 99.6 which elevated for
   him, BP sank into 80s systolic, in setting of profound
   immunosuppression, s/p pheresis and with known sigmoid abscess. Picture
   c/w a systemic inflammatory response, vs. sepsis given he has a
   potential known source (sigmoid abscess, draining). Abscess shrinking
   per CT thanks to drain
 encouraging. Patient still immunosuppressed by
   steroids, plasmapheresis. CXR looks worse on left c/w increased
   bleeding (as we decrease steroids for his pulmonary vasculitis) or
   possible new VAP. Bolused 2 liters LR with good response to HR and BP
   Started Meropenem and Linezolid per ID recs in note
   -          Continue abx
   -          Continue steroids, but pull back hydrocortisone dose to 350
   mg TID (from 400)
   -          Bronch and BAL for culture
   -          F/u blood, urine cx
 VASCULITIS:  ANCA - negative pulmonary vasculitis treated with
   high-dose immunosuppression, now in a balancing act where
   immunosuppression reduction favors healing of abscess but also favors
   possibility of new pulmonary hemorrhaging. Using plasmapheresis as
2^nd immunosuppressive [**Doctor Last Name **]
 instead of his outpt Cellcept / Rituxan.
   s/p 5-day course of IVIg.
   -          Plasmapheresis on Friday, Tuesday
   -          Reducing steroids as per above
   -          Continue to monitor, sx
   -          Bronch will eval today
   #.  Sigmoid Abscess:  Cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides,
   abscess is smaller per latest CT.
   - Continue to monitor drain which is working to reduce abscess
   - NPO and TPN for now
   # Respiratory Status: Continues to have significant hemoptysis and
   hypoxemia. Unable to wean FiO2 below 60%, PS [**10-9**]. Now with mildly
   worsening CXR.
   - Continue Bactrim ppx
   - Will monitor secretions closely for blood loss
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets again down to 37 overnight, transfused 1
   unit.
   -          F/u Heme/Onc recs
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] have additional transfusions prior to pheresis
   # Type 2 diabetes mellitus: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs increased Lantus and SSI.
   Will likely need again today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on high-dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2 requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. He has neutropenia, systemic inflammatory response, potential known source of sepsis (sigmoid abscess), and worsening CXR. He also has thrombocytopenia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, BPH, GERD, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's low WBC count, fever, tachycardia, and hypotension indicate a systemic inflammatory response, which could be due to an infection. The presence of a known sigmoid abscess adds to the concern of sepsis.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off FiO2 below 60% and the worsening CXR suggest respiratory failure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding.
4. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's history of recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage and worsening CXR raise concerns about a new episode of pulmonary hemorrhage.
5. Diverticulitis with Abscess: The presence of a sigmoid abscess requires close monitoring, and there is a risk"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with a history of sigmoid abscess and ANCA-negative vasculitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions, including respiratory status, thrombocytopenia, volume overload, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 115/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an APRV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The blood glucose level is elevated at 217 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and coagulation profile, are within normal range.

The patient has received multiple antibiotic treatments since admission, including piperacillin/tazobactam, linezolid, metronidazole, and meropenem.

The patient's abdominal drain shows a decrease in output, indicating improvement in the sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with less bloody secretions and stable oxygenation on APRV mode.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is being monitored, and there are no new developments regarding this condition.

Overall, the patient's condition appears to be stable, with ongoing management of respiratory status,"

   58 yo M with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis with recurrent pulmonary
   hemorrhage on high dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2
   requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Neutropenia & SIRS: Patient WBC was initially dropping but has
   improved in the last 24 hours and afebrile. Patient did have episodes
   of relative hypotension yesterday (SBP 100s) which is still consistent
   with borderline SIRS given patient immunosuppression and ongoing
   infection. Thus, captopril was discontinued. Abscess shrinking per CT
   thanks to drain
 encouraging. Patient still immunosuppressed by
   steroids,  getting plasmapheresis.
   - Continue Meropenem, will discontinue Flagyl now
   - Continue steroids but pull back hydrocortisone dose further to 300mg
   TID
   - Will touch base with patient
s primary pulmonologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
   regarding plan and ?restarting immunemodulator
   - Follow-up bronch/BAL cultures, blood and urine cultures
 VASCULITIS:  ANCA - negative pulmonary vasculitis treated with
   high-dose immunosuppression, now in a balancing act where
   immunosuppression reduction favors healing of abscess but also favors
   possibility of new pulmonary hemorrhaging. Using plasmapheresis as

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage on high-dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing oxygen requirement, and an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient has neutropenia, SIRS, thrombocytopenia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, diverticulitis with abscess, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient is immunosuppressed due to steroids and plasmapheresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient has a history of recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage. Continued immunosuppression reduction favors healing of abscess but also favors the possibility of new pulmonary hemorrhaging.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a sigmoid abscess that is currently being managed with percutaneous drainage. There is a risk of abscess rupture or worsening infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which requires close monitoring and transfusions as needed.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient is significantly volume overloaded, likely due to antibiotics, TPN, and fluid boluses. Lasix has been given to address this issue.
5. Infection: The patient has ongoing infection, as indicated by positive cultures for pseudomonas and bacteroides. There is a risk of further infection and sepsis.
6. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and transfusions as needed are important.
7. Diabetes Management: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed carefully with appropriate medications and close monitoring of blood glucose levels.
8. ICU-acquired complications: The patient is at risk for developing ICU-acquired complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures are in place, but close monitoring is essential."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis on high-dose immunosuppression. He is intubated for increasing oxygen requirement and has an IR-placed drain for management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status has improved with less hemoptysis and better oxygenation on APRV ventilation with FiO2 60%. There is a reduction in blood in secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient continues to have hypoxemia and is unable to wean FiO2 below 60%. Close monitoring of secretions for blood loss and transfusion as needed is necessary.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: The abscess is smaller per latest CT, but cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides. Continued monitoring of the drain and adjustment of placement if needed.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Platelets are improving, and transfusions have been given appropriately.
4. Volume Overload: The patient is significantly volume overloaded in the last 24-48 hours. Lasix has been given to address this issue, and PM electrolytes should be rechecked.
5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes management requires adjustment of Lantus and SSI as recommended by his primary physician.
6. Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS): Ropinerole should be continued for RLS.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis on high-dose immunosuppression. He is intubated for increasing oxygen requirements and has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status has improved with less hemoptysis and better oxygenation on APRV ventilation settings.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition can deteriorate, leading to respiratory failure due to the underlying pulmonary vasculitis and ongoing infection.
2. Sepsis: The presence of a sigmoid abscess and ongoing infection increases the risk of sepsis, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding complications.
4. Volume Overload: The patient has shown significant volume overload in the last 24-48 hours, which needs to be addressed to prevent complications like congestive heart failure.
5. Diabetes Management: The patient's type 2 diabetes mellitus requires careful management, including adjustments to insulin therapy as per recommendations from the primary care physician.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, with multiple potential complications that need close monitoring and appropriate management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis on high-dose immunosuppression. He is intubated for increasing oxygen requirement and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status improved with APRV vent settings and FiO2 60%. There are ongoing concerns regarding the patient's thrombocytopenia, volume overload, and other medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypertension, and spinal stenosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to worsening pulmonary vasculitis or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 47).
3. Fluid overload and heart failure due to ongoing positive fluid balance.
4. Infection recurrence or spread from the sigmoid abscess, especially with the presence of pseudomonas and bacteroides in cultures.
5. Poor glycemic control in a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin therapy.
6. Potential complications from long-term immunosuppression, such as increased susceptibility to infections.
7. Possible complications from the IVC filter placed for pulmonary embolization.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis on high-dose immunosuppression, intubated for increasing oxygen requirement, and with an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's medical conditions include pancypopenia, vasculitis, respiratory failure (acute), hemoptysis, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia (acute), anemia (acute secondary to blood loss), diverticulitis (abscess with percutaneous drain), type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (APRV) due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to worsening respiratory failure or the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sigmoid Abscess: Although the abscess has improved with drainage, there is still a risk of infection recurrence or worsening if the drain needs adjustment or if there are any complications related to the drainage procedure.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially during procedures or if there is any trauma.
4. Volume Overload: The patient is still 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis who is currently intubated and receiving respiratory support. He has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status has been stable overnight, with a FiO2 weaning to 50% and good oxygenation. His blood in secretions has reduced, and he is diuresing well with a better-looking chest X-ray. His creatinine levels are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a leaking drain around the tube site, indicating a possible complication related to the abscess. Close monitoring and further interventions, such as a CT abdomen/pelvis, may be necessary.

2. Rash: The patient has developed a large patch of redness across most of his right hip/buttock, which could be due to lying on his side. It needs to be monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken if it worsens or shows signs of infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count (44). If he undergoes any surgical or interventional procedures, consideration should be given to platelet transfusion.

4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's diabetes management requires careful monitoring of blood glucose levels and adherence to medication recommendations.

5. Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS): The patient is being treated with ropinerole for RLS, and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has a history of sigmoid abscess and ANCA-negative vasculitis. They are currently being treated in the ICU and have undergone various interventions. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. They are receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube connected to an APRV ventilator. The patient's blood glucose level is elevated at 50 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are mostly within normal range, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. Imaging studies reveal a smaller abscess, and the patient is being closely monitored for any complications or changes in condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a history of sigmoid abscess, which may lead to complications such as infection, sepsis, or worsening of the abscess if not properly managed.
2. Vasculitis: The patient has ANCA-negative vasculitis, which can cause inflammation and damage to blood vessels. This can result in organ damage or failure if not adequately controlled.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which carries the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to high pressures during ventilation.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which"

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who is currently intubated for increasing oxygen requirement. He has an IR-placed drain for management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status and vasculitis are stable, but he has several potential medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on APRV ventilation and has shown improvement in oxygenation. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to maintain adequate respiratory function.

2. Hemoptysis: The patient has experienced bleeding in secretions, which should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or massive hemoptysis.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's cultures are growing pseudomonas and bacteroides, indicating a bacterial infection. Antibiotic therapy with meropenem is ongoing, and additional measures such as plasmapheresis may be considered to address the infection.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count of 44, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and consideration of platelet transfusion before any invasive procedures will be important.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreased, likely secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage and abscess drainage. Blood product transfusions may be required to manage the anemia.

6. Diverticulitis: The patient has an abscess related to diverticulitis, which"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, intubated for increasing oxygen requirement, and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. He is currently doing well on APRV ventilation settings and his steroid regimen. The patient's respiratory status and vasculitis are stable, and he is diuresing well with stable creatinine. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications due to prolonged intubation and ventilation.
2. Infection from the IR-placed drain for sigmoid abscess management.
3. Thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 37, which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Potential for worsening of pulmonary vasculitis.
5. Possible complications related to immunosuppression.
6. Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
7. Risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility and prolonged hospitalization.
8. Need for careful glycemic control due to diabetes mellitus.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."

   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, intubated for
   increasing O2 requirement, with IR-placed drain for management of
   sigmoid abscess.
    # Respiratory Status & Vasculitis: Continuing to oxygenate  well. Not
   a lot of blood or secretions. Is he settling out due to good steroid
   and other immunosuppression regime (ie plasmapheresis) or because of
   his somewhat exotic APRV vent settings? Diuresing well with stable
   creatinine.
   - Wean off APRV to AC
   - Recheck ABG after wean
   - Continue Bactrim prophylaxis
   - Continue Hydrocortisone 300 mg Q8, do not wean for now
   - PM Hct
   - Lasix 20 mg IV again today to target 500-1,000 cc negative
   - PM lytes
    # Sigmoid abscess: On Meropenem day 6. Abscess was smaller by CT [**2-10**].
   Cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides. Drain leaking around
   tube. IR and surgery have evaluated latest CT scan, abscess is still
   shrinking in size and looking much better. They rec gently flushes and
   frequent dressing changes; may upsize drain on Tues.
   - Continue meropenem, steroids
   - Follow-up Surgery Recs
   # Rash: resolving. Nothing on CT of concern.
   - RN aware to monitor
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets 64.
   - transfuse for 50

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He was intubated for increasing oxygen requirement and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with good oxygenation and minimal blood or secretions. His creatinine levels are stable, indicating proper diuresis.

The patient's WBC count is within normal range, but his platelet count is low at 64. The levels of electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride are within normal limits. The patient's glucose level is elevated at 150, but other lab values including liver enzymes, kidney function tests, and blood gases are mostly within normal range.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension. These conditions are being managed with appropriate medications.

The patient is receiving TPN without lipids and has strict glycemic control with Lantus and Sliding Scale Insulin (SSI). He has multiple lines including a multi-lumen line, PICC line, arterial line, and pheresis catheter.

The patient is on full code status and communication with the family has been established.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical conditions including pulmonary vasculitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hemoptysis, bacteremia, acute thrombocytopenia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage, bleeding), diverticulitis with an abscess that is being managed with percutaneous drainage.

The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation with APRV settings. They are also on immunosuppression and a steroid regimen. The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. The patient's platelet count is low, indicating pancytopenia.

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome (RLS), anxiety, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolization and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hypertension.

The patient's current plan includes continuing with the current ventilator settings, weaning oxygen to 40%, rechecking arterial blood gas (ABG) after oxygen wean, continuing Bactrim prophylaxis, continuing hydrocortisone 300 mg every 8 hours, and not weaning for now, checking hemoglobin (Hct) levels, administering Lasix 20 mg"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, intubated for increasing O2 requirement, and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving as he continues to oxygenate well with stable creatinine levels. There is a plan to wean off APRV to AC and recheck ABG after the wean.
- The patient is diuresing well with stable creatinine levels. Lasix 20 mg IV will be given again today to target 500-1,000 cc negative fluid balance.
- The patient's sigmoid abscess is showing improvement with cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides. The drain is leaking around the tube, but IR and surgery have evaluated the latest CT scan, and the abscess is still shrinking in size.
- The patient has a resolving rash and no concerning findings on the CT scan.
- The patient's thrombocytopenia is being managed with platelet transfusion for 50.
- The patient has multiple medical conditions including type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome (RLS), anxiety, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and hypertension (HTN).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, currently intubated for increasing oxygen requirement, and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. 

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and on ventilator support. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to the underlying pulmonary vasculitis and the need for careful monitoring of ABG results.
2. Infection: The presence of a sigmoid abscess with cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides indicates a risk of infection. There is also mention of a leaking drain, which could potentially lead to further complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has a high bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic alkalosis, which may require treatment with diamox.
5. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient's electrolyte levels are slightly abnormal, indicating a need for close monitoring and possible correction.
6. Type 2 diabetes mellitus: The patient has diabetes, and glucose levels are mentioned, indicating a need for glycemic control management.
7. DVT with pulmonary embolization: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolization, and"

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, currently intubated for increasing oxygen requirement. He has an IR-placed drain for management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status and vasculitis are stable, with minimal blood/secretions and good diuresis. He is being weaned down to PSV mode on the ventilator. Cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides from the drain, but the abscess is shrinking in size. The patient's rash is resolving, thrombocytopenia is stable, and other medical conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, DVT with pulmonary embolization, benign prostatic hyperplasia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and hypertension are being managed with respective medications.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sigmoid abscess: The patient has a sigmoid abscess that was initially managed with an IR-placed drain. The abscess is still shrinking in size, but there is a risk of infection due to cultures growing pseudomonas and bacteroides. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia and is being transfused with platelets. Close monitoring of platelet levels and signs of bleeding is important.

3. Pulmonary vasculitis: The patient's underlying pulmonary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a sigmoid abscess and subsequent development of a DVT with PE. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and sedation, and various interventions have been performed to manage his condition. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, although there is mild edema noted on physical examination. Laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient's respiratory status is being monitored, and efforts are being made to wean off pressure support. Medications include fentanyl, propofol, lasix, solumedrol, and others as per physician recommendations. The patient's nutritional support is through TPN without lipids, and plans are to attempt tube feeds soon. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating a significant respiratory compromise. Weaning off pressure support and eventually extubation will be crucial to prevent further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The presence of a sigmoid abscess and the need for drain placement suggest an ongoing infectious process. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent worsening of the infection.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating thrombocytopenia. Continued monitoring of platelet levels and appropriate transfusion if necessary are important to prevent bleeding complications.

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and BPH. He was admitted to the ICU with a sigmoid abscess and sepsis secondary to a urinary tract infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and sedated. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 148/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has mild edema and his drain output is within normal limits.

The patient's laboratory values show leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 47 K/uL. His electrolytes are mostly within normal range, except for hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.2 mEq/L. The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. His glucose level is normal at 97 mg/dL.

The patient's current medications include fentanyl for pain management, hydralazine for blood pressure control, and lasix for fluid management. The patient is also receiving TPN without lipids for nutrition and a proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's plan includes continuing with the current management regimen,"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of insulin regimen, currently admitted to the ICU for a sigmoid abscess. The patient's medical history is significant for hypokalemia, which has been repleted. 

Overnight, the drain was removed, and the pheresis catheter and PICC line were also stopped. The patient received acetazolamide for metabolic alkalosis and continued on Lasix. The patient's intake and output are within normal limits. 

Laboratory values show a WBC count of 2.7, Hct of 22.1, and platelet count of 47. Other lab results are within normal range. 

Assessment and plan include respiratory status, where the patient will continue on a Lasix drip, and monitoring of fluids. The sigmoid abscess is improving, and the drain is working well. 

Nutrition is being provided through TPN without lipids at a rate of 63 mL/hour. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is unknown at this time."

- Acetazolamide was given for metabolic alkalosis, and lasix was continued.
- The patient's intake/output was recorded as +480 cc at midnight.
- Laboratory results showed stable levels of electrolytes except for hypokalemia, which was repleted.
- A CT-guided drain replacement was performed, and the abscess was found to be slightly smaller. The doctor recommended increasing drainage around the catheter and frequent dressing changes. The patient's viral culture on right groin skin breakdown/vesicle behind the right ear was checked.
- The patient's insulin regimen was reviewed by Dr. [Last Name (un)].
- Steroids were changed to solumedrol 60 mg Q8 per Dr. [Last Name (STitle)].
- Fentanyl and propofol infusions were ordered, but the patient was already off propofol all evening, so it was discontinued.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who presented to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including a sigmoid abscess, diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The patient had a nasogastric tube placed post-pyloric due to difficulty with nasal tubing secondary to a history of anxiety. The patient's abscess showed dramatic improvement on a CT scan, and it was decided to consider extubation today. The patient's vitals are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 to 160/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and awake, signaling readiness for extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient is currently on ventilatory support with CPAP/PSV mode, indicating a risk of respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or extubation failure.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: Although the abscess has shown improvement, there is still a risk of recurrent infection or worsening of the abscess.
3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored to prevent hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
4. Restless Leg Syndrome: The patient may experience discomfort or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there are several medical conditions and complications mentioned throughout the note.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU with an improved abscess, and the ID team recommends continuing the current antibiotic, [Last Name (un) 350], with DFA sent. The primary surgeon, [Last Name (un) 11624], is okay with starting total parenteral nutrition (TF). The patient's lytes are stable, and they have been prescribed lasix gtt by [Last Name (un)].

The patient has a history of anxiety and reluctance in using nasal tubing. There is also a mention of accidentally giving a Fentanyl bolus, which resulted in the patient stopping breathing and being switched to assist control ventilation at around 9 pm.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/55 mmHg to 160/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory system resistance (RSBI) of 15, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2)"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male who is currently admitted to the ICU. He has a history of multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, anxiety, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diverticulitis with abscess formation, pulmonary vasculitis, respiratory failure, hemoptysis, bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, and a deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 133/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and on assisted control ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypernatremia (high sodium): The patient has low potassium levels and high sodium levels. It is recommended to continue aggressive diuresis with lasix and provide TID lytes.
2. Pancytopenia: The patient has low white blood cell count, low red blood cell count, and low platelet count. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Vasculitis: The patient has pulmonary vasculitis, but ANCA testing is negative. The plan is to continue Solumedrol 60mg q8h and consult"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which may require mechanical ventilation support. Weaning from the ventilator and transitioning to pressure support should be monitored closely.

2. Pancytopenia: The patient has shown signs of low levels of white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), and platelets (PLT). This condition, known as pancytopenia, increases the risk of infections, anemia, and bleeding.

3. Vascularitis: The patient has been diagnosed with vasculitis, specifically negative pulmonary vasculitis. This condition involves inflammation of the blood vessels and can lead to organ damage if not properly managed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is experiencing acute thrombocytopenia, characterized by a critically low platelet count. This condition increases the risk of bleeding and hemorrhage.

5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss (hemorrhage). This condition can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and inadequate tissue perfusion.

6. Diverticulitis: The patient has an abscess related to diverticulitis, which may require surgical intervention and percutaneous drainage. Close monitoring for complications such as recurrent bleeding or infection is necessary.

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, extubated 12 hours
   ago after XX days on mechanical ventilation, with IR-placed drain for
   management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Sating in mid- to high-90s most of the night.
   Occasional dips into low 90s or high 80s that resolve when patient told
   to take a deep breath. Diuresed to goal of XX. No signs of pulmonary
   hemorrhage for several days now. Was initially hypertense (MAPs 110)
   after intubation but SBPs kept in 140s with nitro gtt.
   - Follow lytes and UOP
   - Continue Solumedrol 60mg q8h and will touch base with primary
   pulmonologist
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, drain is working. Has therefore
   had IR procedures from drainage, IVIG, plasmapheresis (x 5 including).

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis and immunosuppression. He was previously on mechanical ventilation for XX days and was extubated 12 hours ago. The patient has an IR-placed drain for management of a sigmoid abscess. 

The patient's respiratory status is generally stable, with oxygen saturation levels in the mid-to-high 90s most of the night. There have been occasional dips into the low 90s or high 80s, which resolve when the patient is instructed to take a deep breath. The patient's blood pressure has been well-controlled with nitro gtt.

The patient is being closely monitored for various conditions, including a sigmoid abscess, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. 

The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), a heart rate of 81 bpm, a blood pressure of 138/64 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 723 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 60%. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory status due to the underlying pulmonary condition, infection related to the sigmoid abscess, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, and further deterioration of kidney function. 

It is important to continue monitoring the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory results closely, as well as following the recommendations of the primary pulmonologist and other specialists involved in the patient's care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He was extubated 12 hours ago after 20 days on mechanical ventilation and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status is stable, with oxygen saturation in the mid-to-high 90s most of the night. There are occasional dips into the low 90s or high 80s, but they resolve when the patient is told to take a deep breath. The patient was initially hypertensive (MAPs 110) after intubation but SBPs are now in the 140s with nitro gtt.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory status: Continue monitoring oxygen saturation and provide supplemental oxygen as needed.
2. Sigmoid abscess: The drain is working well, and the abscess appears to be improving on CT. Continue antibiotics (Meropenem) and plan for surgery following plasmapheresis.
3. Shoulder pain: Provide pain management with lidocaine patch and acetaminophen, avoiding narcotics for now.
4. Thrombocytopenia: Maintain platelet count above 50K with transfusions if necessary.
5. Anemia: Monitor hemoglobin levels.
6. Diabetes Mellitus: Adjust insulin dosage according to [Last Name] recommendations.
7. Restless leg: Start ropinerole.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis who has been on immunosuppression. He was intubated and mechanically ventilated for approximately 20 days due to respiratory failure. The patient now has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/46 to 172/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on face tent with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The patient's physical examination reveals diffuse edema and the presence of a drain in place, draining feculent material. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium levels, and normal liver function tests. The patient's recent laboratory values have been stable.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of his medical conditions. His respiratory status has improved since extubation, with oxygen saturation ranging from mid to high 90s. The patient is being closely monitored for any signs of pulmonary hemorrhage. His blood pressure is being managed with nitroglycerin infusion, aiming for systolic blood pressure in the 140s. The healthcare team will continue to follow electrolyte levels and urine output. The patient is receiving Solu-Medrol 60"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a cool and mottled appearance to the left hand, no pain, tingling, numbness, weakness, or diminished pulses on examination. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/80 mmHg to 154/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving multiple medications including insulin, meropenem, pantoprazole, furosemide, and hydralazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's cool and mottled appearance to the left hand may indicate compromised blood flow to the extremity.
2. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed appropriately.
3. Hypokalemia (low potassium, hypopotassemia): The patient's laboratory results show a low potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance.
4. Pancytopenia: The patient's blood count results show low white blood cell count (3.6 K/uL), hemoglobin (8.0 g/dL), and platelet count (72 K/uL), suggesting a decrease in the number of"

   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, extubated 12 hours
   ago after XX days on mechanical ventilation, with IR-placed drain for
   management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Sating in mid- to high-90s most of the night.
   Occasional dips into low 90s or high 80s that resolve when patient told
   to take a deep breath. Diuresed to 4 liters, (goal [**3-3**]). No signs of
   pulmonary hemorrhage for several days now. Remains slightly
   hypertensive (SBP150s)
   - Follow lytes and UOP
   - Continue Solumedrol 60mg q8h
   - C/w bactrim ppx
   - Restart nitro gtt PRN (goal SBPs 140s)
   - Goal diuresis for today: Negative 2 liters, as HR starting to creep
   up after aggressive diuresis. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, drain is working. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Will try to un-occlude Dobhoff
 if unsuccessful, consider resumption
   of TPN given patient
s dislike of nasal tubing
   # Shoulder pain: has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Usually
   takes darvocet at home.
   - lidocaine patch & standing acetaminophen; avoid narcotics as much as
   possible
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable.
   - Transfuse to maintain 50K
   # Anemia: Stable.
   # DM: Only gave half of his long-acting insulin o/n in setting of TPN
   and TFs both off in the hours after extubation.
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Restless leg: Ropinerole
   # BPH: Flomax
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT w/ PE: Has IVC filter in place
   # Hypertension: Restarted Sotalol with good effect

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression who was recently extubated after being on mechanical ventilation for XX days. The patient has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Alteration in tissue perfusion: The patient's arterial line stopped at one point, which could indicate a potential issue with blood flow and tissue perfusion.

2. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient has been experiencing shoulder pain, which is a chronic issue due to a rotator cuff injury. There is also mention of treating acute pain, suggesting that the patient may be experiencing new or additional sources of pain.

3. Hypokalemia (low potassium, hypotasmia): The patient's laboratory results show a low potassium level of 3.4 mEq/L, indicating a potential electrolyte imbalance.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient's white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are all within normal ranges, but there is mention of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which could be a contributing factor to pancytopenia.

5. Vasculitis: The patient has pulmonary vasculitis, indicating inflammation of the blood vessels in the lungs.

6. Alteration in nutrition: The patient is receiving tube"

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, extubated 12 hours
   ago after XX days on mechanical ventilation, with IR-placed drain for
   management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Satting in mid- to high-90s most of the night.
   Occasional dips into low 90s or high 80s that resolve when patient told
   to take a deep breath. Diuresing excellently over past several days. No
   signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for several days now
   - C/w nasal cannula and face mask oxygen therapy
   - Goal diuresis today 2-4 liters negative
   - Follow PM lytes and UOP
   - Continue Solumedrol 60mg q8h
   - C/w bactrim ppx
   - Restart nitro gtt PRN (goal SBPs 140s)
   - Goal diuresis for today: Negative 2 liters, as HR starting to creep
   up after aggressive diuresis. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, drain is working. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   # Shoulder pain: has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Usually
   takes darvocet at home. Need to be conservative with narcotics, given
   tenuous respiratory status
   - consider fentanyl boluses/patch
   # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pules and capillary refill but hand significantly cool to
   touch. Likely has adequate collateral circulation from ulnar artery
   - Ask vascular surgery to look at hand
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable.
   - Transfuse to maintain 50K
   # Anemia: Stable.
   # DM: Only gave half of his long-acting insulin o/n in setting of TPN
   and TFs both off in the hours after extubation.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He was extubated 12 hours ago after being on mechanical ventilation for XX days and has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's respiratory status is stable with oxygen saturation in the mid-to-high 90s most of the night, occasional dips into low 90s or high 80s that resolve when the patient takes a deep breath. He is diuresing well over the past several days with no signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for several days now.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory status is stable, but there is a possibility of further respiratory complications due to his underlying condition of pulmonary vasculitis and recent mechanical ventilation.

2. Infection: The patient has an IR-placed drain for the management of sigmoid abscess, which increases the risk of infection. He is also on meropenem, an antibiotic, indicating the presence of an active infection.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 54 K/uL. This could be due to the underlying disease or as a result of medications he is receiving.

4. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of sigmoid abscess with an IR-placed drain. The patient requires respiratory support with FiO2 60-80% via face tent and nasal cannula due to his nosebreathing habit. His diuresis goal is to achieve 2 more liters negative. The patient's electrolytes and urine output should be monitored, and he will continue receiving Solumedrol 60mg q8h and ciprofloxacin prophylaxis.

Regarding the sigmoid abscess, the patient has undergone CT imaging, drain placement, IVIG, plasmapheresis (x5), and is currently on meropenem as per ID recommendations. Surgery is planned following the patient's recovery.

The patient also experiences chronic shoulder pain from a rotator cuff injury, for which he takes darvocet at home. However, he denies any shoulder pain this morning, and a fentanyl patch will be added.

There is mottling on the patient's left hand, which is a result of radial line removal after an indwelling period of 12 days. Despite this, the patient has good pulse and capillary refill, suggesting adequate collateral circulation from the ulnar artery. Vascular surgery has assessed the patient and is signing off. Continued monitoring of the left hand is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess, for which an indwelling drain was placed. The patient is experiencing respiratory distress requiring high-flow oxygen therapy and diuretics. There are concerns about possible complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient also has a history of chronic shoulder pain, left hand mottling suggestive of livedo reticularis, and previous deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, anxiety, and hypertension. The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including immunosuppressants, steroids, antibiotics, and anticoagulants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient's history of pulmonary vasculitis increases the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage, which can be life-threatening. Monitoring for bloody oral secretions is recommended.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating thrombocytopenia. Transfusion of platelets is planned to maintain a platelet count of 50,000.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, leading to anemia. A transfusion of packed red blood cells is planned to maintain a hemoglobin level above "

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed drain
   for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled intravascularly
   at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for several days now.
   Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
 he is
   nosebreather.
   - C/w nasal cannula and face mask oxygen therapy
 will try to wean
   down, knowing patient requires 5L NC at baseline
   - Goal diuresis today 2 more liters negative
   - PM lytes and UOP
   - Continue Solumedrol 60mg q8h
   - C/w bactrim ppx
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, drain is working although
   leaking around site. Has had IVIG, plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery
   following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   # Shoulder pain: has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses, denies shoulder pain this AM.
   - Shoulder film xrays
   - Continue Tylenol standing and Lidocaine path
   - Will try Fentanyl PCA with low basal dose today for self-monitoring
   of analgesia
    # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pulse and cap refill. Likely has adequate collateral
   circulation from ulnar. Vascular surgery has assessed, signed off.
   Pattern on hand suggestive of livedo reticularis, however, which is
   seen in vasculopathy but also in vasculitis. Concern in setting of
   increased respiratory requirements, dropping Hct/Platelets that
   patient
s pauci-immune vasculitis is re-flaring.
   - Repeat CXR today
   - Consider increasing steroids again
   - Close monitoring for bloody oral secretions
   # Thrombocytopenia: From 54 -> 43.
   - Transfuse today to maintain 50K
   # Anemia: Continuing to slide down daily, from 24->23->22.6->20.6.
   - Transfuse today to maintain above 20.
   # DM: Getting long acting and sliding scale.
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # FEN: Dobhoff clogged despite attempts to flush. Will try again today.
   Sounds like swallowing okay. Speech & swallow consult for ?PO feeds
   # Restless leg: Ropinerole
   # BPH: Flomax
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but he requires high-flow oxygen therapy and diuretics. His laboratory results show moderate growth of Enterococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a wound culture. The patient has been treated with IVIG and plasmapheresis for his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient has pulmonary vasculitis, which increases the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early recognition of symptoms such as bloody oral secretions is important.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: Although the abscess appears to be improving, there is still a risk of complications such as recurrent infection or perforation. Continued monitoring and follow-up with surgery are necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, indicating a potential risk of bleeding. Transfusion of platelets may be required to maintain an adequate platelet count.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is decreasing, indicating a risk of anemia. Blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain an adequate hemoglobin level.
5. Infection: The presence of Enterococcus sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the wound"

   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed drain
   for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up slightly. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for
   several days now. Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
   he is nosebreather. Possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.) and
   sedating medications.
   - C/w nasal cannula and face mask oxygen therapy
 will try to wean
   down, knowing patient requires 5L NC at baseline
   - Trial CPAP this morning, positioned upright in chair
   - Repeat CXR this morning
   - Goal diuresis today [**1-2**] more liters negative
   - PM lytes and UOP
   - Currently Solumedrol 50mg q8h
 will d/w primary pulmonologist re:
   resuming higher dose
   - C/w bactrim ppx
   - Pt expressing desires to go home, will discuss in further detail
   goals of care with patient, family and primary pulmonologist later
   today
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, drain is working although
   leaking around site and has cracked component. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Touch base with IR
   # Shoulder pain: Has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses yesterday although continues to
   c/o some pain.
   - Continue Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch
   - Continue with Fentanyl q2hr and monitor for sedation
    # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pulse and cap refill. Likely has adequate collateral
   circulation from ulnar. Vascular surgery has assessed, signed off.
   Pattern on hand suggestive of livedo reticularis, however, which is
   seen in vasculopathy but also in vasculitis. Concern in setting of
   increased respiratory requirements, dropping Hct/Platelets that
   patient
s pauci-immune vasculitis is re-flaring.
   - Consider increasing steroids again
   - Close monitoring for bloody oral secretions (so far negative)
   - Serial exams
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stable at 57 today
   - Transfuse to maintain 50K
   # Anemia: Hct 25 after transfusion of pRBC yesterday
   - Transfuse to maintain above 20.
   # DM: Getting long acting and sliding scale.
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # FEN: Dobhoff newly placed yesterday. Speech & swallow consulted for
   ?PO feeds
   # Restless leg: Ropinerole
   # BPH: Flomax
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT w/ PE: Has IVC filter in place
   # Hypertension: Restarted Sotalol with good effect

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Respiratory status: The patient requires FiO2 60-80% face tent and 6 L nasal cannula oxygen therapy. He is experiencing high oxygen saturation levels in the 90s. The patient's respiratory support is currently being weaned, but he requires ongoing assistance.

2. Sigmoid abscess: The patient has a drain in place for the management of sigmoid abscess. Although the abscess appears to be improving, there is a concern about the cracked component of the drain, which is causing leakage.

3. Left hand mottling: The patient has developed mottling on his left hand, which is suggestive of livedo reticularis. This pattern can be seen in vasculopathy and vasculitis. Given the patient's history of pauci-immune vasculitis and increasing respiratory requirements, there is a concern that the patient's vasculitis may be flaring again.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is currently stable at 57. It is important to monitor the platelet count closely and consider transfusion to maintain a level above 50K.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is currently at 25"

   for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up slightly. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for
   several days now. Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
   he is nosebreather. Possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.) and
   sedating medications. Tolerated CPAP well yesterday with subjective
   improvement in oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Continue with CPAP overnight
   - Repeat diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV X1-2 today with goal of negative 2
   liters
   - PM lytes and monitor urine output
   - Currently Solumedrol 125mg IV q8h in discussions with primary

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who underwent an IR-placed Year for the management of a sigmoid abscess. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Status: The patient requires FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula, and possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.). There is a concern for extravascular fluid accumulation and pulmonary hemorrhage. Tolerated CPAP well yesterday with subjective improvement in oxygenation/ventilation.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a CT scan showing improvement, but there is still leakage around the site of the abscess. The IR plans to replace and upsizing of the Year.
3. Elevated LFTs: Direct bilirubin 1.2 suggestive of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Concern for hemolysis.
4. Shoulder Pain: The patient has chronic pain from a rotator cuff injury and takes darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses yesterday although continues to c/o some pain.

   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed [**Year (4 digits) **]
   for management of sigmoid abscess.
    # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up slightly. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for
   several days now. Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
   he is nosebreather. Possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.) and
   sedating medications. Tolerated CPAP well yesterday with subjective
   improvement in oxygenation/ventilation. Concern for worsening
   vasculitis (less likely), fluid overload, hypercarbia from body
   habitus, infection (given leukocytosis), fatigue (not sleeping well at
   night Xdays given anxiety)
   - Add differential to CBC
   - Continue to encourage BiPap
   - ABG this morning
   - Repeat diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV X1-2 today with goal of negative 2
   liters
   - PM lytes and monitor urine output
   - Currently Solumedrol 80mg IV QID in discussions with primary
   pulmonologist
   - Will position patient as upright in bed as possible
   - Will consider broadening antibiotics to empirically cover for HAP:
   Vanc/Cipro
   - C/w bactrim ppx
 consider Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in setting
   of recent high dose steroids; will send betaglucan
   - Discuss with respiratory therapy whether patient could tolerate
   sputum induction for PCP and gram stain/culture
   - Pt expressing desires to go home, felt likely due to component of ICU
   delirium given prolonged hospitalization
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, [**Year (4 digits) **] is working although
   leaking around site and has cracked component
 went down to IR this
   morning for replacement and upsizing of [**Year (4 digits) **]. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   - Also ordered for repeat Cdiff toxin today
   # Elevated LFTs: Direct bilirubin 1.2 suggestive of unconjugated
   hyperbilirubinemia
   - Concern for hemolysis
 ordered repeat haptoglobin, fibrinogen,
   reticulocyte, LDH
   - Will touch base with Heme/Onc for peripheral smear review and concern
   of systemic vasculitis
   # Shoulder pain: Has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses yesterday although continues to
   c/o some pain.
   - Continue Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch
   - Continue with Fentanyl q2hr and monitor for sedation; will have RN
   actively offer analgesia q2 hours for closer management
   - Reverse trendelenberg and will have patient positioned as upright as
   possible
   .
    # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pulse and cap refill. Likely has adequate collateral
   circulation from ulnar. Vascular surgery has assessed, signed off.
   Pattern on hand suggestive of livedo reticularis, however, which is
   seen in vasculopathy but also in vasculitis. Concern in setting of
   increased respiratory requirements, dropping Hct/Platelets that
   patient
s pauci-immune vasculitis is re-flaring.
   - Close monitoring for bloody oral secretions (so far negative)
   - Serial exams
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably low
   - Transfuse to maintain 40-50K
   # Anemia: Hct ~25 after transfusion of pRBC three days ago
   - Transfuse to maintain above 20.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who had an initial placement of a sigmoid abscess for management. He is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing respiratory distress, requiring high-flow nasal cannula oxygen and CPAP/PSV ventilation. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 128/66 to 153/83 mmHg. The patient's heart rate has been elevated, ranging from 120 to 150 bpm. His oxygen saturation is low at 85%. The patient has shown improvement in oxygenation/ventilation when using CPAP. 

The patient's labs show leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. His liver enzymes are elevated, and there is a concern for hemolysis. He has been receiving IVIG, plasmapheresis, and antibiotics for his sigmoid abscess. 

The patient's shoulder pain is chronic, and he has received fentanyl boluses for pain management. There is mottling on his left hand, which may be due to livedo reticularis seen in vasculopathy or vasculitis. 

The patient has several other medical issues, including diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension.

   - Put out well to Lasix 80mg IV X1
   - Switched to Nutren Pulmonary TF (saving ~500cc extra volume!)
   - [**Last Name (un) 72**] rec'd incr fixed doses [**Hospital1 **]
   - PICC ordered
   - Surgery: Fistulization on [**Hospital1 **] imaging this morning with IR (fixed
   cracked [**Hospital1 **], upsized), which is good thing (natural drainage tract).
   :)
   - TBili 4.2, DBili 1.2, Hapto 70, Retic 7%, LDH1100; coombs and
   fibrinogen pending
   - [**Doctor Last Name 104**]: Decrease steroids 80mg IV qid today --> 60 if stable
   tomorrow. Touched base w/ Heme/Onc for peripheral smear review. If
   schistocytes, concern that vasculitis is worsening. They rec'd
   repeating hemolysis labs and peripheral smear in AM and re-paging them.
   - Very anxious on Bipap - not slept in 2+ days. Gave Seroquel 50 in
   addition to Trazodone 50...

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed [**Year (4 digits) **]
   for management of sigmoid abscess.
    # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up slightly. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for
   several days now. Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
   he is nosebreather. Possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.) and
   sedating medications. Tolerated CPAP well yesterday with subjective
   improvement in oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Continue with CPAP overnight
   - Repeat diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV X1-2 today with goal of negative 2
   liters
   - PM lytes and monitor urine output
   - Currently Solumedrol 125mg IV q8h in discussions with primary
   pulmonologist. Given stable, ?improved CT chest this AM, will touch
   base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**] re: lowering dose
   - C/w bactrim ppx
   - Pt expressing desires to go home, felt likely due to component of ICU
   delirium given prolonged hospitalization
   # Sigmoid Abscess: On CT looks better, [**Last Name (STitle) **] is working although
   leaking around site and has cracked component
 went down to IR this
   morning for replacement and upsizing of [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   # Elevated LFTs: Direct bilirubin 1.2 suggestive of unconjugated
   hyperbilirubinemia
   - Concern for hemolysis
 will order haptoglobin, fibrinogen,
   reticulocyte, LDH
   - Consider touching base with Heme/Onc for peripheral smear review
   # Shoulder pain: Has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses yesterday although continues to
   c/o some pain.
   - Continue Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch
   - Continue with Fentanyl q2hr and monitor for sedation
   - Shoulder films today
    # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pulse and cap refill. Likely has adequate collateral
   circulation from ulnar. Vascular surgery has assessed, signed off.
   Pattern on hand suggestive of livedo reticularis, however, which is
   seen in vasculopathy but also in vasculitis. Concern in setting of
   increased respiratory requirements, dropping Hct/Platelets that
   patient
s pauci-immune vasculitis is re-flaring.
   - Close monitoring for bloody oral secretions (so far negative)
   - Serial exams
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably low
   - Transfuse to maintain 50K
   # Anemia: Hct ~25 after transfusion of pRBC two days ago
   - Transfuse to maintain above 20.
   # DM: Getting long acting and sliding scale.
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # FEN: Dobhoff newly placed yesterday. Speech & swallow consulted for
   ?PO feeds
   # Restless leg: Ropinerole
   # BPH: Flomax
   # Anxiety: Continue SSRI
   # DVT w/ PE: Has IVC filter in place

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed [**Year (4 digits) **]
   for management of sigmoid abscess.
   # Respiratory status: Diuresing well with no real creatinine bump but
   HR creeping up slightly. Expect extravascular fluid to be pulled
   intravascularly at this point. No signs of pulmonary hemorrhage for
   several days now. Requiring FiO2 60-80% face tent, 6 L nasal cannula
   he is nosebreather. Possibly over-cannulated airways (Dobhoff etc.) and
   sedating medications. Tolerated CPAP well yesterday with subjective
   improvement in oxygenation/ventilation.
   - Continue with CPAP overnight
   - Repeat diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV X1-2 today with goal of negative 2
   liters
   - PM lytes and monitor urine output
   - Currently Solumedrol 125mg IV q8h in discussions with primary
   pulmonologist. Given stable, ?improved CT chest this AM, will touch
   base with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 104**] re: lowering dose
   - C/w bactrim ppx

   leaking around site and has cracked component
 went down to IR this
   morning for replacement and upsizing of [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Has had IVIG,
   plasmapheresis (x 5).  Surgery following. On Meropenem.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   # Elevated LFTs: Direct bilirubin 1.2 suggestive of unconjugated
   hyperbilirubinemia
   - Concern for hemolysis
 will order haptoglobin, fibrinogen,
   reticulocyte, LDH
   - Consider touching base with Heme/Onc for peripheral smear review
   # Shoulder pain: Has chronic pain from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. Got Fentanyl boluses yesterday although continues to
   c/o some pain.
   - Continue Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch
   - Continue with Fentanyl q2hr and monitor for sedation
   - Shoulder films today
    # Left hand mottling: s/p radial line removal after indwelling x 12
   days. Good pulse and cap refill. Likely has adequate collateral
   circulation from ulnar. Vascular surgery has assessed, signed off.
   Pattern on hand suggestive of livedo reticularis, however, which is
   seen in vasculopathy but also in vasculitis. Concern in setting of
   increased respiratory requirements, dropping Hct/Platelets that
   patient
s pauci-immune vasculitis is re-flaring.
   - Close monitoring for bloody oral secretions (so far negative)

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a drain placed for management of a sigmoid abscess and is receiving treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient experienced desaturation to the 80s yesterday and was put back on CPAP. He required reintubation and is currently agitated, moaning, and thrashing. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 119 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/101 to 161/113 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on high-flow nasal cannula and receiving medications such as lorazepam, fentanyl, and solute. The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of hemolysis with elevated bilirubin, LDH, and reticulocyte count. The patient also has chronic pain from a rotator cuff injury and has been taking darvocet at home. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent episode of desaturation to the 80s and agitation while on CPAP indicates potential respiratory failure. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilatory support may be required.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a drain placed"

   He was not diuresed aggressively yesterday for the first time, and was
   +700 cc for the day, even for LOS. Concern for worsening vasculitis
   (less likely), infection, fatigue (not sleeping well at night 3 days
   given anxiety).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a drain placed for the management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient experienced desaturation to the 80s yesterday and was put back on CPAP. The family was informed that reintubation may be necessary. The patient's ECG showed ST elevation in the high lateral leads, consistent with strain pattern. Troponin levels are falling. The patient's drain is now producing frank blood mixed with stool drainage, and surgery has been consulted. The patient's hemolysis labs show elevated direct bilirubin, LDH, reticulocyte count, and nucleated RBCs, suggesting hemolysis and brisk marrow response. However, haptoglobin levels are not low, and the patient is pancytopenic. The patient's shoulder pain has been managed with Fentanyl boluses, and he will continue with Fentanyl q2hr. The patient's livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, anxiety, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, hypertension, and glycemic control will also be addressed. The patient's code status remains full code for now, and further discussion is needed. The patient will continue to be monitored in the ICU."

   CRITICAL CARE ATTENDING
   I saw and examined Mr. [**Known lastname 5979**] with the ICU team, whose note from
   today reflects my input. I would add/emphasize that this 58-year-old
   man with pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis now has sigmoid abscess
   presumably from ruptured diverticulum.  Overall plan has been to
   attempt steroid-sparing measures and to attempt to pursue non-operative
   drainage.  Has therefore had IR procedures for drainage, IVIG,
   plasmapheresis.
   Steroids weaned.
   This morning, looks distressed.  Tachypneic.  Denies dyspnea, endorses
   should pain.
   Regular heart
   Distant lungs with crackles

   Continues to tolerate extubation, but very distressed last night with

   steroids.  Will use intermittent mask ventilation as needed.  Will
   discuss with consultants and primary pulmonologist about whether
   addition of other antimicrobials would be beneficial
 not clear that
   there is evidence of new infection at this point. Follow up beta
   glucan.  If positive, consider rx for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) 1763**] to tolerate induced
   sputum or bronch at present, and seems low-probability given ongoing
   prophylaxis.  Although PE is a possible etiology, he has an IVC filter
   already in place and anticoagulation is contraindicated given pulmonary
   hemorrhage.
   D/C cipro, since relatively unlikely to add coverage over and above
   meropenem, increases QTc, and may contribute to delirium.
   Zyprexa or haldol if needed, but not at present.  Pain control.
   Discussed with surgical attending; will follow drain output (more
   sanguinous) for now.
   Await further hematology impressions about his complex smear and
   hematologic issues.
   When improved, change to PICC.
   PPI. No anticoagulation.  Boots.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, who is now experiencing respiratory distress and has been admitted to the ICU. He has a sigmoid abscess, likely due to a ruptured diverticulum. The patient's vital signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. He is on non-invasive ventilation and receiving various medications, including steroids, which have been weaned. The patient's blood work shows pancytopenia, anemia with nucleated reds, elevated liver enzymes, and other abnormalities. He also has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. The patient is delirious and experiencing shoulder pain and left hand mottling. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a potential risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and continued support with non-invasive ventilation are necessary.
2. Sigmoid abscess: The presence of a sigmoid abscess may lead to further complications such as sepsis or perforation if not managed appropriately.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the key information:

- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, and chronic anemia.
- The patient presented with altered mental status, oliguria/anuria, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and a possible abscess with percutaneous drain.
- Laboratory results indicate pancytopenia (low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated creatinine, and abnormal coagulation profile (PTT/INR).
- The patient has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management medications.
- There have been attempts to identify the cause of hemolysis, including ruling out disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
- The patient's respiratory support has included CPAP and high-flow nasal cannula, with ongoing efforts to manage their ventilation and gas exchange.
- The patient's nutritional needs are being addressed with a pulmonary diet.
- There is ongoing monitoring and management of the patient's pain, delirium, and other symptoms.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is consistently mentioned as impaired"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has an IR-placed drain for the management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory status, agitation, cardiac artery disease, sigmoid abscess, anemia, livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, and coronary artery disease.

The patient's recent events include desaturation to 80s, tachypnea, and being put back on CPAP. The patient's lab results show elevated bilirubin levels, elevated LDH, reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, and signs of hemolysis. The haptoglobin level is not low, and there is no evidence of DIC or TTP. The patient's troponin T levels are falling, and there is a strain pattern on the ECG. The patient's platelet count is stable but low, and the patient has been transfused with packed red blood cells.

The patient's medications include Vancomycin, Meropenem, fentanyl, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and glargine. The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Ciprofloxacin on 02:00 AM on 02/26/2112, Vancomycin on 08:07 PM on 02/26/2112, and Meropenem on 04:05 AM on 02/27/2112.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's CVP is at zero, and he is not being diuresed further. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,245 mL and output of 1,075 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,170 mL.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished and overweight/obese appearance, normal eye findings, normal cardiovascular examination, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen with distension, and bilateral lower extremity edema.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory status with desaturation to 80s, agitation, cardiac artery disease, sigmoid abscess, anemia, livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus type II, obstructive sleep apnea, and coronary artery disease. The patient is on Vancomycin for empiric HAP, on Bactrim for prophylaxis, and has a drain producing frank blood mixed with stool drainage. The patient is scheduled for surgery to address the sigmoid abscess, and there is a possibility of a fist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess. He is currently on high-flow oxygen, BiPAP, and receiving IV medications including Vancomycin for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia, Bactrim for prophylaxis, Lasix for diuresis, and steroids for his underlying condition. The patient's respiratory status has been fluctuating, with episodes of desaturation and tachypnea. He is also experiencing agitation, delirium, and pain. The patient's heme picture is confusing, showing signs of hemolysis but without evidence of microangiopathy or DIC. He has a history of chronic shoulder pain, livedo reticularis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes, and restless leg syndrome. The patient has multiple comorbidities including CAD, sigmoid abscess, DVT with PE, hypertension, and BPH. He is currently receiving various prophylactic treatments and is on a feeding tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's fluctuating respiratory status and desaturation episodes indicate the risk of respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient is on multiple antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and abscess, suggesting the possibility of ongoing or recurring infections.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's lab results show signs of hemolysis"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with pauci-immune vasculitis who was admitted with a sigmoid abscess/diverticulitis. He underwent an intubation procedure and experienced a flare of pulmonary hemorrhage due to decreased steroids. The patient was reintubated and then extubated one week ago. Currently, he is delirious for unclear reasons, possibly due to pain or ICU delirium. The patient's medical history includes immunosuppressants, and his review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent delirium.

24-hour events:
The patient received various medications including antibiotics (Ciprofloxacin, Meropenem, Vancomycin), pantoprazole, fentanyl, lorazepam, and others. He also received nystatin, sotolol, paxil, ropinoral, tamsulosin, iron supplements, medrol, and bactrim.

Vital signs:
The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F) with a current temperature of 35.6°C (96°F). His heart rate is 103 bpm (98-116 bpm), blood pressure ranges from 114/65 mmHg to 151/94 mmHg, respiratory rate is 32 breaths per minute (21-39 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation is 93%. The patient has sinus tachycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed drain
   for management of sigmoid abscess
   # Hypotension & Fever: Hypotensive to 90s/60s this AM, tachy to 120s,
   fever 100.4, CVP of 2, in setting of blood in drain, b/l anemia and
   thrombocytopenia, dramatic (for him) white count, newly altered MS,
   cold legs. On Vanco for empiric HAP. On Bactrim for ppx. Also Meropenem
   coverage (for sigmoid abscess / GNRs), started Fluconazole [**2-27**]. Looks
   septic.
   - Fluid bolus this AM
   - Pan culture, beta gluc
   - CXR
   - Broaden his Abx coverage
   - ID c/s
   # Respiratory status: Panting / moaning. CXR normal. No increased
   secretions.  Decreased Steroids to Solumedrol 100mg IV q8. On BiPAP
   o/n? He may need reintubated today for agitation / altered mental
   status
 if so will he be extubatable?
   - check AM ABG in setting of tachypnea
   - On Vanco for empiric HAP. On Bactrim for ppx. Also Meropenem coverage
   (for sigmoid abscess / GNRs)
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix 80mg IV X1-2 today with goal of negative
   2 liters ???
   - PM lytes and monitor urine output
   - slowly taper steroids, given stable respiratory status
   - F/u cultures
   - Reverse trendelenberg and will have patient positioned as upright as
   possible
   # Agitation: Appears acutely delirious
 now nonverbal. Calling out
   unintelligibly today despite starting Methadone 5mg (for ?pain), Zydis,
   Ativan PRN. Differential: ICU delirium vs. prolonged anxiety/fatigue
   vs. respiratory distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis vs. cerebral
   vasculitis
   - c/w ativan PRN
   - CT head to evaluate for cerebral involvement of vasculitis: Probably
   not, his AMS seems c/w pain & agitation
   - wean steroids as possible
   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. D/c
d Fentanyl and started Methadone 5 mg PO
   yesterday. Also on Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch. No tachy,
   moaning
   - Pain management consult
   # Sigmoid Abscess: Less bloody drainage. Surgery following. On
   Meropenem, Vanc. Blood in drain possibly [**2-2**] recent manipulation.
   Fistula developing on recent imaging.
   - Continue Meropenem per ID recs
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   # Heme: Confusing heme picture. He has elevated indirect bili, LDH,
   reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, picture c/w hemolysis and brisk
   marrow response. But haptoglobin initially not low, and pancytopenic
   generally. Heme/onc review of smear: No evidence of DIC, TTP or
   microangiopathy.
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   - LENI
s to r/o DVT as source of elevated LDH: Could not be done well
   but showed nothing
   - resend haptoglobin (< 5 on recent lab)
   - f/u G6PD level
   - urine hemosiderin
   # Livedo reticularis: Noted on L hand and on legs at times, not active
   now.
   - Serial exams
   .
   # CAD:  ECG during period of agitation: ST dep in high lateral leads,
   c/w strain pattern. Trops falling.
   - no further trending
   - AM ECG today
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably low
   - Transfuse to maintain 40-50K
   # Anemia: Hct ~25 after transfusion of pRBC three days ago

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression.
- He has an IR-placed drain for management of a sigmoid abscess.
- The patient presented with hypotension, fever, and altered mental status.
- He is currently on vancomycin for empirical hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis, and meropenem coverage for the sigmoid abscess and gram-negative rods.
- The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with panting and moaning. He may need reintubation if agitation and altered mental status persist.
- There are concerns about the source of blood in the drain, possibly related to recent manipulation, and a fistula developing on recent imaging.
- The patient's heme picture shows signs of hemolysis and brisk marrow response, but without evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or microangiopathy.
- Livedo reticularis is noted on the patient's left hand and legs.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, anemia, diabetes mellitus, and restless legs syndrome.
- He is receiving aggressive pain management with methadone, Tylenol, Lidocaine patch, and a pain management consult.
- Other issues include anxiety, benign prostatic hyperplasia, restless legs syndrome, and a history of deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid abscess: The patient has a drain in place for the management of a sigmoid abscess. The blood in the drain may indicate ongoing infection or recent manipulation. There is also concern for a developing fistula.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with panting, moaning, and potential need for reintubation. This could be due to infection, fluid overload, or respiratory muscle weakness.
3. Hemolysis: The patient's heme picture suggests hemolysis with elevated indirect bilirubin, LDH, reticulocyte count, and nucleated RBCs. However, there is no evidence of DIC, TTP, or microangiopathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has stable thrombocytopenia, which may require platelet transfusion to maintain a count of 40-50K.
5. Anemia: The patient's Hct is around 25% after transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBC) three days ago. Transfusion should be continued to maintain the Hct above 20%.
6. Diabetes mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated (generally high 200s). Long-acting and sliding-scale insulin"

   Ativan PRN. Differential: ICU delirium vs. prolonged anxiety/fatigue
   vs. respiratory distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis vs. cerebral
   vasculitis
   - c/w ativan PRN and Zydis standing
   - CT head to evaluate for cerebral involvement of vasculitis: Less
   likely, his AMS seems c/w pain & agitation
   - Wean steroids as possible
   - Serial EKGs to monitor QTc
   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury. Takes
   darvocet at home. D/c
d Fentanyl and started Methadone 5 mg PO
   yesterday. Also on Tylenol standing and Lidocaine patch. No tachy,
   moaning
   - Continue to monitor him on new regimen
   # Sigmoid Abscess: Less bloody drainage. Surgery following. On Vanc,
   Cefepime, Flagyl. Blood in drain possibly [**2-2**] recent manipulation.
   Fistula developing on recent imaging.
   - Start Cefepime, Flagyl per ID recs

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, presenting with hypotension, fever, and a drain for sigmoid abscess management. He has bilateral anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a dramatic increase in white count. The patient appears septic and is on vancomycin for empirical hospital-acquired pneumonia. He also has respiratory distress, agitation, pain, and altered mental status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating ongoing hypotension. This may require further intervention to maintain adequate blood flow and organ perfusion.
2. Fever: The patient's temperature is elevated, suggesting an ongoing infectious process or systemic inflammatory response. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and the source of infection should be identified.
3. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a known sigmoid abscess for which an internal drain has been placed. There is concern about the development of a fistula, and the patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover Gram-negative rods. Surgical consultation should be considered for further management.
4. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, and his oxygen saturation levels are below normal. Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be necessary to support respiratory function.
5. Agitation and Altered Mental Status: The patient is agitated, delirious, and non-verbal, requiring sedation and pain management"

   Assessment and Plan
   Tachycardia/HOTN/low grade fevers:  Consistent with ongoing sepsis.
   Will see if he can lie down for a CT in ICU.  Will get CT of
   head,chest, abdomen,pelvis.
   change meropenem to cefepime/flagyl as per ID.  RUQ U/S in the meantime
   Respiratory distress:  Will get repeat CXR, but doubt fluid overload as
   cause.  more likely aspiration/poor clearance of mucous due to poor MS.
   Agitation:  Slighly better controlled yesterday - he slept for 8 hours
   yesterday.
   Heme:  labs consistent with hemolysis - unclear cause.
   hyperglycemia:  increase glargine and SSI.
   sigmoid abscess:  draining feculent material, but too high risk for
   surgery currently.
   hypernatremia:  Increased free water boluses

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old man with pauci-immune vasculitis and a sigmoid abscess. The patient continues to experience delirium and has low blood pressure in the 90s/60s. He is febrile with a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit.

The patient has undergone several examinations and tests, including EKGs, an ultrasound to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and various lab results. The lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of creatinine, troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid. The patient's sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute, low-grade fevers, and low blood pressure ranging from 96/66 to 93/32 mmHg. His respiratory rate is 41 breaths per minute, and his oxygen saturation is 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with a face tent and has crackles in both lung fields.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace edema in both lower extremities and cool skin. Neurologically, he is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, and responds only to verbal stimuli. He opens his eyes to voice but movement and tone are not assessed."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, presenting with intermittent hypotension, fever, altered mental status, and a drain in place for sigmoid abscess management. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin for empiric hospital-acquired pneumonia, cefepime and flagyl for coverage of sigmoid abscess and gram-negative rods, and bactrim for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension, with a CVP of 2. The patient is panting and moaning, with no increased secretions. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and altered kidney function. The patient's pain is being managed with methadone, and agitation is being addressed with ativan PRN and zydis standing. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension and Fever: The patient's intermittent hypotension and fever could indicate sepsis or an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and continued administration of appropriate antibiotics are necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, anxiety, fatigue, respiratory distress, pain, steroid psychosis, or cerebral vasculitis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and symptomatic treatment such as ativan PRN and zydis"

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. He has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hypotension and Fever: The patient is hypotensive and febrile, indicating a possible ongoing infection or sepsis. The low central venous pressure (CVP) suggests poor perfusion.

2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is experiencing acute delirium, nonverbal, and calling out unintelligibly. This could be due to various reasons such as ICU delirium, prolonged anxiety/fatigue, respiratory distress, pain, steroid psychosis, or cerebral involvement of vasculitis.

3. Respiratory Status: The patient is panting and moaning, indicating respiratory distress. His chest X-ray is normal with no increased secretions. The decreased steroids and use of BiPAP suggest concerns about his respiratory status.

4. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a sigmoid abscess that is being managed with drainage and broad-spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Cefepime, and Flagyl. The blood in the drain may indicate recent manipulation or ongoing infection.

5. Chronic Pain: The patient has chronic back pain and a rotator cuff injury. His pain management regimen includes Methadone, Tylenol, and Lidocaine patch.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with various medical complications and conditions.

1. Respiratory status: The patient was intubated overnight due to tachypnea and increased work of breathing. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a peak end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for empirical pneumonia coverage. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is planned today to evaluate for possible pulmonary sources of infection, such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), Nocardia infection, or fungal infection. The use of bactrim will be held until the results are available.

2. Hypotension and fever: The patient's blood pressure has been within normal or low-normal limits over the past 24 hours. He has been afebrile for the past 24 hours. The current antibiotic regimen will continue, and a fluid bolus will be given if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is below 65. A pan culture will be done if the patient develops a fever again.

3. Agitation: Prior to intubation, the patient appeared intermittently agitated and uncomfortable despite receiving zydis. The cause"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress. He was placed on non-invasive ventilation but required invasive ventilation due to worsening condition. The patient has a history of allergies to specific medications and has received various antibiotics and infusions. His vital signs are stable with normal temperature, slightly low blood pressure, and an elevated heart rate. The patient's oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% on the ventilator. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a negative fluid balance. The patient is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding. His blood work indicates some abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests. The patient's condition remains critical, and he requires close monitoring and further treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Bloodstream infection: The presence of central venous catheters and arterial lines increases the risk of bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and decreased venous return due to mechanical ventilation can increase the risk of DVT.
4. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged immobility and pressure from the ventilator can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
5. Delirium: ICU stay and sedation medications can contribute to delirium in critically ill patients"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and intubated overnight. The patient has a drain in place for management of a sigmoid abscess. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode, PEEP 8, and FiO2 50%. The patient is receiving IV antibiotics (Vanc, Cefepime, Flagyl) for empiric coverage of pneumonia, and other medications such as Solumedrol, Propofol, and fentanyl for sedation and pain control. The plan includes bronchoscopy with BAL today to evaluate for possible pulmonary sources of infection, such as PCP. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is being started on long-acting insulin and sliding scale insulin. Other concerns include agitation, pain, hypotension, fever, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and restless leg syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, indicating respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in lung function, leading to increased difficulty in weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sigmoid Abscess: The presence of a drain for the sigmoid abscess suggests an ongoing infection in the abdomen. There is a risk of worsening infection or development of complications like fistula formation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient is receiving empiric antibiotic"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who was admitted with an irrigated drain placed for management of sigmoid abscess. He presented with shock, likely due to sepsis, and has been experiencing a dropping hematocrit level, guaiac positive stool coming out of the drain, relative hypotension with low central venous pressure (CVP), low urine output (UOP), and likely abdominal infection. The patient's respiratory status has also been a concern, with intubation overnight due to tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and discomfort. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and direct bilirubin. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and diabetes management. Several other medical conditions are being addressed, such as anemia, hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and liver disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Septic shock due to the ongoing abdominal infection and sepsis.
2. Acute kidney injury due to hypotension and low UOP.
3. Hemorrhagic complications due to thromboc"

   Assessment and Plan
   58M w/ pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, with IR-placed drain
   for management of sigmoid abscess
   # Shock: likely septic. Hct falling to 19 with guiaic positive stool
   coming out of drain. S/p
   Relatively hypotensive with low CVP, low UOP, likely abdominal
   infection. Likely needs surgical intervention.
   - transfuse 2 units PRBCs
   - surgery evaluation today ? to OR
   - bolusing with IVF as needed to maintain CVP > 10
   - track serial lactate
   - monitor UOP
   - Blood culture and urine cultures this morning
   - restart [**Last Name (un) 350**]
   - Continue vanco/flagyl
   # Sigmoid Abscess: Less bloody drainage. Surgery following. On Vanc,
   Cefepime, Flagyl. Brown drainiage from drain recently.  [**Month (only) 8**] be fecal in
   nature.  Fistula developing on recent imaging.
   - Continuing Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   # Goals of care
   # Respiratory status: Pt intubated over night in setting of tachypnea,
   increased work of breathing, discomfort.
   - Continuing Vanc/Cefepime Flagyl for empiric PNA coverage
   - BAL did not show too much hemorrhage
   - Reduce Solumedrol to 60 IV q8
   - f/u BAL for galactomannan, PCP stains, Nocardia cx and stains, fungal
   stains per ID recs
   - wait on IV bactrim until BAL results are back
   # Anemia: now acute, with guiaic positive stool as above, hct dropping
   to 19 overnight.
   - transfuse as above
   - monitor Hct Q6
   - cont to follow heme/onc recs
   # Heme: Confusing heme picture. Continues to have elevated direct
   bilirubin now, LDH, reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, picture c/w
   hemolysis and brisk marrow response. But haptoglobin initially not low,
   and pancytopenic generally. Heme/onc review of smear: No evidence of
   DIC, TTP or microangiopathy. Possible  effect of fluconazole
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs
   - Per heme/onc considering inpatient bone marrow biopsy
 possibly
   tonight, pending improved clinical stability
   - Attempting to limit bone marrow suppressive medications
   - f/u final SPEP, UPEP results
   - f/u G6PD level
   # DM: Getting long acting and sliding scale, increased two days ago;
   fingersticks 200
   - Increase sliding scale
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   - Start diabetic tube feeds and start checking fingersticks q4 hours
   - Can consider insulin gtt if pt still with persistently elevated
   glucose
   # Hypernatremia: Resolving. Given NPO status and bowel rest will stop
   flushes.
   - Stop free water flushes
   - f/u PM lytes
   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury.
    -Continuing Lidocaine patch
   - Holding delirium inducing medications
   # Agitation: Prior to intubation yesterday PM, Pt appeared
   intermittently agitated, appearing uncomfortable despite Zydis.
   Suspect: ICU delirium vs. prolonged anxiety/fatigue vs. respiratory
   distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis vs. cerebral vasculitis.
   rebound delirium. Pt currently well sedated on Propofol gtt
   - c/w Zydis [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue SSRI
   - Wean steroids as possible
   - propofol gtt and fentanyl gtt to allow for titration
   # Livedo reticularis: Noted on L hand and on legs at times, not active
   now.
   - Serial exams
   # CAD:  ECG during period of agitation: ST dep in high lateral leads,
   c/w strain pattern. Trops falling.
   - no further trending
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably low
   - Transfuse to maintain 40-50K
   # Restless leg:
   -DC ropinirole d/t sedating and hallucinatory side effects
   # BPH: Holding Flomax for now.
   # DVT w/ PE: Has IVC filter in place
   # Hypertension: Currently relatively hypotensive. Bolus as above.
   - will continue Sotalol for AF for now, if need to stop will consider
   # FEN: Dobhoff newly placed and functioning well
 may consider
   switching from Nutren Pulm to original tube feeds given hyperglycemia
   and hypovolemia
   # Lines: Multi Lumen RIJ, A-line, 20 gauge PIV
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - IVC filter,
   - increase PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   # Communication:  Patient, family
   # Code status: Full code for now
 will need further discussion
   # Disposition: ICU. PT consulted

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU with a drain placed for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications that require immediate attention.

1. Shock: The patient is likely septic and is showing signs of shock, including hypotension, low central venous pressure (CVP), and low urine output (UOP). This suggests that the patient may need surgical intervention.

2. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a sigmoid abscess with drainage through the abdominal drain site. Imaging studies show a fistula developing between the drain and the colon. The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole for empiric coverage of the infection.

3. Anemia: The patient is experiencing acute anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) dropping to 19 overnight. The guaiac positive stool indicates gastrointestinal bleeding as the cause of anemia.

4. Hemolysis: The patient has signs of hemolysis, including elevated direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte count, and nucleated red blood cells. However, the haptoglobin level is not low, suggesting that hemolysis may not be the primary cause of anemia.

5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin therapy"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient's current medical conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a drain in place for the abscess, and there is evidence of fecal drainage, indicating a possible fistula formation. The patient is currently on vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole.

2. Shock: The patient is likely septic, as indicated by the falling hematocrit (Hct) and positive guaiac test in the stool coming out of the drain. The patient has received a transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday, but the Hct is still low at 24.3. The patient will continue to receive intravenous fluids (IVF) to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) above 10 and will be monitored for serial lactate levels, urine output (UOP), and blood cultures.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1.5 today, indicating possible kidney injury. Renal dosing of medications will be done, and the patient's kidney function will be closely monitored.

   stains per ID recs
   - wait on IV bactrim until BAL results are back
   # Acute Kidney injury
   - Creatinine up to 1.5 today
   - renally dose all meds
   - Continue to trend closely
   - hold vanc pending next vanc level

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The note includes information about the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, imaging studies, and ongoing care.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 102 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 123/65 mmHg to 138/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The laboratory results indicate some abnormalities, including an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 34 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), and elevated lactate levels. Other lab results show a slightly low hemoglobin level (8.4 g/dL), low platelet count (46 K/uL), and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine (Cr) levels. The patient also has elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU. He has an IR-placed drain for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient has been experiencing increased bloody drainage from the drain, leading to transfusion of 2 units of PRBCs and platelets. The source of bleeding is unclear, with possible causes being diverticular bleed or vascular communication with the GI lumen.

The patient is also suspected to have septic shock, with a falling Hct and bloody stool coming out of the drain. No surgical intervention has been done at this time.

The patient's respiratory status remains intubated and failed pressure support trial. He will continue with current settings pending the development of concomitant acute issues.

The patient has acute kidney injury with creatinine at 1.5. Renal dose adjustment of medications will be done, and close monitoring is recommended.

The patient is also experiencing anemia with guaiac-positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Transfusion is ongoing, and Hct will be monitored q6h.

Further assessments and plans include monitoring UOP, tracking serial lactate, checking hospital lab values, continuing with current medications, and awaiting additional test results."

","Summary:
The patient is a middle-aged male admitted to the ICU with multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic anemia, and chronic kidney disease. The patient's current condition shows signs of respiratory failure due to impaired ventilation and gas exchange. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. His vital signs indicate hypotension with a blood pressure of 134/62 mmHg, tachycardia with a heart rate of 89 bpm, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.6 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 36 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L. The patient's glucose level is 119 mg/dL, and his lactate level is elevated at 1.2 mmol/L.

The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals a pH of 7.27, pCO2 of 41, pO2 of 72, HCO3 of 20, and base excess of -"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pauci-immune vasculitis who was admitted with pulmonary hemorrhage. The patient experienced a gastrointestinal bleed and received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 2 units of platelets throughout the day. The patient has been on multiple medications including vancomycin, metronidazole, meropenem, fentanyl, dextrose, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but they have shown intermittent hypotension. The patient's blood cultures and urine cultures have been sent. The patient's respiratory status remains intubated, and they failed a pressure support trial. The patient's kidney function is compromised with a creatinine level of 1.5. The patient also has anemia and signs of hemolysis with elevated direct bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, and a negative haptoglobin. The patient's pain management and agitation are also being addressed. There are several other medical issues and complications that need to be monitored and managed, such as livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, hypertension, and goals of care.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Continued gastrointestinal bleeding:"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of a sigmoid abscess. The patient has had several medical complications during his stay, including hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, anemia, and possible hemolysis. The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. His blood sugar levels have been unstable, requiring adjustments to the sliding scale insulin. The patient's hemoglobin and platelet counts have been low, necessitating transfusions. He also has hypernatremia and various other issues such as pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, restless leg syndrome, and a history of deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a known sigmoid abscess, which requires ongoing management. There is a risk of surgical intervention if the abscess does not improve with conservative measures.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, as indicated by intermittently falling hematocrit and hypotension. Close monitoring of fluid balance and blood cultures is necessary.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Pressure support trials have been attempted, but so far unsuccessful. Weaning off sedation and attempting another pressure support trial may be considered.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.0, indicating acute kidney injury. Renal dosing of medications, close monitoring, and consideration of gentle diuresis if creatinine improves are recommended.
5. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia with guaiac-positive stool, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Transfusion and monitoring of hematocrit are necessary.
6. Hemolysis: The patient's laboratory results suggest hemolysis, with elevated direct bilirubin, LDH, reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, and polyclonal IgG without spikes. Further evaluation by hematology/oncology is needed.
7. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved, but close follow-up is required.
8. Pain and Agitation: The patient continues to experience pain and agitation, which may be due to various causes such as ICU delirium, prolonged anxiety/fatigue, respiratory distress, pain, steroid psychosis, or cerebral vasculitis. Sedation and analgesia should be tailored to the patient's needs.
9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, necessitating platelet transfusion to maintain platelet count above 50K.
10. Deep Vein Thrombosis with Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has a history of DVT/PE and has an IVC filter in place.

The Answer is: These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression.
- He has a sigmoid abscess for which an interventional radiology (IR)-placed drain was inserted.
- The patient's current issues include shock, likely septic, with intermittent falling Hct but maintaining BP.
- He also has respiratory status problems, intubated and failed pressure support trial.
- Other concerns include acute kidney injury, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hemolysis, skin breakdown, hypernatremia, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension.
- The patient's goals of care include continuing to update the family on his status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid abscess:
   - The patient has a drain in place for the management of a sigmoid abscess.
   - There is a risk of ongoing bleeding or infection at the abscess site.
   - Surgical intervention may be required if the abscess does not improve with conservative management.

2. Septic shock:
   - The patient's condition indicates signs of sepsis, which can lead to septic shock.
   - Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
   - The patient's vital signs should be closely monitored, and appropriate antibiotics and fluids should"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuations in hemoglobin levels, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of hemolysis. The patient has also shown signs of septic shock, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, and anemia. Several medications have been adjusted or discontinued based on the patient's response and lab results. The patient's current goals of care include maintaining hemodynamic stability, managing blood sugar levels, addressing thrombocytopenia, and evaluating the cause of anemia. The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient's sigmoid abscess needs to be managed appropriately to prevent further complications such as infection or perforation.
2. Septic Shock: The patient's likely septic shock needs to be closely monitored and treated promptly to prevent multiorgan failure and death.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient remains intubated and has failed pressure support trials. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management, including fluid balance and medication adjustments, are crucial.
5. Anemia:"

The patient has a drain in place for management of a sigmoid abscess and is receiving treatment with Vancomycin and Metronidazole. The patient's condition has been unstable, with intermittent hypotension and falling hematocrit levels. There have been concerns about bleeding, including a possible diverticular bleed or vascular communication with the GI lumen. The patient has received 2 units of platelets and red blood cells. The patient's respiratory status remains intubated and they have failed a pressure support trial. There are concerns about sepsis, acute kidney injury, anemia, and hemolysis. The patient's electrolytes and liver function tests are abnormal, and there are indications of possible G6PD deficiency. The patient has hypernatremia, chronic pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The patient's goals of care include continuing to update the family on his status. The patient's current code status is full code, and he will need further discussion. The patient's disposition is to remain in the ICU.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of sigmoid abscess. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

- Sigmoid Abscess: The patient's Hct is stable, and there is no surgical intervention planned at this time. A negative RBC scan indicates no active bleeding.
- Shock: The patient is likely septic with intermittent falling Hct but maintaining BP. Surgery has declined surgical intervention, and the PCP test was negative. The patient is being bolused as needed to maintain CVP > 10, currently on D5 for sugar. The goal is to maintain Hct > 20 and platelets > 50.
- Respiratory status: The patient remains intubated and failed a pressure support trial. Another pressure support trial will be attempted today with decreased sedation. Current settings will be left unchanged pending the development of concomitant acute issues (bleeding, renal failure).
- Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is 2.0. Renally dose all medications, continue to trend closely, and follow-up creatinine this PM on lasix drip.
- DM (Diabetes Mellitus): The patient is unable to sustain blood sugars off tube feeds. Stop long-acting insulin, D5W until able to maintain sugars, and change to D10 if surgery does not want to resume tube feeds.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. 

Over the past day, the patient's fluid balance has been significantly up, so the lasix drip was started. However, this led to an increase in creatinine levels, indicating possible renal toxicity. Therefore, the lasix drip was shut off. The patient also experienced hypoglycemia while off tube feeds, requiring the addition of D5. 

The patient has ongoing respiratory issues, including intubation and failure of pressure support trial. The patient remains on AC ventilation and will continue to be monitored closely. 

Other issues include anemia, hypernatremia (resolved), hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is also experiencing skin breakdown, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. 

The patient's current medications include midazolam, furosemide, fentanyl, pantoprazole, dextrose, and others. 

The patient's recent lab results show elevated creatinine, low potassium, low calcium, and elevated lactate levels.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

The patient has been receiving lasix drip to promote diuresis, but this has resulted in an increase in fluid output and the goal of a few liters was not achieved. The lasix drip was subsequently stopped due to concerns about renal toxicity and ototoxicity.

The patient experienced hypoglycemia on Saturday night and was started on D5 to D10, with current blood sugars ranging from 100s to 200s. The D10 has been stopped, and the patient is now on 170s.

The patient also has calcium levels that are low, and he has received calcium gluconate to address this issue.

Other medications include midazolam (Versed), furosemide (Lasix), fentanyl, pantoprazole (Protonix), and dextrose 50%. These medications are being titrated as needed based on the patient's condition.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/63 to 151/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%.

The patient's blood work shows a white blood"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to shock, likely septic, and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's current conditions include acute kidney injury, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hemolysis with brisk marrow response, hypernatremia resolved, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is currently experiencing dark stool drainage from a drain in the abdomen. Close monitoring of vital signs, hemodynamic status, and laboratory parameters is necessary to assess for ongoing blood loss and guide appropriate interventions.

2. Acute kidney injury: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and adjustment of medications accordingly are essential to prevent further deterioration of kidney function.

3. Infection: The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, suggesting an ongoing infection. Continued surveillance for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or positive cultures, is crucial to guide antimicrobial therapy and prevent complications like sepsis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with pulmonary vasculitis on immunosuppression, who has been admitted to the ICU for management of sigmoid abscess. He is intubated and remains in the ICU due to various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, as indicated by intermittently falling hematocrit levels and maintaining blood pressure. He requires close monitoring and fluid resuscitation to maintain CVP > 10.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level is elevated at 2.0, indicating possible acute kidney injury. Renal dose adjustments for medications are necessary, and close monitoring of creatinine levels is required.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient remains intubated and has failed pressure support trials. Another trial of pressure support will be attempted today with decreased sedation. Current ventilator settings will be maintained pending the development of concomitant acute issues.
4. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia with a positive guaiac stool test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Transfusion of blood products is needed to maintain Hct > 23 and Platelets > 50.
5. Hemolysis: The patient's laboratory results show signs of hemolysis, including elevated direct bilirubin, LDH, reticulocyte count, and nucleated RBCs. Further evaluation by hematology/oncology is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute kidney injury. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a positive guaiac stool indicating ongoing bleeding, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient's medical conditions include shock (likely septic), anemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, acute kidney injury, hemolysis, and skin breakdown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and continues to have positive guaiac stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. This can lead to hypotension, shock, and further deterioration of kidney function.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to recurrent respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further lung complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has a rising creatinine level, indicating worsening AKI. This can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

   - Blood culture and urine cultures this morning. No new cx data
   - Continue flagyl, d/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] (off vanc).
   # Respiratory status: Remains intubated, failed pressure support trial.
   Will try pressure support trial again today with decreased sedation.
   continue current settings pending the development of concomitant acute
   issues (bleeding, renal failure).  PCP was negative, therefore IV
   bactrim not started. Volume status has been climbing up steadily over
   last several weeks.
   - leave on AC ventilation
   - reducing antibiotics as above
   - continue Solumedrol at 60 IV q8 pending discussion with pulm
   - volume management: 10mg IV lasix bolus with low-dose lasix drip at
   4mg/hr; keep on low dose due to renal failure. Will f/u creatinine on
   this drip and make adjustments accordingly.
   - Check PM lytes
   - f/u BAL for galactomannan, Nocardia cx and stains, fungal stains per
   ID recs
   - check triglycerides and switch to midaz if elevated
   # Acute Kidney injury
 creatinine is 2.0
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue to trend closely
   - F/u creatinine this PM on lasix drip.
   - Off Vanco, will d/c other antibiotics today
   # DM: pt unable to sustain blood sugars off tube feeds
   - stop long acting insulin

   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury.
    Continuing Lidocaine patch
   - Holding delirium inducing medications
   # Agitation: Pt had appeared intermittently agitated, appearing
   uncomfortable despite Zydis. Suspect: ICU delirium vs. prolonged
   anxiety/fatigue vs. respiratory distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis
   vs. cerebral vasculitis v. rebound delirium. Pt currently well sedated
   on Propofol gtt. Well-sedated now.
   - c/w Zydis [**Hospital1 **]

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He presented with acute kidney injury, hypoglycemia, anemia, shock, respiratory failure, and potential liver involvement. The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, back pain, rotator cuff injury, skin breakdown, hypernatremia, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, thrombocytopenia, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. LGIB/Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding with a stable hematocrit level. The plan is to continue monitoring and transfusing as needed. If the bleeding continues, further evaluation for upper gastrointestinal bleeding may be necessary.
2. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, which has responded to fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and lactate levels is recommended. Surgical intervention has been ruled out at this time.
3. Respiratory Status: The patient remains intubated and failed a pressure support trial. Another attempt at pressure support trial will be made today with decreased sedation. Current ventilation settings will be maintained pending the development of concomitant acute issues.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine level"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, with a heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 121/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient was started on lasix, which led to an increase in urine output. However, the patient experienced hypoglycemia and required dextrose infusion. Calcium levels were also found to be low and were supplemented. The patient is currently on multiple medications including midazolam, furosemide, and pantoprazole. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission.

   D5.
   # Respiratory status: Remains intubated, failed pressure support trial.
   Will try pressure support trial again today with decreased sedation.
   continue current settings pending the development of concomitant acute
   issues (bleeding, renal failure).  PCP was negative, therefore IV
   bactrim not started. Volume status has been climbing up steadily over
   last several weeks.
   - leave on AC ventilation
   - try to decrease sedation to get to self-breathe
   - volume overloaded, but lasix d/c
ed yesterday due to non-benefit.
   - continue Solumedrol at 250 IV q6h x 3 days, then will drop by 50mg
   per dose to get to 50-100 q8.
   - Check PM lytes
   - f/u BAL for galactomannan, Nocardia cx and stains, fungal stains per

   sugars have been very high) in addition to pre-renal failure/
   long-standing poor hemodynamics.
   - Checking serum ketones to determine any component of ketoacidosis.
   - Check UA for ketones
   - continue to trend creatinine closely
   - Will discuss with renal long-term HD for management of renal and
   volume status (along with tracheostomy and PEG).
   # DM: sugars high (200s) most recently. Tube feeds held overnight
   because absent bowel sounds; high blood sugars in setting of increased
   steroid dose.
   - Starting insulin drip due to steroid dose increase and high steroid
   dose
   - Gingerly advancing tube feeds although bowel sounds continue to be
   hypoactive
   - Check serum ketones to evaluate for ketoacidosis
   - q4 FS and ISS
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Anemia: now acute, with guiaic positive stool as above with more
   frank bloody appearing stool this morning

   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury.
    Continuing Lidocaine patch
   - Holding delirium inducing medications
   # Agitation: Pt had appeared intermittently agitated, appearing
   uncomfortable despite Zydis. Suspect: ICU delirium vs. prolonged
   anxiety/fatigue vs. respiratory distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis
   vs. cerebral vasculitis v. rebound delirium. Pt currently well sedated
   on Propofol gtt. Well-sedated now.
   - c/w Zydis [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue SSRI

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, including acute kidney injury, hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and possible delirium.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a failure of pressure support trial, so the current settings will be continued. The patient will be tried again on pressure support trial with decreased sedation.

2. Sigmoid Abscess: The patient has a sigmoid abscess with ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating significant blood loss. Blood transfusion and platelet transfusion may be necessary to maintain adequate hemoglobin and platelet levels.

3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may be due to pre-renal failure or ketoacidosis. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugars, likely due to increased steroid dose. An insulin drip has been started to manage blood sugar levels.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count"

   lasix gtt.
   - renally dose all meds
   - continue to trend closely
   - F/u creatinine this PM on lasix drip.
   - Off Vanco, will d/c other antibiotics today
   - If steroids do not have good effect, discuss long-term HD for
   management of renal and volume status (along with tracheostomy and
   PEG).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient has remained on ventilator support and has failed pressure-controlled ventilation with spontaneous breathing. The PEEP has been increased to 14 cmH2O. Blood sugars have been rising, leading to the initiation of insulin via a continuous glucose infusion. There is uncertainty regarding subcutaneous absorption and the administration of high-dose steroids. A Coombs test has been requested by the hematology department. The patient's acidosis has slightly worsened, as indicated by an increased pCO2 level of 46 on the 2 am ABG.

The patient's allergies are unknown, and the last doses of antibiotics were given on 12/3/2112 at 08:00 AM (meropenem) and 05:33 PM (metronidazole). The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusion at 125 mcg/hour and other ICU medications including pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:00 PM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for some noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/61 mmHg to 150/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,247 mL, including 234 mL of IV fluids, and a total output of 1,460 mL, including 490 mL of blood products. Urine output is at 1,400 mL, and NG output is at 60 mL. Stool output is 300 mL, and drain output is 60 mL. The respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with PRVC/AC ventilation mode, set Vt of 600 mL, RR set at 22 breaths per minute, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 60%, and RSBI deferred due to PEEP > 10. ABG results show a pH of 7.19, pCO2 of 46, HCO3- of 17 mEq/L, BE of -10, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 177, and Ve of 13.2 L/min.

Physical examination findings include leukocytosis with a WBC count of 39 K/uL, anemia with a Hct of 27.9%, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 45, elevated liver enzymes with ALT/AST levels of 164/160, and elevated lactate level of 1.4 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 85 to 186 mg/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 2.0 to 2.6 mg/dL, and elevated tropon"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and acute kidney injury. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and hemolysis. He also has skin breakdown, hypernatremia, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, and hypertension. The patient's goals of care include continuing to update the family on his status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's current respiratory status is unstable, and he remains intubated. There is a potential risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.

2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently experiencing anemia and hemolysis. There is a potential risk of ongoing bleeding or recurrence of GIB.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has an increasing creatinine level, indicating worsening renal function. AKI can lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient in the ICU. These include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and on pressure support ventilation. There is a need to continue monitoring the respiratory status and adjusting the ventilator settings as necessary.

2. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient has ongoing bloody stool and positive guaiac test, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and blood counts is required. Transfusion of RBCs and platelets may be necessary. Further evaluation of the source of bleeding, such as an endoscopy, may be needed.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are rising, indicating a decline in kidney function. The cause of AKI could be pre-renal failure due to hypovolemia, intrinsic renal damage, or post-renal obstruction. Further evaluation and management are required.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelet transfusion may be necessary if the platelet count drops below a certain threshold or if there are signs of bleeding.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has high blood sugars, indicating poorly controlled diabetes. Insulin therapy may be required to manage the blood glucose levels.

6. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Blood transfusion"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and anemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been experiencing hypotension, hyperglycemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, and skin breakdown.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating worsening renal function. His blood sugar levels are consistently high, and he has been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient's platelet count is low, and he has been transfused with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelets. His coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with a normal international normalized ratio (INR).

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes mellitus. He has a history of recurrent admissions to the ICU for respiratory failure and sepsis.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicates ongoing respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration in lung function.

2. Acute"

- The patient was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s and 80s around 8 pm. Acidosis, rising potassium, and creatinine levels were also noted.
- The patient was given 2L boluses of D5W with 150 Bicarb, then 1L of maintenance fluids. Vent settings were changed from pressure support to assist control due to ""guppy"" like breathing.
- The patient's son was updated, and it was discussed that the patient should be DNR/DNI, with no chest compressions or shocks in the event of decompensation overnight. The son plans to come in tomorrow to discuss goals of care.
- The patient started on insulin gtt and broadly covered with antibiotics.
- The patient's respiratory status improved around 12 AM.
- The patient has a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and has undergone a recent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure of 118/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient was noted to be hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s-80s around 8pm.
- The patient's acidosis worsened, with rising potassium and creatinine levels.
- 2L boluses of D5W with 150 bicarb were given, followed by 1L of maintenance fluids.
- Vent settings were changed from pressure support to assist control due to the patient's ""guppy"" like breathing.
- The patient's son was updated on the patient's condition, and it was discussed that the patient should be DNR/DNI, with no chest compressions or shocks if the patient decompensates overnight.
- The patient started on insulin gtt and was broadly covered with antibiotics (meropenem, metronidazole, vancomycin).
- By 12 AM, the patient's BP and respiratory status improved.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates potential hypotension, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and tissue hypoxia.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The rising creatinine levels suggest renal dysfunction, potentially due to hypoperfusion or other underlying conditions such as sepsis or nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Acidosis: The worsening acidosis indicates an imbalance in acid-base regulation, which may be caused by respiratory or metabolic issues, potentially leading to further organ dysfunction.
4. Hyperkalemia: The elevated potassium levels can increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's altered respiratory pattern and impaired gas exchange suggest respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed promptly.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.
7. Infection: The broad coverage with antibiotics suggests a concern for infection, possibly indicating sepsis or an ongoing infection.
8. Diabetic Complications: The presence of diabetes mellitus type II and elevated glucose levels may contribute to further complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
9. Chronic Anemia: The patient's history of chronic anemia may impact oxygen delivery to tissues.
10. Ischemic Heart Disease: The history of coronary artery disease increases the risk of cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction.

Please note that this summary and list of potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate management."

   control. Antibiotics started in setting of decompensation overnight.
   - leave on AC ventilation, Pt unable to tolerate pressure support
   - tried yesterday to decrease sedation to get to self-breathe, Pt w/
   agonal type breathing
   - continue Solumedrol taper to 200/150/100 today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Flagyl started overnight setting of
   - f/u BAL for galactomannan, Nocardia cx and stains, fungal stains,
   still no new culture data
   - Bactrim held for concern of bone marrow suppression
   .
   # LGIB/Sigmoid Abscess:  Hct stable this AM. No surgical intervention
   at this time. Negative RBC scan. Restarted tube feeds after discussion
   with surgery
   - Hct QD
   - Continue tube feeds
   - Off antibiotics
   - if appears to be bleeding transfuse RBC and PLT as needed. Goal Hct >
   23, Platelets > 50
   - If continued bleeding, contact GI re: evaluating for UGIB
   - Appreciate IR and Surgery
s continued following of patient
   # Acute Kidney injury
 creatinine increasing (3.1 this AM) s/p lasix
   drip, but will consider other etiologies such as ketoacidosis (blood
   sugars have been very high) in addition to pre-renal failure/
   long-standing poor hemodynamics.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and anemia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been experiencing hypotension, increased acidosis, rising potassium and creatinine levels, hypoglycemia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and hemolysis. He is on mechanical ventilation, sedated, and intubated. The patient's family has agreed to make him DNR/DNI in the event of decompensation. They do not want any tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), or hemodialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate a decline in kidney function, which could be due to pre-renal failure, long-standing poor hemodynamics, or ketoacidosis.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient has a history of GIB, and there is ongoing bleeding as evidenced by the presence of maroon stool and positive guaiac test.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. Platelets and DDAVP have been ordered to be administered if there is any bleeding.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA):"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient's TF (likely referring to tube feeding) could not be restarted due to a clogged Dobhoff tube, and attempts to declog it were unsuccessful.
- The patient experienced hypotension with blood pressures in the 80s/40s and was febrile.
- The patient produced 2 liters of urine and had urine output of around 20 per hour.
- A family meeting was held, and it was decided to make the patient DNR (do not resuscitate).
- Lantus insulin was restarted at a dose of 30 units, and aluminum oxide was started to lower phosphate levels.
- The patient's calcium level was low at 6, and calcium gluconate was administered.
- New wound care recommendations were provided.
- The patient has no known drug allergies.
- Infusions and other medications are documented but not specified in detail.
- The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events.
- Flow sheet data includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.
- The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F) with a maximum temperature of 35.8°C (96.5°F), heart rate of 82 bpm with a range of 77-93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 79-118/44-66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute"

   Assessment and Plan
   58M pauci-immune pulm vasculitis c/b hemorrhage despite aggressive
   immunosupression, colonic abscess, recurrent resp failure, GIB - recent
   HCT stable, rising creatinine. Steroid pulse initiated, on insulin gtt,
   massively volume overloaded with rising creatinine. Back on VAC,
   hypotensive, progressive ARF / acidosis.
   # Goals of care
   - continue to update family on his status
   - Family to visit today to discuss goals of care. Family notified last
   night when Pt was decompensating and agreed to make DNR/DNI
   - Per previous conversations, Pt
s family does not want trach/PEG/HD
   - will discuss CMO option as well
   # Recalcitrant Hypocalcemia:
    - continue aluminum hydroxide to lower phosphate
   # Respiratory status: Pt failed pressure support trial, back on assist
   control. Antibiotics started in setting of decompensation overnight.
   - leave on AC ventilation, Pt unable to tolerate pressure support
   - tried yesterday to decrease sedation to get to self-breathe, Pt w/
   agonal type breathing
   - continue Solumedrol taper to 200/150/100 today
   - Check PM lytes
   - Vanc/[**Last Name (un) 350**]/Flagyl started overnight setting of
   - f/u BAL for galactomannan, Nocardia cx and stains, fungal stains,
   still no new culture data
   - Bactrim held for concern of bone marrow suppression
   # Acute Kidney injury
 creatinine increasing (3.1 this AM) s/p lasix
   drip, but will consider other etiologies such as ketoacidosis (blood
   sugars have been very high) in addition to pre-renal failure/
   long-standing poor hemodynamics.
   - continue to trend creatinine closely
   - Long term HD discussed yesterday with family
 they will likely not
   choose this route, but will follow up.
   - start Aluminum OH today to lower phosphate; currently unable to
   adequately replete ionized calcium
   # LGIB/Sigmoid Abscess:  Hct stable this AM. No surgical intervention
   at this time. Negative RBC scan. Restarted tube feeds after discussion
   with surgery.
   - Hct QD
   - Continue tube feeds
   - Continue broad antibiotics until family discussion with concern for
   HAP
   - if appears to be bleeding transfuse RBC and PLT as needed. Goal Hct >
   23, Platelets > 50
   - If continued bleeding, contact GI re: evaluating for UGIB
   - Appreciate Surgery
s long-standing input, now signing off
   # Thrombocytopenia
   - Platelets today 25 from 27 yesterday
   - Pt. is not currently bleeding
 will plan to give platelets and DDAVP
   only if bleeding of PLT < 15
   - Transfuse FFP for signs of bleeding or Platelets less than <15
   # DM: sugars high (200s) most recently. Tube feeds held overnight
   because absent bowel sounds; high blood sugars in setting of increased
   steroid dose.  Insulin drip restarted last night in setting of steroids
   and D5.
   - Hold TF for residual
 will consider insulin drip to avoid
   hypoglycemia
   - q4 FS and ISS
   - continue lantus (started 10 units QHS yesterday)
   - Follow-up [**Last Name (un) 72**] recs
   # Anemia: now acute, with guiaic positive stool as above with more
   frank bloody appearing stool last week which has now improved
   - transfuse as above
   - monitor Hct
   - cont to follow heme/onc recs; will not biopsy for now.
   # Heme: Confusing heme picture. Continues to have elevated direct
   bilirubin now, LDH, reticulocyte count, nucleated RBCs, picture c/w
   hemolysis and brisk marrow response. But haptoglobin initially not low,
   and pancytopenic generally. Heme/onc review of smear: No evidence of
   DIC, TTP or microangiopathy. Possible  effect of fluconazole. SPEP and
   UPEP results
 polyclonal IgG without spikes, likely [**2-2**] recent IVIG.
   G6PD level WNL.
   - Appreciate Heme/Onc recs, now signing off
   - Per heme/onc considering inpatient bone marrow biopsy put on hold for
   now given clinical condition
   - Attempting to limit bone marrow suppressive medications
   #) Skin breakdown
   - Continue to follow wound care recommendations
   # Electrolyte Abnormalities:  Pt. had hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia over
   night.
   - replete lytes as needed
   - kayexelate PR
   - calcium acetate
   - lytes q6-8 hours
   # Pain: Has chronic pain in back, and from rotator cuff injury.
    Continuing Lidocaine patch
   - Holding delirium inducing medications, will attempt to give fentanyl,
   transition down on sedation
   # Agitation: Pt had appeared intermittently agitated, appearing
   uncomfortable despite Zydis. Suspect: ICU delirium vs. prolonged
   anxiety/fatigue vs. respiratory distress vs. pain vs. steroid psychosis
   vs. cerebral vasculitis v. rebound delirium. Pt currently well sedated
   on Propofol gtt. Well-sedated now.
   - c/w Zydis [**Hospital1 **]
   - Continue SSRI
   - Wean steroids as possible
   - cont propofol gtt and fentanyl gtt to allow for titration
   - check TG and consider midaz as above
   # Livedo reticularis: Noted on L hand and on legs at times, not active
   now.
   - Serial exams
   # CAD:  ECG during period of agitation: ST dep in high lateral leads,
   c/w strain pattern. Trops falling.
   - no further trending
   # Thrombocytopenia: falling
   - Transfuse to maintain PLT > 50K
   # Restless leg:
   -DC ropinirole d/t sedating and hallucinatory side effects
   # BPH: Holding Flomax for now.
   # DVT w/ PE: Has IVC filter in place
   # Hypertension: Currently relatively hypotensive. Bolus as above.
   -  Sotalol held due to increased Qtc; will resume QD sotalol dose
   today.
   # FEN: resume tube feeds today with surgery, f/u with nutrition.
   - Replete lytes as necessary
   - K is somewhat high, check PM lytes K

   Multi Lumen RIJ
 consider removing (placed ~2 weeks ago) and placing
   PICC, however will hold on this today d/t bleeding
   A-line
   20 gauge PIV
   # Prophylaxis:
   - Pneumoboots
   - IVC filter
   - continue PPI to [**Hospital1 **]
   # Communication: Patient, family (son = [**Male First Name (un) 11352**]
 continue to call
   family daily
   - Family meeting today
   # Code status: DNR per discussion with son last night but will discuss
   with son later today.

   Agree with plan to manage ongoing hypoxemic respiratory failure with
   steroid taper back to SM 60mg q8h, VAC support, abx for possible
   pneumonia. Progressive acidosis / ARF - RD meds, optimize hemodynamics,
   med rx of hyperkalemia including kayexalate PR, HCO3 and AlOH for
   hyperphosphatemia. LGIB / blood loss anemia has improved with serial
   transfusion, HCT QD; will retry TFs today, methylnaltrexone PRN. DM2
   - insulin gtt for now in the setting of D5 / steroids. Sotalol for AF -
   change to QD, not a candidate for anticoagulation. PPI, pnbts, filter,

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of pauci-immune pulmonary vasculitis, colonic abscess, recurrent respiratory failure, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hemolysis, electrolyte abnormalities, pain, agitation, livedo reticularis, coronary artery disease, restless leg syndrome, benign prostatic hyperplasia, deep vein thrombosis with pulmonary embolism, hypertension, and fenestrated endograft placement.

The patient's recent events include the inability to restart tube feeds due to clogged Dobhoff tube, febrile state with blood pressures running in the 80s/40s, positive fluid balance with urine output of 20 per hour, family meeting to discuss do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and potential de-escalation of current care regimen, restart of Lantus at 30 units, initiation of aluminum hydroxide to lower phosphate levels, new wound care recommendations, and administration of antibiotics for suspected infection.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 82 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 99/66 to 118/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator support, and sinus rhythm with a central venous pressure of 2 mm"
