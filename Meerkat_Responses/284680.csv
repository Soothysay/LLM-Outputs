   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 10055**] is an 82 yo [**Country **] Rican F w/ asthma and bronchiectasis
   admitted w/ dry non-productive cough, myalgias, and SOB x 1 wk.
   Symptoms most c/w viral process and exacerbation of underlying asthma.
   .
   #. Influenza like symptoms - No evidence of bacterial PNA on CXR. Her
   symptoms are c/w flu or other viral process. However, she is known to
   be colonized with both psuedomonas and E Coli (see bronchiectasis
   below).
   -- follow up flu swab
   -- begin tamiflu treatment dose for now, d/c if swab negative
   -- supportive care with tylenol, IVF, nebulizers, guaifenosin-dextro
   and tessalon perles
   -- f/u blood cultures
   -- send induced sputum culture for routine and PCP (chronic steroids)
   -- will begin ceftazidime for now (E Coli and pseudomonas were both S),
   but if cultures negative in 48 hours, will d/c.
   .
   # Asthma/Bronchiectasis - Never intubated in the past for her asthma.
   With regards to bronchiectasis, pt has grown pseudomonas (pan S) and E
   coli (quinolone resistent) from sputum in the recent past. Per Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) 104**], should her cough/dyspnea worsen, he would support an empiric
   course of antibiotics with effectiveness against her known colonizers.
   -- continue IV steroid burst with 125mg IV q6h solumedrol
   -- continue inhaled budesonide ([**Hospital1 5**] equiv = fluticasone) for now but
   likely of little benefit given systmeic steroid burst
   -- standing q4h albuterol nebs with q2h prn breakthrough
   -- supplemental O2 to maintain O2 sats >92%
   -- consider magnesium if no improvement
   -- will give ceftaz for now as above, d/c in 48 hours if no growht on
   cultures
   -- given increased steroid dosing, will check FSGs qid and write for
   ISS
   .
   #. Leukocytosis - Has baseline elevation due to chronic steroid use,
   however presence of left shift and bands more suggestive of infection.
   -- pan culture and empiric antibiotics as above, with plan to d/c if no
   growth
   -- trend WBC count
   .
   #. Anemia - borderline microcytic. HCT 31.5 on admission, appears to be
   close to baseline, but was 38.9 last month on routine outpatient check.
   Previously found to be iron deficient on admission [**8-10**].
   -- FeSo4 supplements
   -- guaiac all stools
   -- needs outpatient colonoscopy
   .
   #. Chondrocalcinosis - on 10mg prednisone daily at home.
   -- getting IV steroid burst, will need taper back to 10mg prednisone
   upon d/c
   .
   # Osteoporosis - also on chronic steroids
   -- continue calcium, vitamin D, weekly alendronate
   .
   #. Chronic Kidney Injury - Cr stable at 1.2
   -- renally dose all medications
   -- trend Creatinine
   .
   # HTN
   -- hold diltiazem in setting of dehydration and acute infection

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms consistent with a viral process and an exacerbation of underlying asthma. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure of 130/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include tachycardia, scattered rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds, and early inspiratory crackles with prolonged expiratory phase. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, glucose level, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1). The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including influenza-like symptoms, asthma/bronchiectasis, leukocytosis, anemia, chondrocalcinosis, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney injury. She is currently receiving various medications and treatments, including antiviral therapy, antibiotics, steroids, bronchodilators, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of asthma and bronchiectasis, there is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms, such as pneumonia or exacerbation of bronchiectasis.
2. Influenza-like Symptoms: The patient's presentation is consistent with influenza, but since she is known to be colonized with both Pseudomonas and E"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory infection, exacerbation of underlying asthma, and dry non-productive cough. The patient tested positive for influenza but no bacterial pneumonia was found on chest X-ray. Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 116 bpm, blood pressure within normal range, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals occasional dry cough, scattered rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds, and early inspiratory crackles with prolonged expiratory phase. The patient's labs indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 309 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 151 mg/dL, and borderline microcytic anemia with a Hct of 31.3%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Influenza infection: The patient tested positive for influenza, which can lead to respiratory symptoms and complications such as pneumonia. Monitoring for worsening respiratory symptoms and ensuring appropriate antiviral treatment is ongoing.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's underlying asthma seems to be exacerbated by the viral infection. Close monitoring of respiratory status and administration of appropriate bronchodilators and corticosteroids are necessary to manage the asthma symptoms effectively.
3. Pseudomonas infection: The patient has a history of growing"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

Ms. [Known Lastname 10055], an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis, was admitted with dry non-productive cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week due to influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma. She tested positive for influenza but had no evidence of bacterial pneumonia on chest X-ray.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/74 mmHg to 150/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She exhibits sinus tachycardia on electrocardiogram.

The patient has received Tamiflu for influenza and supportive care with intravenous fluids, nebulizers, guaifenesin-dextromethorphan, and Tessalon pearls. Acetaminophen is being held to monitor for fever. Blood cultures have been obtained.

Regarding her underlying conditions, the patient has asthma and bronchiectasis. She has never been intubated for her asthma in the past. She has a history of growing pseudomonas and E. coli (quinolone resistant) from sputum in the recent past. If her cough or dyspnea worsens, an empirical course of antibiotics effective against her known colonizers will be considered.

The patient's labs show leukocytosis, likely due to steroid use, with a white blood cell count of 13.3 K/uL. Other lab results include a hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, and glucose of 151 mg/dL. Calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels are within normal range.

The patient has a history of anemia, with a hematocrit of 31.5 on admission. She is iron deficient and will be started on iron sulfate supplements. A guaiac test of all stools will be performed, and she needs an outpatient colonoscopy.

She also has chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. She is currently on 10 mg of prednisone daily at home and will receive an IV steroid burst before discharge.

The patient's chronic kidney injury is stable with a creatinine level of 1.2. Medications will be renally dosed, and creatinine levels will be trended.

Her hypertension is being managed with restarted diltiazem for rate and blood pressure control.

In the ICU, the patient is receiving regular diet, glycemic control with RISS (routine insulin sliding scale), and prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin for DVT, home proton pump inhibitor for stress ulcer, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) precautions. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate), and she will continue to be monitored closely."

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known lastname 10055**] is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms of dry non-productive cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week due to influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma. Her laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, chondrocalcinosis, osteoporosis, and chronic kidney injury. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments for her conditions, including antivirals, steroids, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Influenza infection: As the patient has tested positive for influenza, there is a risk of worsening respiratory symptoms and potential complications such as pneumonia.
2. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's underlying asthma may worsen due to the viral infection and inflammation in the airways, leading to increased symptoms and potentially respiratory failure.
3. Pseudomonas infection: Given the patient's history of bronchiectasis, she is at risk of developing a Pseudomonas infection, which can be difficult to treat and may require specific antibiotic therapy.
4. Antibiotic resistance: The patient has been colonized with quinolone-resistant E. coli, which may limit treatment options if she develops a bacterial infection.
5. Chronic kidney injury: The patient's stable creatinine level indicates chronic kidney injury, which may affect medication dosing and clearance.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms of dry cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week due to influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma. The patient tested positive for influenza but no bacterial pneumonia was found on chest X-ray. She has been receiving supportive care and antiviral medication (Tamiflu) for the influenza. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a slightly elevated heart rate. Her oxygen saturation is maintained at 97% with the use of a nasal cannula. The patient's lungs show diffusely scattered rhonchi, bronchial breath sounds, and early inspiratory crackles with prolonged expiratory phase. There are no signs of edema or calf pain, and her peripheral pulses are intact. 

Her laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting an infection. Her hemoglobin level is borderline microcytic and she has a history of iron deficiency. Her creatinine level is stable at 1.2, indicating chronic kidney injury. 

The patient has several chronic conditions, including asthma/bronchiectasis, osteoporosis, chronic kidney injury, anemia, and chondrocalcinosis. She is on multiple medications for these conditions, including inhaled corticosteroids, oral prednisone, calcium, vitamin D, and alendronate for osteoporosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms of dry cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week due to H1N1 influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma. The patient now presents with likely superimposed pneumonia.

The assessment and plan include the following:

1. PNEUMONIA: The patient's leukocytosis yesterday was likely due to superimposed pneumonia. She was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime, and her WBC count is now trending down. Given her known history of bronchiectasis and previous sputum culture growing out pseudomonas and E. coli, she will be treated with broad anti-pseudomonal coverage. She will continue on Vanc & Ceftaz pending sensitivities, and her WBC count and fever curve will be trended. She will be followed up with pending culture and sensitivity data.

2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS: The patient's respiratory distress is due to influenza and likely superimposed bacterial pneumonia in combination with underlying asthma. She will continue on tamiflu at 75mg po BID as her renal function has improved. Supportive care will include IV fluids, nebulizers, guaifenosin-dextromethorphan, and Tessalon perles. Acetaminophen will be held so as not"

","Summary:
Ms. [Known Last Name 10055], an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis, was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of dry cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week. She was diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and an exacerbation of underlying asthma, and now likely has superimposed pneumonia. Her current condition is improving, but she still has a cough and is not feeling febrile. Her WBC count was trending up, which led to ordering a chest X-ray showing new pulmonary infiltrate suggestive of superimposed pneumonia. She was started on vancomycin and ceftazidime, and her WBC count is now downtrending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to her history of bronchiectasis and previous sputum cultures growing out pseudomonas and E. coli, she will be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics including anti-pseudomonal coverage. It is important to monitor her WBC count and fever curve, and follow up with pending culture and sensitivity data.
2. Respiratory Distress: Her respiratory distress is due to influenza and likely superimposed bacterial pneumonia in combination with underlying asthma. She will continue to receive supportive care with IV fluids, nebulizers, guaifenosin-dextromethorphan, and Tessalon perles. Nebulizers for asthma will be given every 4 hours"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of asthma and bronchiectasis. She was admitted with symptoms of dry cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week. The initial diagnosis was H1N1 influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma. 

The patient is currently experiencing leukocytosis, respiratory distress, and hypertension. The leukocytosis is likely due to a new source of infection, as the white blood cell count is acutely worsening and does not correlate with the increasing steroid dose. The patient's chest X-ray shows possible new infiltrates that could be consistent with pneumonia. Given her known history of bronchiectasis and previous sputum culture growing out pseudomonas and E. coli, she is being treated empirically with Vancomycin and Ceftazidime for broad anti-pseudomonal coverage.

The respiratory distress is due to a combination of factors including influenza, possible superimposed bacterial pneumonia, and underlying asthma. The patient will continue to receive supportive care with IV fluids, nebulizers, guaifenosin-dextromethorphan, and Tessalon pearls. Albuterol nebs will be administered every four hours standing, with additional nebs as needed.

The patient also has hypertension, for which she is being continued on diltiazem for rate and blood pressure control.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old Hispanic female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis admitted with symptoms of influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma, likely superimposed bacterial pneumonia. She has been treated with antibiotics (Vanc and Ceftaz) due to concern for superimposed pneumonia. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 115/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. Physical examination shows mild use of accessory muscles, strong productive cough of yellowish-green sputum, diffuse wheezes on expiration and inspiration with rhonchi bilaterally, and no edema or calf pain. Lab results indicate leukocytosis improving, likely due to antibiotic therapy, and normal levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. The patient's renal function has improved, allowing for continued treatment with Tamiflu. Assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for pneumonia with Vanc and Ceftaz, supportive care for respiratory distress, and management of underlying asthma and hypertension. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP, and has a DNR/DNI code status."

","Summary:
Ms. [**Known Last Name 10055**] is an 82-year-old female with a history of asthma and bronchiectasis admitted with symptoms of dry non-productive cough, myalgias, and shortness of breath for one week. The patient's condition is due to H1N1 influenza and exacerbation of underlying asthma, now with likely superimposed pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and has been started on antibiotics (Vanc/Ceftaz) for suspected pneumonia. Her white blood cell count is trending down, but she still has leukocytosis. The patient's respiratory distress is due to influenza and likely superimposed bacterial pneumonia in combination with underlying asthma. She is receiving supportive care, including IV fluids, nebulizers, guaifenesin-dextromethorphan, and Tessalon perles. Prednisone is also being continued, along with nebs for asthma standing every four hours with PRN albuterol nebs. The patient's blood pressure is being managed with diltiazem. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications if not properly treated.
2. Respiratory Distress: The combination of influenza and superimposed bacterial pneumonia, along with underlying asthma, puts the patient at risk for worsening respiratory distress.
3. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating"
