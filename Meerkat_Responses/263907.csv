   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of HCV cirrhosis, prior perforated duodenal ulcer, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. He presents with symptoms including increasing back pain, generalized weakness, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and septic shock in the emergency department and received central line placement, IV fluids, and levophed.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 35 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 105-126 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 to 120/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low at 5 mmHg. Arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.46, PaCO2 27, HCO3- 104, and base excess -2.

The patient has a history of allergies to NSAIDs, aspirin, influenza virus vaccine, and an adverse reaction to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The patient's medical history includes asthma, syphilis, polysubstance abuse including cocaine, pulmonary hypertension, seizures, and duodenal ulcer perforation. Review of systems remains unchanged except for the noted symptoms.

Flowsheet data shows an intake of 2,733 mL of total fluids, with 2,613 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 120 mL of urine and 480 mL of blood products. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a CVP of 5 mmHg. The patient is receiving norepinephrine infusion at 0.16 mcg/kg/min and other ICU medications such as atrovent and protonix.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 60.5 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a Plt count of 560, hyponatremia with a Na+ level of 135 mEq/L, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile with PT/PTT/INR levels of 20.0/89.4/1.9.

The assessment and plan include respiratory distress due to left lower lobe pneumonia, septic shock, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, and hyponatremia. The patient is receiving IV fluids and weaning down levophed as tolerated, along with antibiotics for pneumonia, and prophylactic treatments for stress ulcers and deep vein thrombosis.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), worsening coagulopathy leading to bleeding, and potential development of antibiotic-associated diarrhea or Clostridium difficile infection due to the use of metronidazole."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV who presented with septic shock secondary to likely pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU and experiencing respiratory distress. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for sepsis and is being closely monitored for signs of exhaustion, which may require intubation. A tap is planned in the morning to address pneumonia/effusion, which appears loculated. The patient also has hypokalemia and hyponatremia, likely secondary to hypovolemia or a pulmonary process. Her coagulopathy is being addressed with vitamin K. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and if not adequately managed, could lead to respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which if left untreated or inadequately treated, can worsen and lead to further respiratory complications.
4. Empyema: The presence of leukocytosis and loculated infiltrate suggests the possibility of empyema, a collection of pus in the pleural space.
5. C. Difficile Infection: Leukocytosis could also indicate a Clostridium difficile infection, which needs to be considered and ruled out.
6. Hypokalemia and"

","The patient is a 67-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy and receiving vasopressor support. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient has been unable to wean off levo, indicating persistent respiratory support requirements.
- Oxygenation is being maintained with the use of a nasal cannula.
- The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is low, suggesting poor tissue perfusion and potential cardiac shock.
- There is a concern for fluid overload, as evidenced by the positive fluid balance and low serum creatinine.
- The patient's blood cultures were drawn, and he has been receiving antibiotics for suspected infection.
- The patient is receiving multiple medications, including norepinephrine, morphine, pantoprazole, and heparin.
- His vital signs show sinus tachycardia, low blood pressure, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis.
- The patient has a fever, with a maximum temperature of 35.6 degrees Celsius.
- His white blood cell count is elevated, and his platelet count is within normal range.
- The patient's kidney function appears to be impaired, with an elevated creatinine level.
- Other lab results show mild anemia, normal electrolyte levels, elevated lactate, and elevated liver enzymes.
- The patient has a history of peptic ulcer disease and allergies to NSAIDs and aspirin.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac shock: The patient's low mixed venous oxygen saturation and concern for fluid overload raise the possibility of cardiac shock, which can lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to wean off levo and persistent respiratory alkalosis indicate ongoing respiratory support needs, putting him at risk for further respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count, positive blood cultures, and ongoing antibiotic treatment suggest an ongoing or recurrent infection, which can complicate his recovery.
4. Kidney injury: The elevated creatinine level indicates impaired kidney function, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Peptic ulcer disease: The patient's history of peptic ulcer disease may contribute to his current condition or complicate his recovery if not appropriately managed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, cardiovascular function, kidney function, and infection parameters to prevent or manage these potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of hepatitis C virus infection who was admitted to the ICU with septic shock secondary to pneumonia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, morphine, pantoprazole, and heparin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she continues to experience respiratory distress and has a high leukocyte count. Her blood cultures have been taken, and she is being monitored for signs of exhaustion in case intubation becomes necessary. The patient also has hypokalemia and hyponatremia, which are being treated accordingly. Her coagulation profile is abnormal, and she is receiving vitamin K. The patient's condition remains stable in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, and there is a possibility of respiratory failure if her condition worsens. Close monitoring and possible intubation may be required.
2. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with septic shock, and there is a risk of further complications associated with sepsis such as organ dysfunction, multiple organ failure, or death.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not properly treated, leading to increased respiratory distress and potential spread of infection.
4. C. difficile Infection: The high leukocyte count raises concerns about a possible Clostridium difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and"

   # Septic Shock: fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, leukocytosis,
   with LLL infiltrate.  Likely Sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but
   leukocytosis so high that could be c.diff, but also empyema.
   - vanc/zosyn/flagyl/po vanc
   - added azithro the morning after admission for atypical coverage
   (urine legionella negative, though)
   - continue current abx regimen for now while waiting for c.diff,
   culture data
   - WBCs trending down, lactate up to 2.5 after LR resuscitation
   - f/u cultures
   - CVP > 12
   - MVP > 65 with levophed, still on 0.1 mcg/hr
   .
   # Leukocytosis:  considering c.diff due to high high leukocytosis
   - cont flagyl/vanc as above for c.diff until cx negative
   .
   # Respiratory Distress:  stable
   - O2 weaned to NC 4L, continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hemodynamics:  over the course of evening after  getting IVFs for
   shock physiology, CVPs started trending upward, JVD high on exam,
   likely with some R heart failure, stable.
   - mixed venous sats low
   - transfuse for goal Hct >30 for better oxygenation
   - would do pre and post mixed venous sats before and after transfusion
   - avoid any more IVFs
   - levofed as needed for pressure support
   # Low urine output:  unclear etiology unless just poor forward flow due
   to heart failure; cr stable

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV who presented with septic shock secondary to pneumonia and respiratory distress. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin, and metronidazole, for suspected c.diff, empyema, and pneumonia. Her WBC count is high, which could indicate c.diff or empyema, but urine Legionella test is negative. She is also receiving prophylactic medications for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's vitals show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. Her blood cultures were drawn, and she is being closely monitored for any changes in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome if not properly managed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia as the likely source of sepsis, and it needs to be treated aggressively to prevent complications such as respiratory failure.
3. c.difficile infection: The patient's high leukocytosis may suggest c.diff infection, which can cause severe colitis and lead to complications like toxic megacolon or perforation.
4. Empyema: Given the high leukocytosis and presence of LLL infiltrate, there is a possibility of"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with HCV cirrhosis and pneumonia. She is currently experiencing respiratory distress and septic shock. The patient's oxygenation has improved, but she is still on levophed.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), blood pressure ranging from 103/64mmHg to 87/55mmHg, heart rate of 94 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 95%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 36-40%.

The patient's blood cultures were taken at 10:43 AM, and an EKG was performed at 03:00 AM. She received antibiotics, including metronidazole, piperacillin, and vancomycin.

The patient is receiving infusions of norepinephrine and pantoprazole. Other medications include morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, azithromycin, vancomycin, and heparin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory distress. Her flow sheet data shows improved oxygenation but continues to require respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Her ABG results indicate normal oxygenation levels.

Physical examination reveals mild distress, crackles in the left base of the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and purposeful movement. Neuro"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who is currently in the ICU for septic shock secondary to pneumonia. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics (vancomycin and Zosyn), antifungal medication (Flagyl), and antipyretic (Levophed).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing moderate respiratory distress, which may indicate worsening pneumonia or development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Low urine output: The patient's urine output is low, which could be due to poor forward flow caused by heart failure or an obstruction in the urinary tract.

3. Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which may require repletion.

4. Relative hyponatremia: The patient has relative hyponatremia, likely secondary to hypovolemia or from a pulmonary process. Monitoring and treating the underlying cause is recommended.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulation abnormalities, and vitamin K may be necessary for prophylaxis.

6. Potential C. difficile infection: The patient's high leukocyte count raises suspicion for C. difficile infection, and empirical therapy is being administered.

7. Liver failure: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis suggests a risk for liver failure, which can lead to complications such as hepatic encephal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted to the ICU for septic shock secondary to pneumonia. She has been receiving multiple blood transfusions, antibiotics, and other medications to manage her condition. The patient's vital signs have stabilized, but she still requires levophed for blood pressure support. There are concerns about leukocytosis, low urine output, hypokalemia, relative hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and HCV status. The patient's current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with septic shock likely due to pneumonia. There is a risk of recurrence if the source of infection is not adequately treated.
2. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's critical condition and ongoing respiratory distress, there is a potential for multiple organ dysfunction, including renal, hepatic, and cardiovascular systems.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff): The patient has been treated empirically for C. diff due to high leukocytosis. If left untreated, it can lead to severe colitis and complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output could indicate an impending kidney injury. This can be exacerbated by factors such as hypotension and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Liver Failure: As the patient has HCV cirrhosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [sex] with a chief complaint of [complaint]. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of their condition. 

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received a blood transfusion due to low hematocrit (HCT) and central venous O2 saturation. This transfusion improved the patient's HCT to 62% and showed improvement in blood gases and tachypnea. However, the patient still requires the use of levophed throughout the day. 

The patient has allergies to NSAIDs, aspirin, and influenza virus vaccine. The last doses of antibiotics administered were piperacillin, azithromycin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). 

Infusions include norepinephrine and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications given include pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, and unspecified ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. 

Flowsheet data as of [date] shows the patient's vital signs with a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), current temperature of 35.3°C (95.5°F), heart rate of 95 bpm (90-117 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 91/63 mmHg to 115/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute (9-51 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia, central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg (10-19 mmHg), and mixed venous O2 saturation is between 40-62%. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,251 mL, output of 480 mL, and a positive balance of 3,771 mL. 

Respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula with oxygen delivery and an ABG result of 7.41/25/76 with a pH of 7.14, PaCO2 of 25 mmHg, PaO2 of 76 mmHg, HCO3- of 14 mEq/L, and base excess of -6. 

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and other findings as noted. 

Lab results show hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.6 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 31.7%, leukocyte count (WBC) of 53.9 K/uL, platelet count (Plt) of 678 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T of <0.01 ng/mL,"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50F with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duod
   ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Septic Shock: fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, leukocytosis,
   with LLL infiltrate.  Likely sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but
   leukocytosis on presentation was very high that C. diff was in
   differential as well as empyema.
   - vanc/zosyn for PNA
   - flagyl/po vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff; C. diff neg x 1 on
   [**3-2**]; will recheck C. diff today
   - discontinue azithro since low suspicion for atypicals (urine
   legionella was neg)
   - monitor WBC
   - f/u cultures
   - CVP > 12
   - Maintain MVP > 60 (pt likely has low-normal baseline BPs given
   cirrhosis; also waveforms on A-line tracing are dampened and A-line not
   drawing- BP reads may not be so accurate)
   .
   # Respiratory Distress:
   - O2 weaned to NC 4L, continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hemodynamics:  over the course of evening after getting IVFs for
   shock physiology, CVPs started trending upward, JVD high on exam,
   likely with some R heart failure, stable.
   - mixed venous sats still low however pt likely has low normal baseline
   BPs (cirrhotic) and pt is mentating well, and UOP picking up.
   - transfused 1u pRBCs overnight
 Hct 31.7 this morning.
   - D/C A line; use cuff pressure readings instead.
   - IVF fluid boluses as necessary
   - Recheck mixed venous saturation again this PM.
   - levophed as needed for pressure support, wean down as tolerated
   # Low urine output:  unclear etiology unless just poor forward flow due
   to heart failure; cr stable; UOP picking up now
   - will continue to monitor
   - consider obstruction workup if does not improve
   .
   # Chronic back pain
   - restart pt
s home dose neurontin
   - IV morphine for breakthrough pain
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  replete as needed.
   .
   # relative hyponatremia: likely secondary to hypovolemia or from
   pulmonary process.
   - stable in low-mid 130s. Treat underlying cause and monitor
   .
   # HCV:  No active issues.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: vit K
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: protonix 40 mg daily, SQ hep; get patient OOB, chest PT
   # Access: RIJ, PIVs
   # Code: FULL
   # Communication: Patient
   # Disposition: ICU as pt continuing to require pressor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duodenal ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with respiratory distress. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions to manage her condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing moderate respiratory distress, and there are rhonchi and crackles in the bases of the lungs. This indicates possible pneumonia or fluid accumulation in the lungs.

2. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and leukocytosis, which are consistent with septic shock. The likely cause appears to be pneumonia, but other possibilities such as Clostridium difficile infection and empyema have also been considered.

3. Low Urine Output: The patient has low urine output, which may be due to poor forward flow caused by heart failure or another underlying cause. Monitoring and further investigation are necessary.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PT/INR and low platelets, indicating coagulopathy. This requires close monitoring and appropriate management.

5. Hypokalemia and Relative Hyponatremia: The patient has low potassium levels and relative low sodium levels, which need to be addressed accordingly.

6. Chronic Back Pain: The patient has a history of chronic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis who was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia and respiratory distress. She underwent surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer. The patient's current condition includes severe back pain, hypokalemia, relative hyponatremia, low urine output, and potential complications related to sepsis and pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation with fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and leukocytosis indicates septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that can lead to organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of LLL infiltrate suggests pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory distress and potentially spread to other areas of the lungs.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: Although the patient tested negative for C. diff once, it remains in the differential diagnosis due to leukocytosis on presentation. Empiric therapy for C. diff was initiated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk for respiratory failure, requiring continuous monitoring and oxygen support.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: As the patient has HCV cirrhosis, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status.
6. Renal failure: The patient's low urine output may be"

","The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duodenal ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with respiratory distress. She has multiple medical complications including septic shock, respiratory distress, low urine output, chronic back pain, relative hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and hepatitis C.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation and can lead to organ failure.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress due to pneumonia. This can worsen if not properly managed, leading to further respiratory failure.

3. Low Urine Output: The patient's low urine output is unclear in etiology. If not addressed, it can lead to renal dysfunction or failure.

4. Chronic Back Pain: The patient has chronic back pain for which she is taking neurontin. If not managed appropriately, it can cause discomfort and affect her overall well-being.

5. Relative Hyponatremia: The patient has relative hyponatremia, which is a condition where sodium levels are lower than normal compared to other electrolytes. If not corrected, it can lead to neurological complications.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which means her blood clotting ability is impaired. This can increase the"

   Echo [**2160-3-3**]
   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function (LVEF>55%). The estimated cardiac index is borderline
   low (2.0-2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left
   ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular free
   wall is hypertrophied. The right ventricular cavity is markedly dilated
   with severe global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal septal
   motion/position consistent with right ventricular pressure/volume
   overload. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
   good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
   mild-moderate tricuspid regurgitatiaon. There is severe pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is a small, circumferential
   pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2159-7-11**], the
   overall findings are similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50F with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duod
   ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Septic Shock: fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, leukocytosis,
   with LLL infiltrate.  Likely sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but
   leukocytosis on presentation was very high that C. diff was in
   differential as well as empyema.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP given recent hospital stay.
   - flagyl/po vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff; C. diff neg x 1 on
   [**3-2**]; will recheck C. diff once pt has a BM
   - monitor WBC
   - f/u BCx; no growth to date
   - New goal: CVP > 16-18 (give LR boluses). Pt may need higher CVP to
   overcome severe pulm htn
   - Check BPs on other limbs.
   - Maintain MVP > 60 (pt likely has low-normal baseline BPs given
   cirrhosis)
   .
   # Respiratory Distress:
   - O2 weaned to NC 3L, continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hemodynamics: CVPs adequate (14-17). Mixed venous sat remains
   somewhat low.
   - IVF fluid boluses to keep CVP 16-18.
   - levophed as needed for pressure support, wean down as tolerated as
   long as pt mentating and UOP is adequate
   - Arterial line d/c
d yesterday
   .
   # Low urine output:  unclear etiology unless just poor forward flow due
   to heart failure; cr stable; UOP 25-60cc/hr now- adequate
   - will continue to monitor
   - consider obstruction workup if UOP drops off without clear reason
   .
   # Acute on chronic back pain; pt complaining of pain over the area of
   PNA.
   - restart pt
s home dose neurontin (pt states it
s for her
   [**Last Name (un) 254**]-[**Location (un) 1935**])
   - IV morphine for breakthrough pain while pt is recovering from PNA.
   - Pt refusing lidocaine patch (
doesn
t work
   .
   # Relative hyponatremia: likely secondary to hypovolemia or from
   pulmonary process causing SIADH.
   - Improving. Will monitor.
   .
   # HCV:  No active issues.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: vit K given. FFP PRN
   .
   # FEN: Consider maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: protonix 40 mg daily, SQ hep; get patient OOB, PT eval.

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duodenal ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with respiratory distress. She has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, IV fluids, and medications for pain management. Her vital signs are stable, but she is still dependent on pressors to maintain blood pressure. Her mixed venous saturation remains low, indicating ongoing oxygen demand. The patient's respiratory distress has improved, and she is being weaned off oxygen. Her urine output has also improved, but her renal function needs further monitoring. The patient has acute on chronic back pain and is receiving pain medication. She has relative hyponatremia, which is likely due to hypovolemia or SIADH. Her coagulopathy is being managed with vitamin K and FFP as needed. She is considered for enteral nutrition and regular diet once her condition improves. Prophylactic measures include proton pump inhibitor, hepatic enzyme supplementation, and deep vein thrombosis prevention. The patient's disposition remains in the ICU until she no longer requires pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Persistent hypotension and need for ongoing pressors: The patient's blood pressure remains dependent on norepinephrine, indicating possible inadequate perfusion and organ function. If the pressors are discontinued, there is a risk of hypotension and organ failure.
2. Respiratory distress and pneumonia: Although"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of severe back pain. The patient has been admitted to the ICU with a history of multiple medical conditions, including pneumonia, hypotension, hypovolemia, impaired physical mobility, acute pain, and chronic pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102/74 to 78/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a nasal cannula. 

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.17, indicating acidosis. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is maintained in the high 50s. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2,977 mL and output of 608 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,369 mL. 

Physical examination reveals moderate respiratory distress, rhonchi and crackles in the bases of the lungs, a tachycardic heart rate, and normal S1 + S2 sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft, diffusely tender, non-distended, and bowel sounds are present. There is a healing midline ex-lap wound with dehiscence at the caudal end but without erythema or drainage. The extremities are warm, well"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions and complications. He has a history of chronic pain, acute pain, hypotension (not in shock), hypovolemia (volume depletion without shock), impaired physical mobility, pneumonia, and other underlying health issues. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including norepinephrine, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), vancomycin, pantoprazole (Protonix), morphine sulfate, and heparin sodium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing further infections due to the use of arterial lines, nasogastric tubes, and urinary catheters.
2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated lactate levels suggest potential organ dysfunction, possibly due to sepsis or hypoperfusion.
3. Bleeding: The patient is receiving heparin sodium as a prophylactic measure against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). However, heparin can increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate a possible impairment in kidney function, which can be caused by sepsis, dehydration, or other factors.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient's mixed venous oxygen saturation is in the high 50s, indicating inadequate oxygen delivery to tissues. This"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50F with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duod
   ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Septic Shock: fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, leukocytosis,
   with LLL infiltrate.  Likely sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but
   leukocytosis on presentation was very high that C. diff was in
   differential as well as empyema.
   - vanc/zosyn for PNA
   - flagyl/po vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff; C. diff neg x 1 on
   [**3-2**]; will recheck C. diff today
   - discontinue azithro since low suspicion for atypicals (urine
   legionella was neg)
   - monitor WBC
   - f/u cultures
   - CVP > 12
   - Maintain MVP > 60 (pt likely has low-normal baseline BPs given
   cirrhosis; also waveforms on A-line tracing are dampened and A-line not
   drawing- BP reads may not be so accurate)
   .
   # Respiratory Distress:
   - O2 weaned to NC 4L, continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hemodynamics:  over the course of evening after getting IVFs for
   shock physiology, CVPs started trending upward, JVD high on exam,
   likely with some R heart failure, stable.
   - mixed venous sats still low however pt likely has low normal baseline
   BPs (cirrhotic) and pt is mentating well, and UOP picking up.
   - transfused 1u pRBCs overnight
 Hct 31.7 this morning.
   - D/C A line; use cuff pressure readings instead.
   - IVF fluid boluses as necessary
   - Recheck mixed venous saturation again this PM.
   - levophed as needed for pressure support, wean down as tolerated
   # Low urine output:  unclear etiology unless just poor forward flow due
   to heart failure; cr stable; UOP picking up now
   - will continue to monitor
   - consider obstruction workup if does not improve
   .
   # Chronic back pain
   - restart pt
s home dose neurontin
   - IV morphine for breakthrough pain
   .
   # Hypokalemia:  replete as needed.
   .
   # relative hyponatremia: likely secondary to hypovolemia or from
   pulmonary process.
   - stable in low-mid 130s. Treat underlying cause and monitor
   .
   # HCV:  No active issues.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: vit K
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer. She was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia, accompanied by respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/57 mmHg to 102/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is alert and oriented, with moderate respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals rhonchi and crackles in the bases of the lungs, a tachycardic heart rate, and a healing midline ex-lap wound.

The patient has been receiving multiple IV antibiotics for suspected pneumonia and C. difficile infection, but her WBC count remains elevated. She has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells overnight. The patient's CVP is trending upward, JVD is high on examination, and mixed venous saturation remains low. The patient is being closely monitored for hemodynamics, respiratory distress, low urine output, chronic back pain, hypokalemia, relative hyponatremia, HCV, coagulopathy, and prophylaxis measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 50F with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for perforated duod
   ulcer admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with
   respiratory distress.
   .
   # Septic Shock: fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, leukocytosis,
   with LLL infiltrate.  Likely sepsis secondary to pneumonia, but
   leukocytosis on presentation was very high that C. diff was in
   differential as well as empyema.
   - vanc/zosyn for HAP given recent hospital stay for total of 14 day
   course.
   - flagyl/po vanc for empiric therapy of C. diff; C. diff neg x 1 on
   [**3-2**]; will recheck C. diff once pt has a BM (will start gentle bowel
   regimen)
   - monitor WBC
   - f/u BCx; no growth to date
   - New goal: CVP > 16-18 (give LR boluses). Pt may need higher CVP to
   overcome severe pulm htn
   - Maintain MAP > 60 (pt likely has low-normal baseline BPs given
   cirrhosis)
   .
   # Respiratory Distress:
   - O2 weaned to NC 4L, continue to wean as tolerated
   .
   # Hemodynamics: CVPs adequate (14-17). Mixed venous sat remains
   somewhat low.
   - IVF fluid boluses to keep CVP 16-18.
   - levophed as needed for pressure support, wean down as tolerated as
   long as pt mentating and UOP is adequate
   - Arterial line d/c
d yesterday
   .
   # Low urine output:  Resolved.
   .
   # Acute on chronic back pain; pt complaining of pain over the area of
   PNA.
   - restart pt
s home dose neurontin (pt states it
s for her
   [**Last Name (un) 254**]-[**Location (un) 1935**])
   - IV morphine for breakthrough pain while pt is recovering from PNA.
   - Pt refusing lidocaine patch (
doesn
t work
   .
   # Relative hyponatremia: likely secondary to hypovolemia or from
   pulmonary process causing SIADH.
   - Improving. Will monitor.
   .
   # HCV:  No active issues.
   .
   # Coagulopathy: vit K given. FFP PRN
   .
   # FEN: Consider maintenance IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: protonix 40 mg daily, SQ hep; get patient OOB, PT eval.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 50-year-old female with HCV cirrhosis and recent surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer. She was admitted with septic shock likely secondary to pneumonia with respiratory distress. The patient's current condition includes septic shock, respiratory distress, low urine output, acute on chronic back pain, relative hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and potential complications related to her underlying conditions such as HCV and cirrhosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of fever, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoxia, and leukocytosis indicates septic shock. There is a risk of further deterioration if the infection spreads or if there is an inadequate response to antibiotic therapy.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which may progress to respiratory failure if oxygenation and ventilation parameters continue to deteriorate. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is essential.

3. Organ Dysfunction: Due to septic shock, the patient may develop organ dysfunction, particularly in the kidneys (acute kidney injury), liver (hepatic dysfunction), and lungs (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated PT/INR and low platelet count, indicating a coagulopathy. This increases the risk of bleeding complications if invasive procedures are required or if there is a deterioration in the patient's clotting"
