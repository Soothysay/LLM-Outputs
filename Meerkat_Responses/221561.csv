","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a past medical history of alcohol and heroin abuse. He was admitted for alcohol/opiate withdrawal and delirium tremens. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 182/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He is alert but somnolent after receiving diazepam. Physical examination findings are mostly within normal limits, except for distant heart sounds and mild fever. The patient has been treated with diazepam for EtOH withdrawal symptoms, thiamine, folate, and MVI. Opioid withdrawal symptoms are also being managed symptomatically with anti-diarrheals. Other diagnoses include GERD, apnea (likely OSA), FEN (fluids, electrolytes, nutrition), prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers, and VAP monitoring. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is pending above.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening alcohol withdrawal symptoms
2. Opioid withdrawal symptoms
3. Hypertension and potential development of hypertensive crisis
4. Thiamine deficiency leading to Wernicke's encephalopathy
5. Malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances due to FEN
6. Respiratory complications from opioid withdrawal or underlying O"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol and heroin abuse, admitted for alcohol/opiate withdrawal and delirium tremens. He has been experiencing tachycardia, labile hypertension, and mild fever. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 99.6°F, blood pressure of 179/96 mmHg, heart rate of 91 bpm, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and sinus tachycardia. The patient is alert but somnolent after receiving diazepam. Physical examination reveals clear lungs, supple neck, distant heart sounds, and no abnormalities in the abdomen or extremities. The patient has been started on diazepam per CIWA scale, methadone taper for opioid withdrawal, thiamine, folate, MVI, clonidine for hypertension of withdrawal, PPI for GERD, monitoring for apnea, and prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 520 mL total fluids, with output of 900 mL urine and 100 mL blood products. The patient's respiratory support is on room air with an oxygen saturation of 99%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient may be at risk for seizures due to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Infection: The patient's compromised immune system and alcohol abuse history"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol and substance abuse. He is currently experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms from both ethanol and heroin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 173/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has low lung volumes without any infiltrates on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. HYPERTENSION, BENIGN - The patient's high blood pressure is likely related to alcohol withdrawal.
2. ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL - The patient is showing signs of ethanol withdrawal, including agitation, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and hallucinations.
3. HEROIN WITHDRAWAL - The patient is also experiencing symptoms consistent with acute heroin withdrawal, such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
4. SEIZURES - The patient should be monitored for seizures, which can occur during alcohol withdrawal.
5. METHADONE TAPER - The patient's heroin withdrawal should be managed with a methadone taper.
6. PSYCHIATRY OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONSULTATION - Considering consulting psychiatry or substance abuse services for further evaluation and management.
7. HYPOXEMIA - The patient has episodes of low oxygen saturation while sleeping, suggesting obstructive sleep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and polysubstance abuse, currently experiencing acute withdrawal from ethanol and opiate. He presents with agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and potential hallucinations, which are consistent with ethanol withdrawal but also consistent with acute heroin withdrawal. The patient requires monitoring for seizures and administration of thiamine, folate, and multivitamins for ethanol withdrawal. Methadone taper will continue for heroin withdrawal, and consultation with psychiatry or substance abuse may be considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: Due to ethanol withdrawal, the patient is at risk of seizures. Close monitoring is necessary, and administration of benzodiazepines like diazepam can help prevent or control seizures.
2. Wernicke's encephalopathy: This condition can occur due to thiamine deficiency during alcohol withdrawal. Early administration of thiamine is crucial to prevent or treat this complication.
3. Delirium tremens: A severe form of alcohol withdrawal characterized by altered mental status, autonomic instability, and hallucinations. Close monitoring and supportive care are essential.
4. Opiate overdose: While the patient is currently in opiate withdrawal, there is a risk of accidental overdose if the patient accesses or is administered opioids without medical supervision.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's obesity and loud snoring suggest"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of increasing paranoia and demanding behavior. The patient received an additional dose of methadone and a one-time dose of ativan. Nicotine patch was started, and the patient was consulted by psych for additional recommendations. Robaxin was prescribed for muscle cramps, motrin for pain, bentyl for abdominal pain, imodium for diarrhea, clonidine TID, valium 10mg per CIWA, vistaril for anxiety, haldol and cogentin for acute agitation. It was determined that the patient does not have the capacity to leave against medical advice. The patient continued to receive medications overnight, including motrin, vistaril, methocarbamol, and valium.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal, including paranoia and agitation. If left untreated, alcohol withdrawal can progress to more severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens.

2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypertension. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart attack, stroke, or kidney damage.

3. Delirium: The patient's symptoms of paranoia, agitation, and altered mental status suggest delirium. Delirium can be caused by various factors, including alcohol"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol and heroin abuse. He was transferred from detox with symptoms of hypertension and tachycardia, which are concerning for ethanol withdrawal and opiate withdrawal. The patient remained in constant motion overnight but is now settling down.

Assessment and Plan:
1. EtOH withdrawal: The patient has symptoms consistent with delirium tremens, including tachycardia, labile hypertension, and mild fever. It is recommended to continue diazepam PO per CIWA scale, administer thiamine, folate, and MVI, and treat symptomatically with anti-diarrheals. Clonidine 0.1mg q4 should be given for hypertension associated with withdrawal.
2. Opioid withdrawal: The patient is experiencing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and goosepimples. It is advised to continue the methadone taper at a rate of 15mg decrease per 5 days, treat symptoms symptomatically with anti-diarrheals, and provide Clonidine 0.1mg q4 for hypertension related to withdrawal.
3. GERD: A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed.
4. Apnea: The patient has witnessed apneic episodes per ED. It is recommended to monitor the patient for now and provide nighttime O2 as needed due to suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
