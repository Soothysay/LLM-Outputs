   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipate frequent
   treatments
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who was found down and presented with altered mental status. He has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including acute alcohol withdrawal, coma caused by a combination of factors such as embolic strokes, substance abuse, possible withdrawal, hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness. Other conditions include rhabdomyolysis, infection (bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infection), acute renal failure, facial edema, liver failure, coagulopathy, compartment syndrome in the left upper extremity, ethanol withdrawal, intubation for airway protection, NSTEMI, and a positive urinary tract infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Continued progression of multi-organ dysfunction, including hepatic, renal, and respiratory systems.
2. Development of sepsis due to ongoing infections (bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infection).
3. Complications related to rhabdomyolysis, such as further kidney damage or compartment syndrome.
4. Possible relapse into substance abuse.
5. Complications from intubation and mechanical ventilation, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or damage to the trachea or bronchi.
6. Cardiac complications, including arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.
7. Bleeding complications due to coagulopathy.
8. Development of pressure ulcers or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was found down and subsequently intubated and mechanically ventilated. They were started on tube feeds and had a hemodialysis (HD) catheter placed at the bedside, requiring tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) due to difficulty accessing the femoral vein. The patient experienced high residuals during HD and aspirated, resulting in the need for suctioning of 700cc. The patient was also started on invasive ventilation, arterial line, multi-lumen catheter, and dialysis catheter. Blood cultures were obtained. The patient has no known drug allergies and received infusions of propofol and fentanyl. Lorazepam was administered as well.

   ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   .
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- On scheduled ativan for withdrawal prophylaxis
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   .
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   .
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis.
   .
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   .
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver failure
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   .
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 2 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   .
   #. ETOH withdrawal: has hx of ETOH withdrawl seizures
   -- Scheduled ativan 2mg IV Q6H as CIWA cant be measured now.
   .
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   .
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   .
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   .
   FEN: NPO for now
   .
   PPX:
   -DVT ppx: unnecessary given INR of 2.5
   -VAP ppx: mouth care, HOB elevation, IV H2 blocker

   Code status:
   Disposition:
","The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who was found down and presented with altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including coma, strokes, renal failure, liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, alcohol withdrawal, intubation, and NSTEMI. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include septic emboli due to endocarditis, further strokes, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), worsening renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and complications related to the NSTEMI such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, neurologic status, kidney and liver function, electrolyte levels, and cardiac status. Appropriate management should be provided based on the patient's condition and ongoing assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal
   given history of alchol abuse, in addition to emesis and diaphoresis
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x 1
   -- Midazolam for sedation, stop propofol
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, also sputum
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with NG tube and recent severe facial edema
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, anticipate frequent
   treatments
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with
   improved with aggressive benzodiazepine tx
   -- IV Valium boluse 15mg x PRN
   -- Midazolam for sedation
   -- Would not mask hypertension until withdrawal appropiately treated
   -- Avoid beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use
   -- If BP meds needed, would favor peripheral CCB as this would also
   help with CNS vasospasm
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derrangements
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis
   -- Monitor CKs
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Facial Edema: Concerning for angioedema
   -- D/C Cipro
   -- Continue Dialysis as above, suspect edema was secondary to gross
   overload from agressive hydration for rhabdo
   #. Liver failure: Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown to
   ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Coagulopathy: Likely secondary to liver disfunction
   -- FFP for active bleeding
   -- Would consider ddAVP also, although dose already given.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 3 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time
   #. NSTEMI: Troponin of 1.1 today, up from 1.02 yesterday but down from
   peak of 1.92 shortly after admission
   -- Likely from coronary spasm [**1-28**] cocaine intoxication
   -- Would consider aspirin
   -- Patient coagulopathic now
   -- Liver failure now and rhabdomyolisis, statin contraindicated
   -- Follow serial ECG's
   -- Would stop trending enzymes unless ECG changes are seen.
   #. Positive UTI: GPC, for now continue vanc
   FEN: NPO for now

The patient has undergone several interventions including dialysis catheter placement, removal of a femoral line, administration of extra doses of Vancomycin, and modification of tube feedings. The patient's current medications include fentanyl infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other ICU medications.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and potential complications related to dialysis.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, respiratory status, and laboratory values. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and manage the potential complications mentioned above."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- Discontinue Midzolam, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Avoid pure beta blockers in setting of amphetamine use, if ongoing
   would use Labetalol IV
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Concern for endocarditis with septic emboli given IVDU.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Continue vancomycin, needs redosing today given low trough
   -- Follow levels, dose qHD
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Vanc and Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Vanc and Unasyn should cover as well.
   -- D/C Cipro for concerns of angioedema.
   #. Acute renal failure: Started on dialysis, 5kg removed yesterday
   -- No HD today
   -- Needs more permanent access, would order tunneled RIJ today
   -- F/U Renal recs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Continue mechanical ventillation for now
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status. He is currently in the ICU and has multiple medical complications. The summary of the note includes:

1. Hypertension/tachycardia: The patient may be experiencing acute alcohol withdrawal, which is now being treated with benzodiazepines. However, benzodiazepines are not being aggressively given due to profound sedation.

2. Coma: The patient's coma is multifactorial, caused by multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse (including alcohol, IV heroin, and crack/cocaine), possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness. There is also a concern for endocarditis with septic emboli due to intravenous drug use. The patient is intubated for airway protection, and withdrawal prophylaxis is being given. Lactulose is also being administered for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution.

3. Infection: The patient has several sources of infection, including bacteremia with coag-positive staphylococci, aspiration pneumonia with MSSA, sinusitis, and a urinary tract infection. Appropriate antibiotics are being administered to cover these infections.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has started on dialysis and needs more permanent access. A tunneled right internal jugular catheter is"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Concerning for acute alcohol withdrawal,
   now appropriately treated with large doses of benzos
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation today
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   -- Start Labetalol PO 100mg TID, uptitrate as necessary
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- withdrawal prophylaxis as above
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to coag (+) staph,
   partial sensitivities available.
   -- Would D/C  vancomycin,
   -- Continue Unasyn IV x 14 day course
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event today.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube today
   -- Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Unasyn should cover as well.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- F/U Renal recs re: phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after agressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 5,000
   -- Continue agressive dialysis
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse. He is currently in the ICU due to altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient had significantly improved blood pressure and heart rate. The plan is to continue with Labetalol 100mg PO BID.

2. Coma: The patient's coma is multifactorial, including multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness. The patient is intubated for airway protection and sedation has been changed to propofol to attempt RSBI (Respiratory System Bilirubin Index). The patient's uremia is being managed with HD (hemodialysis). Withdrawal symptoms should be monitored, and lactulose is being given for possible hepatic encephalopathy. Metabolic derangements should be continued to be treated.

3. Infection: There are several sources of concern for infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection. The blood cultures show GPC's (Gram-Positive Cocci) speciated to MSSA (Methicillin-Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). The sputum culture is positive for Strep pneumo"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO TID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin, would restart this
   A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to sensitive coag
   (+) Staph.
   -- Would restart  vancomycin,
   -- Continue Unasyn IV x 14 day course
   -- F/U Cultures
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event.
   -- Sputum with MSSA
   -- Add Unasyn for gram negative coverage
   -- F/U daily CXR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis: Patient with OG tube now
   -- Unasyn as above
   D) Urinary track infection: GPC in urine also
   -- Unasyn should cover as well.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- F/U Renal recs re: phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could try RSBI
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse. He was found down by family members and is presenting with altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits, so there is no immediate concern for these conditions.

2. Coma: The patient's altered mental status can be attributed to several factors, including multiple embolic strokes, polysubstance abuse, possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, uremia, and critical illness. The patient is intubated for airway protection, and sedation has been changed to propofol to reduce agitation.

3. Infection: There are multiple sources of infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been started on vancomycin, Unasyn IV, and famotidine.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and a permanent catheter has been placed. Hemodialysis (HD) is planned, and renal recommendations regarding phosphate binders should be followed up.

5. Strokes: The patient has had strokes, which are concerning for embolic phenomena. No heparin drip has been initiated at this time, and neurologic recommendations should be followed up.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate renal failure (elevated creatinine and BUN levels), liver function abnormalities (elevated liver enzymes), rhabdomyolysis (elevated CPK level), and electrolyte imbalances (hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia). The patient also has compartment syndrome, which is a condition characterized by increased pressure within the muscle compartments, leading to tissue ischemia and potential muscle necrosis.

Additionally, the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, myocardial infarction, bacteremia, and other comorbidities. The patient is receiving appropriate ICU care, including arterial and central venous catheterization, dialysis catheter placement, and administration of antibiotics.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal failure, progression of liver dysfunction, further muscle damage due to rhabdomyolysis, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and sepsis.

Overall, the patient's condition is complex, and close monitoring and management are required to prevent and treat"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   #. Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Continue Labetalol 100mg PO BID
   -- Would not aggressively give benzodiazepines at this time given
   profound sedation
   -- If needed, would give IV Ativan 2mg PRN
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Infection: Several sources are of concern, given spike after
   stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum culture positive for Strep pneumo,
   sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed
   -- HD planned for today
   -- Renal recommended agains a phos binder
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 3,500
   #. Liver failure: Improving, Unclear contribution of muscle breakdown
   to ALT/AST/LDH. Suspect element of shock liver as well
   -- Continue to trend LFT's
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Now POD 4 S/p fasciotomy
   in the OR.
   -- Vac dressing in place
   -- F/U Ortho recs
   #. ETOH withdrawal: See above
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including hypertension, tachycardia, coma, infection, acute renal failure, strokes, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, left upper extremity compartment syndrome, ETOH withdrawal, and intubation for airway protection.

The patient's fever of 101.7 degrees Fahrenheit suggests an infection. The blood cultures are positive for MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) and NGTD (non-grouped, non-typable diplococci). The sputum cultures show heavy MSSA and PCN-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, but also 4+ GNRs (Gram-negative rods) on previous days. This indicates that the patient has several sources of infection, including bacteremia, aspiration pneumonia, possible sinusitis, and a urinary tract infection.

The patient also has acute renal failure, as evidenced by elevated creatinine levels and the need for permanent catheter placement and hemodialysis (HD). The patient's liver function tests show elevated ALT/AST levels, suggesting liver dysfunction.

The patient has experienced multiple strokes, with acute bilateral globus pallidus infarcts and acute to subacute infarcts in both cerebellar hemispheres seen on MRI."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   2) Respiratory: Patient maintaining excellent oxygen saturations on
   CPAP + PS with good RSBI.
   - Extubate today
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. Several sources
   are of concern, given spike after stopping Vancomycin. Also sputum
   culture positive for Strep pneumo, sensitive to Levaquin.
    A) Bacteremia: GPC's in blood cultures, speciated to MSSA.
   B) Aspiration pneumonia: Patient had witnessed aspiration event. 3+ GNR
   C) Concern for Sinusitis:
   D) Urinary track infection: MSSA in urine
   -- Vanc / Zosyn / Levaquin for hospital acquired pneumonia.
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   #. Coma: Multifactorial; MRI from OSH showing multiple embolic strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal, history of hepatic encephalopathy, now with uremia
   and critical illness.
   -- Intubated for airway protection, sedation had to be changed to
   propofol given increasing agitation overnight in hopes of attempting
   RSBI this AM
   -- Improved uremia from HD
   -- monitor for withdrawal
   -- On Lactulose for possible hepatic encephalopathy contribution
   -- Continue to treat metabolic derangements
   #. Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed on Thursday with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD
   yesterday. Cr slowly coming down.
   -- No HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   #. Strokes: Distribution concerning for embolic phenomena with embolic
   shower
   -- No heparin drip at this time
   -- f/u neuro recs
   #. Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   #. Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   #. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs
   #. Intubation: for airway protection, no known respiratory failure.
   -- Wean to PS today, if more awake could attempt extubation
   -- Unclear extent of neurologic impairment at this time

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has multiple medical complications including infection (GNRs in urine and sputum), bacteremia (MSSA in blood cultures), aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, urinary tract infection, hypertension, tachycardia, coma, acute renal failure, strokes, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, left upper extremity compartment syndrome, and intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The presence of GNRs in urine and sputum indicates a possible bacterial infection. This could lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.
2. Bacteremia: MSSA identified in blood cultures suggests bacteremia, which may progress to sepsis if not managed properly.
3. Aspiration Pneumonia: Witnessed aspiration event and 3+ GNRs in sputum culture indicate a high risk for aspiration pneumonia.
4. Sinusitis: The patient's sputum culture positive for Strep pneumo suggests sinusitis.
5. Urinary Tract Infection: MSSA in urine indicates a urinary tract infection.
6. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient's significantly improved hypertension and tachycardia need close monitoring to prevent complications.
7. Coma: Mult"

The patient's fever and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. The sputum culture is also positive for Strep pneumo, which is sensitive to Levofloxacin. Therefore, there is a potential medical complication of bacteremia due to MSSA. Additionally, the patient may have aspiration pneumonia, sinusitis, and urinary tract infection caused by MSSA.

The patient has had multiple strokes, as evidenced by the MRI showing acute bilateral globus pallidus infarcts and acute to subacute infarcts in both cerebellar hemispheres. This suggests a potential medical complication of embolic phenomena.

The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and uremia. A permanent catheter has been placed, and hemodialysis (HD) is planned for today.

Furthermore, the patient has rhabdomyolysis with a significantly improved CK level from ~40,000 at presentation to ~3,500 today. This condition has been complicated by acute renal failure but is improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection: Urine and sputum cultures growing GNRs. He was also
   growing MSSA in blood and MSSA/strep pneumo in sputum cultures. Also
   concerned about RIJ central line as a source of infection since he is
   spiking through broad spectrum antibiotics. He was started on Levaquin
   yesterday given strep pneumo in sputum.
   - Continue broad spectrum coverage with Vancomycin, Levaquin, and Zosyn
   - f/u cultures
   - d/c RIJ once adequate PIVs are placed; send tip for culture
   3) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Increase Labetolol to 100mg TID
   -- Ativan 2mg IV PRN for agitation
   4)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology reccs
   5) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal reccs
   6) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation. Complicated by ARF,
   Improving after aggressive hydration and dialysis. Significantly
   improved today with CK~ 1693. Continue to follow daily.
   7) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   8) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- Wound vac dressing tommorow
   -- f/u ortho reccs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse who presented with altered mental status. He has been in the ICU for several days and has been experiencing multiple medical complications. The patient's current conditions include infection with GNRs in his urine and sputum cultures, MSSA in his blood culture, and a possible central line infection from the RIJ line. He also has hypertension, tachycardia, neurologic issues with multiple strokes, possible ETOH withdrawal, acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and left upper extremity compartment syndrome. The patient is receiving various treatments including broad-spectrum antibiotics, labetalol for hypertension, ativan for agitation, lactulose for ETOH withdrawal, hemodialysis, and wound care for compartment syndrome. The patient's code status is full code and his disposition is currently unknown.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has multiple infections including GNRs in his urine and sputum cultures, MSSA in his blood culture, and a possible central line infection from the RIJ line. These infections can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient has significantly improved from admission but still requires medication to control his blood pressure and heart rate. If not properly managed, it can lead to complications such as cardiac arrhythmias"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 765**] is a 50M with a history of polysubstance abuse who is
   presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family
   members.
   1) Infection:  Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the
   sputum, GNRs in the urine.  Persistently febrile on vanc, zosyn,
   levofloxacin.
   -Can continue current coverage for now, for HAP and UTI.  Can take
   vancomycin off, as there is no MRSA identified.
   -F/u cultures
   -change foley
   2) Hypertension / Tachycardia: Significantly improved from admission.
   -- Titrate labetalol after dialysis
   -- Ativan prn
   3)Neuro: Multifactorial; MRI here confirms multiple strokes,
   polysubstance abuse, (including ETOH, IV heroin, crack/cocaine),
   possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness.
   -- Continue to  monitor for ETOH withdrawal
   -- Continue Lactulose
   -- Neurology recs
   4) Acute renal failure: Permanent catheter placed last week with no
   complications. Creatinine still remains elevated. He received HD on
   Saturday.
   -- HD today
   -- f/u renal recs
   5) Rhabdomyolysis: CK ~40,000 at presentation, continue to monitor CK
   daily
   6) Liver failure: Improving each day.  Follow daily LFTs.
   7) Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: Initially underwent
   fasciotomy on admission and wound vac now in place.
   -- To OR tomorrow for repeat debridement
   -- wound vac in place
   -F/u ortho recs

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient, a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, was admitted with altered mental status. He has been experiencing fever and has been on invasive ventilation. The patient has been extubated without any difficulties and has had multiple changes in antibiotic therapy due to resistant organisms identified in his sputum and urine cultures.

The patient's vital signs show persistent hypertension and tachycardia, which have improved significantly from admission. His neurological status is multifactorial, including multiple strokes, substance abuse, possible withdrawal, and critical illness. He is currently being monitored for ethanol withdrawal and is on lactulose.

The patient is also dealing with acute renal failure, with an elevated creatinine level despite having received dialysis on Saturday. His rhabdomyolysis is improving, but he continues to have high levels of CK. His liver function is showing improvement, and his left upper extremity compartment syndrome initially required a fasciotomy but now has a wound vac in place. He is scheduled for repeat debridement tomorrow.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The presence of resistant bacteria such as MSSA, PCN resistant strep pneumo, and Serratia marcescens indicates a risk of ongoing infection. Continued monitoring and follow-up cultures are necessary.

2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: Although"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, presenting with altered mental status after being found down by family members. The patient has multiple medical complications including infection (Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the sputum, Pseudomonas in the urine), hypertension/tachycardia, neurologic issues (multiple strokes, possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness), acute renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, liver failure, and left upper extremity compartment syndrome. The patient underwent fasciotomy on admission and is currently on wound vac with plans for a skin graft once medically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has Serratia, MSSA, and resistant strep pneumo in the sputum, and Pseudomonas in the urine. These infections can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Hypertension/Tachycardia: The patient has significantly improved from admission but still requires monitoring and management of blood pressure and heart rate.
3. Neurologic issues: The patient has multiple strokes, possible withdrawal now with uremia and critical illness. Monitoring for ETOH withdrawal and providing appropriate care is necessary.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal impairment. Continued monitoring and management of renal function, along with dialysis, is important.
5. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's CK levels are significantly elevated, indicating muscle breakdown. Continued monitoring of CK levels and addressing the underlying cause is necessary.
6. Liver failure: The patient's liver function tests show improvement but should be closely monitored.
7. Left upper extremity compartment syndrome: The patient underwent fasciotomy and wound vac placement. Monitoring for any signs of complications and planning for skin graft once medically stable is important.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's medical history, current condition, and potential complications. The patient's care should be managed by a healthcare professional based on their expertise and the specific needs of the patient."
