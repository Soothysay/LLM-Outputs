","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to this hospital with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNET ventilation, and her goal peak pressures are less than 30. She is also running negative on CVVH to ensure no element of fluid overload.

She is likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], with multiple possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She has positive blood cultures concerning for endocarditis and is being treated with Vanc/Zosyn.

The patient is also experiencing renal failure, possibly due to ATN or hepatorenal syndrome. She is oliguric at OSH with [**4-10**] cc UOP/h prior to transfer. Renal consult has been obtained, and dirty U/A is being followed up with urine cultures.

Her hepatitis is most likely alcoholic with a component of shock. She has evidence of cirrhosis on ultrasound, and portal vein thrombus is noted. Hepatitis serologies are being sent, and daily LFTs, coags, and plts are being monitored.

The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis that has improved, and she received CVVH overnight. Lactate is trending"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute kidney injury (ATN) or hepatorenal syndrome (HRS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's condition indicates signs of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an infection leading to organ dysfunction. Immediate intervention is necessary to control the infection and improve blood circulation.
2. ARDS: The patient has developed ARDS, a severe lung condition characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure and requires specialized ventilation support.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can be due to ATN or HRS. In either case, immediate intervention is required to prevent further deterioration of renal function.
4. Endocarditis: The patient has a positive blood culture concerning for endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. This can lead to serious complications if left untreated.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction. Treatment includes managing the underlying cause and supporting"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU with shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications including septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hepatorenal syndrome, altered mental status, and anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's condition suggests septic shock, which is a life-threatening complication characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Immediate intervention is required to manage the patient's vital signs and provide appropriate antibiotics.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure may progress to ARDS, a severe lung condition causing difficulty in oxygenation. Management includes implementing ARDSNET ventilation, maintaining oxygenation with FiO2 and PEEP, and closely monitoring the patient's response to treatment.

3. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): HRS is a type of kidney failure that occurs as a complication of advanced liver disease. The patient's oliguric renal failure and history of cirrhosis raise concerns for HRS. Further evaluation with tests such as urine output, renal function tests, and liver function tests is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, septic shock, and ATN, among other conditions. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving pressor support, and undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). The patient's liver function tests indicate alcoholic hepatitis with evidence of portal vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already positive for VAP, so there is a risk of worsening lung infection while on mechanical ventilation.
2. Line-related infection: With multiple lines and catheters in place, there is a risk of developing line-related bloodstream infections.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status.
4. Renal failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute renal failure, and there is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function.
5. Cardiac complications: Septic shock and ARDS can increase the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to Hospital1 due to shock, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with ARDSNET settings, paralyzed, and undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio consistent with ARDS. She is being ventilated with ARDSNET settings to minimize peak pressures and recruit alveoli. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary.
2. Septic Shock: The patient is suspected to have septic shock, possibly due to MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) and vasoactive medications (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg and central venous pressure (CVP) between 8-12 mmHg. Further surveillance cultures and diagnostic tests, including blood cultures, are needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has oliguric AKI at OSH with 4-10 cc UOP/h prior to transfer. Renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status and then transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, respiratory failure, and ARF. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, receiving vasopressin, midazolam, fentanyl, and norepinephrine infusions. She also has multiple IV lines, including an arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, likely septic shock, and renal failure (ATN or hepatorenal syndrome). Additional assessments and plans include hepatitis, portal vein thrombus, and elevated T.bili.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's P/F ratio is consistent with ARDS, and she is currently paralyzed. ARDSNET ventilation has been initiated, with goals of peak pressures <30, weaning FiO2 to 50%, and then weaning down PEEP. CVVH is being run negative to ensure no element of fluid overload.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, especially given the presence of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. Levophed is being used to maintain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder and cirrhosis admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). She is currently sedated and intubated.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and is being ventilated with ARDSNet ventilation. She is also on vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12.

There are multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), and pancolitis of unclear etiology. Surveillance cultures have been obtained, and antibiotics have been initiated.

The patient's renal function is impaired, and she is being treated with continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). The cause of AKI is uncertain, but it could be due to hypotension-induced acute tubular necrosis (ATN), hepatorenal syndrome, or complement-induced glomerulonephritis.

Other assessments include elevated total bilirubin levels, alcoholic hepatitis, portal vein thrombosis, and elevated liver enzymes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current ARDS requires careful management of ventilation parameters to avoid further lung injury."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old overweight/obese individual who is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient is unable to provide history as they are sedated and intubated. The patient has a history of cirrhosis of the liver, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/56 to 126/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on various medications and infusions, including vasopressin, midazolam, fentanyl, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), famotidine, and others.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 5,983 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an intake of 4,331 mL and output of 4,782 mL. The patient's urine output has been 5 mL, NG output has been 420 mL, and stool output has been 200 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, PEEP of 14 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and other parameters. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.42, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260, and other values within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, scleral edema, normal heart sounds, and no peripheral pulses assessed. The patient's neurologic status is not assessed due to sedation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 10.3 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) of 7.1 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 122 mg/dL, low potassium (K+) of 2.7 mEq/L, elevated glucose of 126 mg/dL, and other abnormalities.

The patient's imaging shows worsening pleural edema on the left compared to yesterday. The patient's microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include cirrhosis of the liver, ARDS, severe sepsis, acute renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is being managed with ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, lines placement, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is currently in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is intubated on pressors and CVVH. She has been improving in terms of ventilation and has a negative fluid balance. The plan is to continue ARDSNET ventilation, wean down PEEP, and prepare for possible tracheostomy. The patient will also have a run on CVVH today.

Medical Complications:
1. Anemia - The patient has elevated total bilirubin and direct bilirubin levels, indicating possible hemolysis.
2. Cirrhosis of the liver - The patient has a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, which may have contributed to her current condition.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - The patient is currently on ARDSNET ventilation and has been intubated due to respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis - The patient has been febrile since November 21st and has multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.
5. Renal failure - The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. She is currently on CVVH and her urine output is minimal.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to [Hospital1] with shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is intubated on pressors and CVVH. She has improved ventilation with a negative fluid balance. The plan is to continue ARDSNET ventilation, wean down PEEP, and prepare for potential tracheostomy. She will also run negative on CVVH today. ABGs will be done q8h. 

The patient likely has septic shock with multiple possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. OSH lines were removed, and a CVL was placed on [11-24]. Positive blood cultures are concerning for endocarditis, so surveillance cultures will be continued. The patient will continue on levophed and vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12, and wean as tolerated. 

The patient has acute renal failure likely due to ATN in the setting of shock. Persistent oliguria with 5-10 cc UOP/h will be managed by the renal team. CVVH will be continued, and pressors will be weaned with a goal MAP > 60. 

The patient's mental status is improving but remains off sedation with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated on pressors and CVVH. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The patient's ventilation will be managed with ARDSNET ventilation, aiming for peak pressures <30, and negative fluid balance will be maintained.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, characterized by fevers, possible sources of infection, and low blood pressure. The patient will continue to receive levophed and vasopressin to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65, central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12, and weaning of pressors will be done as tolerated.

3. Renal Failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. CVVH will be continued until the patient can tolerate another method of renal replacement hemodynamically. Levophed will be weaned as tolerated, and the patient will be evaluated for the need of hemodialysis in the long run.

4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is improving slowly, but she remains minimally responsive"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), ARF (Acute Renal Failure), and acute hepatic failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

From the vital signs, it can be seen that her temperature is within normal range, her heart rate is stable, and her blood pressure is on the lower side. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and her oxygen saturation is at 100%.

In terms of fluid balance, there is a negative fluid balance of 2,761 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving vasopressin and norepinephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure. She is also receiving calcium gluconate and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

The laboratory results show elevated levels of liver enzymes (ALT and AST), low albumin, and elevated lactate levels. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates a normal pH, slightly elevated PaCO2, and normal oxygen saturation.

Imaging shows bibasilar airspace opacity, which is consistent with ARDS.

The assessment and plan state that the patient has acute hepatic failure, ARDS, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is being managed with low tidal volume ventilation and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for ARF. The goal is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman who was transferred from the operating room with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and acute hepatic failure. The patient's condition is complicated by sepsis, distributive shock, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently on mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute kidney injury (ARF). The patient has positive blood cultures for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), so she is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The goal is to wean off vasopressin and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is still minimally interactive despite being off sedation for two days.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures should be taken to prevent this, such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing regular mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system compliance and lung sounds.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is immobilized due to being on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as using compression boots, should be implemented to prevent DVT.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at an increased risk of acquiring nosocomial infections due to her prolonged ICU stay and invasive lines. Strict adherence to infection control measures and regular monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values are crucial.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has acute hepatic failure, which may lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for changes in mental status and neurologic function is essential.
5. Renal dysfunction: The patient is receiving CVVH for ARF, indicating compromised renal function. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolyte balance is necessary.
6. Cardiac complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to sepsis and distributive shock. Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac enzymes is important.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note, and additional information may be required for a comprehensive assessment."

   45 year old woman with acute hepatic failure , thought secondary to
   etoh. Course complicated by ARDS and MODS. Still with low P:F, would
   favor AC with low tidal volume ventilation
   as long as she tolerates it off sedation. continues on CVVH for ARF.
   Hypotension secondary to distributive shock, on borad spectrum
   antibiotic with only positive culture being 1 bld culture of MSSA. Abx
   as per resident note. Weaning Norepi and vasopressin with goal MAP >
   60. As long as pressore coming down, agree with running CVVH slightly
   negative in effort to improve oxygenation. Further plans

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure (ARF), and acute hepatic failure. She is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is critically ill.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 87 bpm with a range of 84-100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/47 mmHg to 132/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute with a range of 18-29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient is receiving multiple medications and infusions, including vasopressin, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, potassium chloride, insulin, famotidine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in various parameters such as white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, liver enzymes, electrolytes, and arterial blood gas analysis.

Imaging studies reveal bibasilar airspace opacities on chest X-ray.

The patient's assessment and plan include low tidal volume ventilation, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), weaning of vasoactive medications, and ongoing monitoring and management of her critical condition"

   Otherwise no new culture data
   Imaging:
   [**11-30**] Chest x-ray: Read pending
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   -          Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   -          Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic
   encephalopathy
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies pending here.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool yesterday after initiation of reglan.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family today
[**12-1**]^st will work best
   for all family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will
   get back to us with convenient time in the afternoon for 1/109.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now transferred to
   [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors and CVVH.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology.
   Improved ventilation w/ negative fluid balance.  Continue to run net
   negative as long as pressors tolerate.  ABG stable, but given risk of
   high tidal volumes will transition back to AC.
   - ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs
   - goal peak pressures <30
   - will run her negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].  Would also consider
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - continue levophed and vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12 and
   wean as tolerated
   - f/u C diff antigen, blood, sputum, urine cx
   - cont Vanc/Zosyn
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures
   - plan for CT abdomen/pelvis here when stable to eval fluid collection
   -> too unstable to leave for CT at this time.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent Oliguria
   .  Further mgmt as per renal team - ? need for HD in long run if acute
   episode resolves.
   - cont CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement
   hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as pressor
   requirement does not increase
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - renal consulted, appreciate their input
   .
   # Mental Status: off sedation with minimal responsiveness, but
   improving alertness over last 24 hours.  would consider head CT and
   neuro evaluation if mental status does not continue to improve.  Will
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - head CT when able if mental status not improving.
   - follow mental status, and consider neuro consult for prognosis if
   does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Resend hemolysis labs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCTs
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, maintain net out
   - Iron studies, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S w/evidence
   of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: f/u Hep serologies from OSH
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - f/u OSH HIV antibodies
   - appreciate liver input
   - daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - consider paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point
   given on antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: KUB yesterday FOS, repeat today, continue
   tube feeds, add motility agents with raglan today.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Need family meeting to discuss overall plan. will
   depend on mental status.  Plan to meet on [**2123-12-1**].

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, who was admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated on pressors and CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. She is currently on ARDSNET ventilation, with a goal of maintaining peak pressures below 30. Regular ABGs will be performed to monitor her respiratory status.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock due to fevers since 11/21 and possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She is receiving levophed and vasopressin to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65 and central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12. Weaning of pressors will be done as tolerated.

3. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. She is currently on CVVH and will be weaned off pressors with a goal MAP >60. If the episode of renal failure resolves, hemodialysis may be needed in the long run.

4. Mental Status: The patient is off sedation with minimal responsiveness"

   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent Oliguria
   .  Further mgmt as per renal team - ? need for HD in long run if acute
   episode resolves.
   - cont CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement
   hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as pressor
   requirement does not increase
   - wean levophed as tolerated
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   - renal consulted, appreciate their input
   .
   # Mental Status: off sedation with minimal responsiveness, but
   improving alertness over last 24 hours.  would consider head CT and
   neuro evaluation if mental status does not continue to improve.  Will
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - head CT when able if mental status not improving.
   - follow mental status, and consider neuro consult for prognosis if
   does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Resend hemolysis labs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] HCTs
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, maintain net out
   - Iron studies, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S w/evidence
   of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: f/u Hep serologies from OSH
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - f/u OSH HIV antibodies
   - appreciate liver input
   - daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - consider paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point
   given on antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: KUB yesterday FOS, repeat today, continue
   tube feeds, add motility agents with raglan today.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Need family meeting to discuss overall plan. will
   depend on mental status.  Plan to meet on [**2123-12-1**].

She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been transferred to the ICU with shock, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and ARF (Acute Renal Failure).

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory status: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. Her Vt (Spontaneous) is 428 mL, PS is 15 cmH2O, RR (Spontaneous) is 24, PEEP is 8 cmH2O, FiO2 is 50%, RSBI is 66, PIP is 24 cmH2O, and SpO2 is 100%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient has a CVP of 8 mmHg, MAP of 65 mmHg, HR of 93 bpm, and BP of 99/46 mmHg.
- Renal function: The patient has oliguria with a urine output of 18 mL in the past 24 hours.
- Neurological status: The patient is awake, opens her eyes spontaneously, and appears to be trying to follow commands.
- Other observations: The patient has scleral icterus, PERRL (Pupils Equal and Reactive to Light), MMM (Mouth Midline Mouth), ETT (Endotracheal Tube) in place, and no signs of distress.

The patient's laboratory values show:
- WBC: 13.5 K/uL
- Hct: 23.1%
- Plt: 57 K/uL
- Cr: 1.2 mg/dL
- TCO2: 25
- Glucose: 102 mg/dL
- Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has ongoing medical complications, including respiratory failure, shock, renal failure, mental status changes, anemia, hepatitis, ileus/abdominal distension, and portal vein thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay. Close monitoring of vital signs, regular cultures, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if necessary.
2. Bleeding: The patient's elevated INR and thrombocytopenia increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters and careful use of invasive procedures are important.
3. Renal failure progression: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and renal replacement therapy may be required if there is no improvement in renal function.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's mental status changes may be related to hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring of liver enzymes and ammonia levels, as well as"

   Otherwise no new culture data
   Imaging:
   [**11-30**] Chest x-ray: Read pending
   Assessment and Plan:
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Decreasing ventilatory support needed over last
   24 hours, with improved oxygenation. It was felt patient had ARDS
   thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on
   CVVH, and appears to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only
   slightly negative in order to decrease and hopefully eliminate pressor
   need.
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but will switch
   over to PS and complete SBT, RSBI.
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   .
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E coli UTI, and pancolitis
   of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.  [**11-20**] MSSA [**12-2**]
   bottles, [**11-22**] GPC [**1-2**].
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently have weaned off levophed, will aim to wean off vasopressin
   to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Cont Vanc/Zosyn, but will clarify final culture results and aim to
   narrow antibiotics to specific bacterial sources, will need at least 2
   week course for bacteremia. (Will clarify outside hospital antibiotics
   and culture data)
   - follow-up OSH blood, urine and sputum cultures, HIV test
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   .
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance.
   Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   .
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Has been off all sedation for >36  hours.  Will likely
   be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and consider head CT/neuro consult for
   prognosis if does not improve.
   .
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 23 (up from 21). Elevated T.bili, D. bili
   9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   .
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likley w/component of shock. U/S
   w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus.
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: f/u Hep serologies from OSH
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - f/u OSH HIV antibodies
   - appreciate liver input
   - daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - consider paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point
   given on antibiotics for multiple days now)
   .
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: KUB yesterday FOS, repeat today, continue
   tube feeds, add motility agents with raglan today.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   .
   # Portal vein thrombus: nonocclusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   .
   # Goals of Care: Need family meeting to discuss overall plan. will
   depend on mental status.  Plan to meet on [**2123-12-1**].

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may experience worsening respiratory function, especially if there is a progression of ARDS or reintubation is required.
2. Shock: The patient is likely septic, and despite being on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing hypotension and organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of worsening renal failure or the development of acute kidney injury.
4. Hepatitis: Although the cause of hepatitis is suspected to be alcoholic, further evaluation is needed to rule out other infectious causes, such as viral hepatitis or autoimmune hepatitis.
5. Ileus/Abdominal Distension: The patient may continue to have issues with bowel motility, leading to further abdominal distension and potential complications like bowel ischemia or perforation.
6. Portal vein thrombus: The nonocclusive portal vein thrombus requires close monitoring, and anticoagulation should be considered once the patient's coagulation profile improves.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute etoh hepatitis and MODS. Respiratory
   function is improving with P/F now greater than 200. RISBI 66 this am.
   Will attempt
   SBT today but remain concerned that mental status will prohibit
   extubation. Continues on vasopressin but levophed off. Will run CVVH
   even
   today in hopes of getting her off pressors entirely. More awake today
   with non-focal exam , so suspect altered mental status is secondary to
   sedation and not
   structural lesion. Continue off of sedation. Hepatic function remains
   poor as evidenced by INR which is a poor prognostic factor despite
   improvement in other
   organ failures. Continues on lactulose and viral studies pending to
   complete w/u of acute hepatitis. Further plans as per resident.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute hepatic failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), and other medications. Her vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 91/41 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 497 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her renal function is impaired with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 23.1 mL/min/1.73m2. Liver function tests show elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, as well as low albumin levels. The patient's mental status is altered, but non-focal neurologic examination is noted. She is receiving nutrition through enteral feeding and regular insulin for glycemic control. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient remains critically ill, and further plans will be determined by the"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old woman with acute etoh hepatitis and MODS. PNA, ARDS.
   Respiratory function is improving with P/F now greater than 200. RSBI
   66 this am. Will attempt SBT today but remain concerned that mental
   status will prohibit extubation. Continues on vasopressin but levophed
   off. Will run CVVH even today in hopes of getting her off pressors
   entirely. More awake today with non-focal exam, so suspect altered
   mental status is secondary to sedation and not structural lesion.
   Continue off of sedation. Hepatic function remains poor as evidenced by
   INR which is a poor prognostic factor despite improvement in other
   organ failures. Continues on lactulose and viral studies pending to
   complete w/u of acute hepatitis. Further plans as per resident.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old woman with acute hepatic failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She was transferred from another hospital and is currently in the ICU. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 91/41 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 497 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired kidney function. The arterial blood gas analysis indicates respiratory acidosis with a pH of 7.35, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 264 mmHg.

The patient's condition remains critical, and she requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and vasopressin infusion to maintain blood pressure. The healthcare team is attempting a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to assess her readiness for extubation. However, they remain concerned about the patient's altered mental status, which may prevent successful extubation. The patient's hepatic function"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and appears
   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.  CXR
   shows possible increased infiltrate in RML.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will not wean vent today given increased sputum production
   - cont Zosyn; may need add
l abx if sputum culture positive
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is currently intubated on pressors and CVVH, but her mental status and respiratory status have been improving over the last 24 hours. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure. The current ventilator settings need to be closely monitored, and sputum production should be managed to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, as indicated by fevers since November 21st, multiple possible sources of infection, and positive blood cultures for MSSA. It is crucial to continue aggressive management of her hemodynamics, including weaning off vasopressors and maintaining adequate blood pressure and central venous pressure.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria, suggesting ongoing renal dysfunction. CVVH should be continued until she can tolerate another method of renal replacement hemodynamically.
4. Hepatitis: The patient is suspected to have alcoholic hepatitis, with evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis. Monitoring of liver function tests, coagulation profile, and platelet count is necessary. Repeat hep serologies should be obtained to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status and respiratory status over
   last 24 hours.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-2**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and appears
   to be close to euvolemic, will run even to only slightly negative which
   helped to eliminate pressory need (although she did need pressor again
   while on propofol).  Overnight had some green sputum suctioned.
   - send sputum for culture
   - will discuss ability to wean vent with team
   - Patient was on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs, but now on PS as
   trying to wean vent
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even to slightly negative on CVVH today as tolerated
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-21**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-22**], day
   1 treatment [**11-24**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-22**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-24**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed only because of propofol, will aim to wean
   off vasopressin to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative
   - Currently on Zosyn only, can switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.  UTI
   is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-24**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Will attempt to run out as long as
   pressor requirement does not increase
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today 22.5 (stable). Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9.
   In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - r/o infectious: Repeat hep serologies pending here
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP (although unclear benefit at this point given on
   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU due to shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure). She is intubated and on pressors, but showing improvement in mental status and respiratory status over the last 24 hours.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. This can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, possibly due to MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Shock can lead to organ failure and poor perfusion.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria, indicating possible acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion during shock. This can result in renal failure if not managed appropriately.

4. Hepatitis: The patient's history suggests alcoholic hepatitis, which may worsen during critical illness. Monitoring liver function and considering interventions such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or corticosteroids may be necessary.

5. Ileus/Abdominal Distension: The patient has had improvements in bowel motility, but close monitoring for ileus or abdominal compartment syndrome is essential to prevent further complications.

6. Portal Vein Thrombosis: Non-occlusive portal vein thrombosis has been identified, which can lead to complications like variceal bleeding or portal hypertension. Anticoagulation therapy may be considered once the patient's coagulopathy is corrected.

7. Mental Status Changes: The patient's mental status has been improving, but she may have prolonged recovery due to hepatic encephalopathy, electrolyte imbalances, or other factors. Monitoring and managing her mental status is crucial.

8. Infection: The patient has had multiple positive cultures indicating potential infections. Continued surveillance and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary to prevent or treat any ongoing infections.

9. Fluid Management: The patient's fluid balance needs close monitoring due to her critical condition. Excessive fluid administration can worsen pulmonary edema or increase the risk of renal failure.

10. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional status should be assessed, and enteral feeding may be initiated once her ileus resolves to ensure adequate nutrition during her recovery.

11. Medication Management: The patient is on multiple medications, including pressors, antibiotics, sedatives, and other ICU medications. Careful monitoring and adjustment of medication dosages are required to optimize her care.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of these potential complications to ensure the best possible outcome."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a medical history of cirrhosis, who was transferred from another hospital with acute hepatic failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). She is currently in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/58 mmHg to 152/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 7,518 mL and output of 9,587 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,069 mL. She has been receiving vasopressin, propofol, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate, and potassium chloride through continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Other medications include famotidine and unspecified others.

The patient's lab results show abnormalities in liver function tests, including elevated levels of AST, ALT, bilirubin, and liver enzymes. There are also abnormalities in kidney function, with elevated creatinine and BUN levels. Other lab results indicate low levels of albumin, low platelet count, and elevated white blood cell count.

Imaging shows a possible right middle lobe infiltrate. The patient's neurological examination reveals no spontaneous movement, with sedation present. Physical examination findings include soft, non-tender abdomen,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.

   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital

   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off

   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, will switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.
   UTI is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-

   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely ARDS. She also has septic shock with multiple potential sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. The patient has been receiving CVVH and various antibiotics, including Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently on norepinephrine and vasopressin for hemodynamic support. The patient's renal function is impaired, with anuria/oliguria and no significant change in renal function. She is also experiencing hepatic encephalopathy and anemia. The patient has had imaging showing improving pulmonary edema, resolving pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and a small right pleural effusion. Her blood cultures have been negative, and she has tested negative for HIV and C. difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) - The patient's increased sputum production raises concerns for VAP, despite the negative gram stain of sputum.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy - The patient's altered mental status may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, and lactulose is being used for treatment.
3. Renal failure - The patient's an"

   antibiotics for multiple days now)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: Much improved today, put out over 1 L
   stool  with reglan on board.
   - Consider CT A/P and paracentesis PRN
   - hold constipating medications such as opiates, and continue with
   bowel regimen.
   - Monitor for abdominal compartment syndrome
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given thrombocytopenia and elevated INR from liver dysfunction
   # Goals of Care: Spoke with family
[**12-2**] will work best for all
   family members to be able to make a family meeting. They will get back
   to us with convenient time in the afternoon for 1/109.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient's condition has worsened, leading to shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure). She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, as well as receiving vasopressors and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction. Imaging studies reveal improving pulmonary edema and resolving pneumonia, but also evidence of cardiomegaly and a small right pleural effusion. Blood cultures have been negative, and tests for C. difficile have been negative.

The patient's current medical issues include respiratory failure, septic shock, alcoholic hepatitis, renal failure, and hepatic encephalopathy. She is also at risk for complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and hepatic hydrothorax.

The plan of care includes weaning off sedatives and extubation when appropriate, continuation of ARDSNet ventilation, CVVH, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes. Antibiotics have been adjusted based on culture results, and the patient will receive a prolonged course of treatment for MSSA bacteremia. Renal assistance is being sought, and the goal is to transition from CVVH to hemodialysis when the patient is stable. Mental status improvement is closely monitored, and consideration is being given to a head CT and neurology consultation if the patient does not show improvement. Anemia management and further evaluation of the underlying cause of hepatitis are also part of the plan.

Overall, the patient presents with multiple complex medical issues requiring intensive care management and close monitoring."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Secretions improved today.  Appears to be
   a little less responsive to commands today.
     -PSV trial and wean sedation as able
     -If tolerates well, consider extubation based on MS
     [**Name13 (STitle) **] CVP to help guide fluid management
   Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding on propofol
      -As above, check CVP
      -Will change zosyn to nafcillin to treat MSSA bacteremia
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, currently even
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  INR continues to
   rise.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
     -Will try Vitamin K today
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who presented with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/47 to 119/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and she has a distended abdomen.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.7 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, platelet count of 47 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.2 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 105 mg/dL, and liver enzymes with elevated AST and ALT levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to ARDS, hypotension, renal failure requiring CVVH, liver failure secondary to alcoholic hepatitis, and altered mental status possibly due to ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient's current plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation support,"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Secretions improved today.  Appears to be
   a little less responsive to commands today.
     -PSV trial and wean sedation as able
     -If tolerates well, consider extubation based on MS
     [**Name13 (STitle) **] CVP to help guide fluid management
   Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding on propofol
      -As above, check CVP
      -Will change zosyn to nafcillin to treat MSSA bacteremia
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, currently even
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  INR continues to
   rise.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
     -Will try Vitamin K today
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse who was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. Secretions have improved today, but she appears less responsive to commands. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5 degrees Celsius, a heart rate of 92 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 103/47 to 119/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's height is 62 inches, and her weight is unknown.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 7,455 mL and output of 7,411 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 44 mL since 12 AM. Blood products have been transfused with a total input of 3,910 mL and output of 4,700 mL. Urine output is minimal at 5 mL. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, propofol, vasopressin, calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), famotidine, and others.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible PNA
   given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue nafcillin for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH
   (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on nafcillin for MSSA.  UTI is already treated by 7 day
   zosyn course.   Will need at least 2 week course of naf ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR rising, s/p vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors
   and CVVH, but with improving mental status.  Had increased sputum
   [**Date range (1) 4730**], so did not extubate.
   # Respiratory failure: It was felt patient had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis
 unclear etiology. She has been running negative on CVVH, and now
   euvolemic with CVP of 6, so will run even.   Concern for possible VAP
   given increased sputum, although gram stain of sputum negative and
   culutre pending.
   - f/u sputum cx
   - wean vent today, trial of pressure support
   - Stop Zosyn, narrow coverage to  nafcillin to cover MSSA in blood cx
   at OSH (Day 1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - Patient on ARDSNET ventilation, 6cc/kg IBW TVs when on controlled
   ventilation
   - Goal peak pressures <3,
   - Will run her even on CVVH today given she is 4L negative hospital
   stay and CVP of 6
   - q8h ABGs
   # Shock: Likely septic in the setting of fevers since [**11-20**], multiple
   possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of
   unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection.
   - OSH lines d/ced, CVL placed [**11-23**]
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade bacteremia
   - Currently back on levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean off
   pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - Currently on Zosyn only, will switch to Nafcillin today for MSSA.
   UTI is already treated.   Will need at least 2 week course  ([**11-23**]-
   [**2123-12-7**])for bacteremia.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   - Will defer CT abdomen/pelvis given that patient is clinically
   improving, and would not attempt to sample fluid.
   - Wean pressors with goal MAP > 60
   # Renal failure: No significant change in renal function. Likely ATN in
   setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/ oliguria. Appreciate renal
   assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and then transition to HD as
   needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.  Run even today (pt -4L hospital stay)
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable, HCT today. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting
   of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - start Epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Hepatitis: Suspecte alcoholic most likely with component of shock.
   U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). HIV
   negative from OSH (called today), CMV pending from OSH, hepatitis
   serologies negataive from [**2123-11-24**].
   - INR [**Last Name (LF) 548**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] treat with vitamin K 5mg IV x 1
   - Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - hep serologies negative
   - f/u CMV serologies at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   - Should patient develop fevers, clinical status worsen, would consider
   paracentesis for SBP
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension: resolved on reglan.
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Goals of Care: Family mtg today

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, sepsis, renal failure, and is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation, CVVH, and various pressors.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has increased sputum production, which is a risk factor for developing VAP. Cultures of the sputum are negative, but further follow-up is needed.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of alcohol abuse and cirrhosis, which increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose is being given to manage this condition.

3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function has not significantly changed, but there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. CVVH will continue until the patient can tolerate another method of renal replacement therapy.

4. Infection: The patient has multiple potential sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), and possible intra-abdominal infection. Cultures have been negative to date, and appropriate antibiotics are being administered.

5. Shock: The patient is still on vasopressin and norepinephrine for hemodynamic support"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various conditions. The patient has a history of drug allergies to penicillin and cephalosporins. 

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including vasopressin, propofol, norepinephrine, calcium gluconate (CRRT), insulin, famotidine, and others. The patient's vital signs show elevated heart rate (103 bpm), low blood pressure (81/42 mmHg), increased respiratory rate (26 breaths per minute), and normal oxygen saturation (100%). The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.3 degrees Celsius.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 8,512 mL with outputs of 8,276 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 236 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 12.7 K/uL and decreased platelet count (Plt) at 47. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition through Vivonex (full), glycemic control, arterial line, dialysis catheter, and multi-lumen line placement. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is also mentioned.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and the presence of an arterial line and multi-lumen line increase the risk of infection.
2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance may indicate fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or heart failure.
3. Hypotension: The low blood pressure may indicate inadequate perfusion and increased risk of organ damage.
4. Respiratory distress: The increased respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation suggest potential respiratory distress or failure.
5. Bleeding: The low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding complications.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for these potential complications and adjust the treatment plan accordingly."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - broaden to vanc/Ceftaz given spike last night through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - wean vent as tolerated
   # Fever
 to 101 on [**2123-12-2**] while on CVVH, so temp was likely even
   higher
   - broaden coverage as above
   - panculture
   - diagnostic paracentesis
   - changes all lines, send tips for cultures
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continues on 2 pressors with levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean
   off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and
   then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands. Was off all sedation for >48  hours, but back on given
   dysynchronous ventilation.  Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean propofol off
   -consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - Continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
    Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on raglan, continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Tolerating PSV for the moment. Requires
   substantial minute ventilation to account for metabolic acidosis
      -Discuss with renal if we can use CVVH to adjust metabolic acidosis
      -Continue to wean PSV as well.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding on propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
     -Continue pressor support
     -Fever w/u below
     -CVP goal [**7-12**]
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,

      -Pan culture pending
      -Diagnostic paracentesis
      -Change CVC.
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  INR continues to
   rise.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Better today

   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Tolerating PSV for the moment. Requires
   substantial minute ventilation to account for metabolic acidosis
      -Discuss with renal if we can use CVVH to adjust metabolic acidosis
      -Continue to wean PSV as well.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
     -Continue pressor support
     -Fever w/u below
     -CVP goal [**7-12**]
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,
   SBP
      -Broaden abx to vancomycin, ceftax
      -Pan culture pending
      -Diagnostic paracentesis
      -Change CVC.
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  INR continues to
   rise.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Better today

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred from another hospital due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently in the ICU and is critically ill. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has required pressor support. She has also been diagnosed with renal failure, liver failure, fever, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a serious lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory status needs to be closely monitored, and efforts should be made to wean her off the ventilator.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to septic shock or the addition of propofol. Close monitoring of blood pressure and ongoing pressor support are necessary. Further investigation for the underlying cause of the fever is required.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever, which could be caused by various factors such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related infection, or sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and diagnostic paracentesis, culture, and change of central venous catheter are planned.
4. Renal Failure: The patient continues to have renal failure, and CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being utilized to manage this condition. The goal is to maintain CVP ("

   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - PSV as tolerated
   - wean vent as tolerated, try [**4-4**] today, with possible extubation
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above, dose vanc by level with daily
   troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continues on 2 pressors with levophed/vasopressin, will aim to wean
   off pressors  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressors and
   then transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, appears to be attempting to follow
   some commands.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status, and try to wean sedation
   - consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Stable. Elevated T.bili, D. bili 9. In the setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse for HCT <21, monitor for evidence of bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH
   - HIV negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF, and is now intubated on pressors and CVVH.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure. The plan is to wean the ventilator and try extubation by day 4.

2. Fever: The patient's fever curve has trended downward, indicating improvement. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and daily trough levels of vancomycin will be monitored. Cultures will be followed up.

3. Shock: The patient is likely septic with multiple possible sources, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. The patient is currently on two pressors with levophed/vasopressin. The aim is to wean off pressors while maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 and central venous pressure (CVP) 8-12. Cultures have been negative to date.

4. Renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. Persistent anuria/oliguria is observed, and renal assistance is needed."

   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Requiring minimal vent support today.
   Secretions minimal
     -SBT now.  If [**Last Name (LF) 4767**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] extubate.
    Hypotension:  Seemed to correspond to adding propofol but new fever
   also concerning for septic shock as well
      -Wean as able when we stop propofol
      -Fever w/u below
      -CVP goal [**7-12**]
      -consider checking adrenal access if remains hypotensive
   Fever: Diff Dx include VAP (less likely), catheter related infection,
   SBP.  Fever curve improved now.  Lines changed.
     -Continue broad abx (vanc, cefep) for now.  Dose vanc by level.
     -F/u cultures
     -Change a-line
   Renal Failure: Continues on CVVH, goal to run CVP 8-12
   Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
      -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
   Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.
      -Continue lactulose and rifaximin

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to ARDS, requiring minimal ventilator support. There is also hypotension, which may be related to septic shock or propofol administration. Fever is present, possibly due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related infection, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient has ongoing renal failure requiring CVVH and liver failure secondary to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She has altered mental status, likely a result of ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure, progression of liver failure, worsening of renal failure, development of infections such as VAP or catheter-related bloodstream infection, and further deterioration of the patient's mental status.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, liver and renal function, and mental status. Appropriate management strategies should be implemented to address each of the identified complications. Regular evaluation of laboratory results, imaging studies, and clinical assessments is crucial in order to provide optimal care for the patient."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently in the ICU, requiring minimal ventilatory support and has a history of renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has experienced episodes of hypotension and fever, which may indicate septic shock or a catheter-related infection. Her altered mental status is likely due to a combination of factors, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's liver function tests and INR are being closely monitored. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, CVVH, and supportive care for her various organ failures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ARDS may lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Septic Shock: The patient's fever and hypotension could be indicative of septic shock, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy is a concern and may require further management with lactulose and rifaximin.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's ongoing renal failure may necessitate continued CVVH and careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels.
5. ICU Delirium: The"

   Microbiology: No growth of blood, sputum, or urine at [**Hospital1 19**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon weaned off, will aim to to
   maintain MAP > 60, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - ask renal they would consider CVVH now that pt off pressors and trial
   of HD
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital due to shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). She is currently intubated on pressors and continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure due to ARDS, fever, shock (likely septic with possible sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection, and pancolitis), renal failure (likely acute tubular necrosis in the setting of shock), mental status changes, anemia, alcoholic hepatitis with evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus, ileus/abdominal distension, and a non-occlusive portal vein thrombus.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 91/46 mmHg (62/40-110/76 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 4 mmHg, mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 91 mmHg, and urine output of 29 mL in 24"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through nafcillin
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon still on, will aim to wean off
   pressor  to maintain MAP > 65, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically.
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult for prognosis if does not improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/liver failure, respiratory failure/ARDS, and renal failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated on pressors and CVVH due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is now extubated but still altered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has ARDS, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs. It can lead to respiratory distress and failure.
2. Shock: The patient is likely septic with multiple possible sources of infection, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. This increases the risk of further deterioration in hemodynamic status.
3. Renal failure: The patient has likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. Persistent anuria/oliguria indicates impaired renal function. Renal assistance is needed, and the hope is to transition to hemodialysis (HD) as the patient tolerates it.
4. Mental status alteration: The patient has an altered mental status, which may be due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and the need for CVVH. Close monitoring is necessary, and consideration should be given to a head CT/neuro consult if there is no improvement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She was transferred to the ICU and received respiratory support. The patient was extubated yesterday and is now doing well. She has shown improvement in her hypotension and is no longer on pressors. Fever has resolved, and lines have been changed. The patient has renal failure, liver failure due to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, altered mental status likely due to ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy, and anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient was on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The presence of fever and altered mental status could be indicative of this complication.
2. Catheter-related infection: The patient has multiple lines and catheters, which can lead to infections. Fever and positive cultures may suggest a catheter-related infection.
3. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Patients with liver failure and cirrhosis are at risk for SBP. Fever and altered mental status could be signs of this condition.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, a complication of liver failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of ethanol abuse, who was admitted to the ICU for alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. The patient has been extubated and is doing well, but requires continued monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of vital signs, particularly oxygen saturation and respiratory rate, is necessary to detect any early signs of respiratory distress or failure.

2. Hypotension: The patient has shown improvement in hypotension after being weaned off pressors. However, ongoing monitoring of blood pressure is essential to prevent any further drops in blood pressure and potential organ dysfunction.

3. Infection: The patient has been febrile, which could be due to various causes such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), catheter-related infection, or sepsis. Continued surveillance for signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, or positive cultures, is crucial. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and cultures should be followed up.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has renal failure, as indicated by the need for CVVH. Close monitoring of renal function through laboratory tests is necessary. Timing of transitioning to hemodialysis should be discussed with the renal team.

5. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, leading"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, now intubated on
   pressors and CVVH
   # Respiratory failure: ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. Also concern for
   possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, no spikes since [**2123-12-2**]
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level
   (today 9.4) with daily troughs
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - levophed weaned off, vasopressinon weaned off, will aim to to
   maintain MAP > 60, CVP 8-12
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until [**2123-12-7**] (currently broadened to
   vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - ask renal they would consider CVVH now that pt off pressors and trial
   of HD
   - Renal recs
   - [**Hospital1 7**] lytes
   # Mental Status: Improving daily, extubated, but still altered, making
   inappropriate requests.  Will likely be slow to recover however given
   toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - continue lactulose for possible component of hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Elevated T.bili, D. bili . In the
   setting of HSM.
   - Transfuse 1 unit today for for HCT  of 21, monitor for evidence of
   bleeding.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - Iron studies as noted previously, guaiac stools
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP ab negative at OSH negative
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stop reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Portal vein thrombus: Non-occlusive. Hold on anticoagulation for now
   given that this is likely chronic (per liver team)
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis
   admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status
   transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors.
   [**Male First Name (un) **] successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade spike yesterday
   - continue broad coverage as above (cefepime), dose vanc by level with
   daily troughs
 f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures
   - paracentesis negative for SBP
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60,
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - continue gram positive coverage until tomorrow, [**2123-12-7**] (currently
   broadened to vanco/ cefepime for fevers)
   - UTI is already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: resolved. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There was
   also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**]) given spike through
   nafcillin; dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient remains hypotensive and requires one pressor. She is also on CVVH and has a fever curve that trended downward but had a low-grade spike yesterday.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. Fever: Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage (cefepime) and dose vancomycin by level with daily troughs. Follow up on all cultures.

2. Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E. coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic fluid collection. Continue levophed and aim to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 60. Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3 (precautions removed).

3. Renal failure: Likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. Persistent anuria/oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then transition to hemodialysis (HD) as needed. Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal replacement hemodynam"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of likely EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has experienced multiple complications during her ICU stay.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Septic shock: The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely caused by MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection, and pancolitis of unclear etiology. She remains hypotensive and requires continuous vasopressor support.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient has developed renal failure, likely due to ATN in the setting of shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy via CVVH.

3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient exhibits altered mental status and is at risk for hepatic encephalopathy. She is being treated with lactulose and rifaximin to manage this condition.

4. Alcoholic hepatitis: The patient has evidence of cirrhosis on ultrasound, and her hepatitis serologies are negative. She requires ongoing monitoring of liver function tests, coagulation profile, and INR.

5. Respiratory failure: The patient had ARDS previously but has now resolved. She required mechanical ventilation but has been successfully extubated and is maintaining"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing fever, respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, liver failure, altered mental status, and anemia. She is being treated with various medications and interventions to manage her conditions, including antibiotics, pressors, CVVH, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection. The presence of oral flora in the sputum culture could indicate aspiration pneumonia.
2. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's liver failure due to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis may lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy. Renal failure may result in further deterioration of kidney function.
3. Respiratory Distress: The patient's history of ARDS puts her at risk for acute respiratory distress, especially if there is a worsening of lung function or development of new complications.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's hypotension requires ongoing pressor support, which may indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability and potential cardiovascular complications.
5. Thromboembolic Events: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Prophylactic measures should be taken"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
   Fever: Febrile again this morning
     -Change A-line today
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Change cefepime to zosyn
     -Check LENI's
     -F/u cultures
   Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
    Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
      -Follow up cultures and abx as above.
      -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
      -Discuss with renal ? d/c fem line and place tunnelled if
   defervesces.
     Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Anemia:  Tx to keep HCT >21.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical complications.

1. Fever: The patient has had fevers throughout the day. The plan includes changing the arterial line, checking vancomycin levels, changing cefepime to zosyn, checking LENI's, and following up with cultures.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and was previously intubated but is now extubated and doing well. Aspiration precautions are being taken.

3. Hypotension: The patient still requires some pressor support, which may be related to a new fever or underlying cirrhosis. Follow-up cultures and antibiotics as mentioned above are planned. The central venous pressure (CVP) is being monitored between 8-12 mmHg.

4. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric (no urine output). Discussion with the renal team is ongoing regarding discontinuing the femoral line and placing a tunneled line if the fever subsides.

5. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Supportive care is being provided, and liver function tests (LFTs) and international normalized ratio (INR) are being"

   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade yesterday after 101.5
   on AM rounds [**2123-12-6**].  WBC increasing.  Other sources considered SBP
   (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]), sinusitis (no evidence sinus secretion).
   Concern for line infection: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**]
   (not yet replaced), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].
   Also consider abdominal source, esp with OSH CT scan showing pancolitis
   and ? peri-hepatic fluid collection
   - Abd CT (w/contrast if OK with renal), also will scan sinus and lungs
   - Renal will place new HD line and pull old one
   - changed cefepime to zosyn [**2123-12-6**], dose vanc by level with daily
   troughs
 f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures - ngtd
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**])
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Now stable. Guaiacs have been
   negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with acute liver failure, respiratory failure, renal failure, hypotension, and sepsis. She was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient has been extubated but remains hypotensive and requires 1 pressor. She also requires continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to renal failure. The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. Her white blood cell count is increasing, indicating an ongoing infection. She has been on various antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and now vancomycin-zosyn. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, and positive blood cultures suggest ongoing sepsis. There are multiple potential sources of infection including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection, and a possible abdominal source.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria, anuria, elevated creatinine levels, and need for CVVH indicate renal dysfunction. The cause of AKI is likely to be toxic-metabolic derangements, sepsis, and the use of nephrotoxic medications.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 curve trended downward, but low grade yesterday after 101.5
   on AM rounds [**2123-12-6**]
   - changed cefepime to zosyn, dose vanc by level with daily troughs
   f/u this AM
   - f/u all cultures - ngtd
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic with multiple possible sources including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]), and pancolitis of unclear etiology, and perihepatic
   fluid collection.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - Cultures here have been negative to date, c. difficile negative x3
   (precautions removed)
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**])
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line not working appropriately, needs to be replaced by
   renal; eventually needs tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
   - Renal recs
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: hct drifts every few days. Didn
t bump approp to 1 unit on
   [**2122-12-4**], likely hemolyzed given liver disease. Guaiacs have been
   negative.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 21
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input
   - Daily LFTS, coags, plts (have been stable, although Tbili 25)
   #Ileus/Abdominal Distension:
   - resolved on reglan, now having large stool output
   - stopped reglan, will add back if needed
   - continue TFs and lactulose
   # Respiratory failure: extubated. Had ARDS thought [**1-3**] sepsis. There
   was also concern for possible PNA given MSSA in sputum,
   - continue broad coverage vanc/cefipime (started [**2123-12-3**])--> changed to
   vanco/zosyn on [**2123-12-6**] for persistent fever
   - dose vanco by level
   - continue to cover for MSSA in sputum, as well as blood cx at OSH (Day
   1 = [**2123-11-24**], 2 week course)
   - extubated
   # Code Status: FULL, confirmed with family

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was later transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF, where she underwent intubation and mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
1. Fever: The patient has been febrile with a temperature of 100.5 degrees during the day. Antibiotics were switched back to vancomycin and piperacillin.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive and requires one pressor.
3. Sepsis: The patient is likely septic with multiple possible sources, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and pancolitis of unclear etiology.
4. Renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and is receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
5. Mental status: The patient is extubated but still altered. She will likely be slow to recover due to toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure, and the need for CVVH.
6. Anemia: The patient has a drifting hematocrit, likely due to hemolysis secondary to liver disease. Guaiacs have been negative, indicating no active bleeding.

   used.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.  Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up cultures and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing ICU care.

The patient has been febrile, with a temperature ranging from 38.1°C to 35.8°C. Blood pressure has been low, requiring vasopressor support. The patient's respiratory rate is elevated at 28 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation remains stable at 97%. The patient's heart rate is slightly elevated, ranging from 84 to 119 beats per minute.

Fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 872 mL since midnight, with input exceeding output by 3,153 mL compared to 4,002 mL output. The patient's urine output has been low, with only 563 mL collected since midnight.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired renal function.

Imaging studies reveal no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or cholecystitis. Chest X-ray shows low lung volumes, with a line in place but no effusions.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems. Immediate concerns include respiratory failure"

   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.
   Fever: Fever curve down today but also on CVVH.  WBC trending up.
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Cont Vanco/Zosyn
     -Resite CVVH catheter
     -F/u cultures
     -Abd/Chest/sinus CT. Discuss with renal if IV contrast can/should be
   used.
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
   Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up cultures and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Anemia:  Tx to keep HCT >21.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse. She was transferred to the ICU due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). The patient remains critically ill and requires ongoing medical support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and oxygen support may be necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient still requires pressor support, indicating possible persistent hypotension. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could be related to new fever, cirrhosis, or other factors.
3. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric, meaning no urine output. CVVH catheter replacement and ongoing renal support are essential.
4. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, leading to liver failure. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and INR is crucial.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient is likely experiencing ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. Managing this will involve lactulose and rifaximin administration, along with addressing potential contributing factors.
6. Anemia: The patient needs treatment to maintain a hematocrit (HCT) level above 21%.
7. Infection Risk: Due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # GI bleeding
 clots in stool.  Hct drifted down
   - transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   - transfuse 2 units FFP
   - repeat Hct @ noon; transfuse 1 more unit if not > 25
   - monitor
   # Fever
 Pt relatively hypothermic now, on bear-hugger.  CT showed
   concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis.  Flagyl
   added to vanco/zosyn to cover cdiff and dental source.  Repeat Cdiff
   tox ordered.  Other sources considered SBP (neg diagnostic para
   [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced
   [**12-7**]), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].  Attempt for
   changing dialysis line unsuccessful [**2123-12-7**].
   - dental c/s, pt cannot have panorex due to clinical instability;
   Dentist to see [**2123-12-9**]
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl -- vanco dose by level
   - f/u cultures, cdiff
   - Renal will re-attempt to place new HD line and pull old one
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known infections include MSSA bacteremia (OSH
   culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  Lines have been changed
   except for HD catheter.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - Renal recs

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD, etoh hepatitis/cirrhosis, admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF, intubated on pressors. She is now successfully extubated but remains hypotensive with one pressor requirement and is on CVVH.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has clots in her stool, resulting in a decreased hematocrit level. She has been transfused with PRBCs and FFP to address this issue.
2. Fever: The patient is relatively hypothermic and on a bear-hugger. A CT scan showed concern for a dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis. Flagyl has been added to vancomycin and zosyn to cover C. difficile and dental source. Repeat C. difficile tox is ordered.
3. Shock: The patient is likely septic, with known infections including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Recent imaging suggests pan-colitis and dental abscess. Culture data is negative at the current hospital.
4. Renal failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance. The plan is to wean the pressor and transition to HD as needed.
5. Mental status: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH.
   # Fever
 Pt relatively hypothermic now, on bear-hugger.  CT showed
   concern for dental abscess, as well as continued pan-colitis.  Flagyl
   added to vanco/zosyn to cover cdiff and dental source.  Repeat Cdiff
   tox ordered.  Other sources considered SBP (neg diagnostic para
   [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced
   [**12-7**]), and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**].  Attempt for
   changing dialysis line unsuccessful.
   - cont vanco/zosyn/flagyl -- vanco dose by level
   - f/u cultures, cdiff
   - Renal will re-attempt to place new HD line and pull old one; can
   consider tunnelled line now that pt afebrile
   - paracentesis negative for SBP [**2123-12-3**]
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known infections include MSSA bacteremia (OSH
   culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  Lines have been changed
   except for HD catheter.
   - TTE negative, TEE deferred given not high grade Bacteremia with low
   risk organism
   - continue levophed will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - CVVH to run even today given her hypotension
   - Cultures here have been negative to date
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia, however still febrile and
   covered broadly --> now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]
   - UTI was already treated by 7 day zosyn course.
   - HIV test negative at OSH
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD as needed.
   - Femoral HD line to be replaced by renal for fevers; eventually needs
   tunnelled HD line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with ESLD, etoh hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has multiple medical complications including shock, ARDS, ARF, pancreatitis, ileus, anemia, and respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and on pressors. She has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and flagyl for suspected C. diff and dental abscess. Her renal function is compromised, and she is on CVVH. She also has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. The patient's mental status is altered, and she may have hepatic encephalopathy. Her liver function is worsening, and she has evidence of portal hypertension. She is also experiencing abdominal distension and ileus. The patient's respiratory status has improved as she has been extubated. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening liver failure leading to hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy. The patient's renal function may continue to deteriorate if not adequately managed. There is a risk of infection due to the presence of multiple lines and the patient's immunocompromised state. The patient's ileus and abdominal distension may lead to further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation. Additionally, the patient's respiratory status can deteriorate if not closely monitored."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU from another hospital due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). She is now extubated and doing well. The patient has been diagnosed with fever, respiratory failure, hypotension, renal failure, liver failure, altered mental status, and anemia. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, for suspected sepsis and colitis. The patient's vital signs are unstable, and she requires norepinephrine to maintain blood pressure. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and signs of infection. Imaging studies reveal dental abscess, pan colitis, and diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities on the chest CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. If the infection is not appropriately managed, it can lead to sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of ARDS puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Any deterioration in her respiratory status may require reintubation and mechanical ventilation.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's liver failure due"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is currently extubated and experiencing fever, hypotension, renal failure, liver failure, altered mental status, and anemia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. The presence of diffuse bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) with some dependent consolidation on the chest CT suggests the possibility of pneumonia.

2. Liver failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure. The increasing bilirubin levels and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) indicate ongoing liver injury.

3. Renal failure: The patient is anuric and requires continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). There is a need to resite the CVVH catheter due to unsuccessful placement.

4. Altered mental status: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial altered mental status, including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring of neurologic function and continued lactulose and rifaximin therapy are recommended.

5. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and the presence of clots in her stool. Serial hemoglobin checks, transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin level above 25, and further"

   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status, and then transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is now successfully extubated but remains hypotensive with one pressor requirement. She is on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) and has evidence of ongoing pancolitis. The source of fever may be either pancolitis or dental abscesses. Dental cultures will be checked today, and the patient will be treated empirically for C. difficile infection.

Potential medical complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient had clots in her stool, and her Hct did not bump appropriately. She received 2 units of PRBCs, and the plan is to trend HCT, transfuse to >24, and maintain active T+C.
2. Shock: The patient is likely septic, with known prior infections including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Recent imaging suggests pan-colitis and dental abscess. Culture data is negative.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal failure is likely ATN in the setting of shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance. The hope is to wean the pressor and then transition to HD (hemodialysis).
4. Mental status: The"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.  Now
   extubated.
   Fever: Fever curve down, in fact, requiring bair-hugger while on CVVH.
   WBC stable today.
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Cont Zosyn, will stop Vanco and observe fever curve
     -Empiric flagyl given colitis on CT
     -Now that fever curve improved, will try to replace HD line with
   tunnelled line-->discuss with IR
     -F/u cultures including stool cultures
     -Dental consult pending regarding possible abscess.
   Anemia:  HCT down yesterday, some small clots in stool.
     -Serial HCTs, transfuse to keep HCT >25.
     -If bleeding becomes more [**Last Name (LF) 4886**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask for GI eval.
    Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up fever work up and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
     -Wean pressors as able
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Bili's still
   increasing without clear evidence of obstruction on CT.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
     -Will ask liver to comment on persistently rising bili's and the
   implications on prognosis
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.
   Rest of plan per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse, presenting with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient is currently extubated and showing improvement in her fever curve, but still requires pressor support. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/56 mmHg to 128/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient has a history of etoh abuse and presents with symptoms consistent with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Her liver function tests (LFTs) show elevated bilirubin levels without clear evidence of obstruction on CT. 

The patient also has anemia with a declining hematocrit (HCT) and is transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). 

She has renal failure, as indicated by her anuria and requirement for CVVH. 

The patient is experiencing altered mental status, likely due to a combination of factors including ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. 

Respiratory failure is also present, with the patient having ARDS. 

The patient's medical history includes poor dentition, which may be related to a possible dental abscess.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 yo F with h/o etoh abuse transferred from OSH where she presented
   with alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, ARF requiring CVVH.  Now
   extubated.
   Fever: Fever curve down, in fact, requiring bair-hugger while on CVVH.
   WBC stable today.
     -Check Vanc level today
     -Cont Zosyn, will stop Vanco and observe fever curve
     -Empiric flagyl given colitis on CT
     -Now that fever curve improved, will try to replace HD line with
   tunnelled line-->discuss with IR
     -F/u cultures including stool cultures
     -Dental consult pending regarding possible abscess.
   Anemia:  HCT down yesterday, some small clots in stool.
     -Serial HCTs, transfuse to keep HCT >25.
     -If bleeding becomes more [**Last Name (LF) 4886**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] ask for GI eval.
    Hypotension:  Still with some pressor requirement, may be related to
   new fever +/- cirrhosis
     -Follow up fever work up and abx as above.
     -CVP 8-12
     -Wean pressors as able
    Renal Failure: Still anuric
     -Resite CVVH catheter as above.
     -Would run even.
    Liver Failure:  alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Bili's still
   increasing without clear evidence of obstruction on CT.
     -Will continue to support through this and monitor LFT's/INR.
     -Will ask liver to comment on persistently rising bili's and the
   implications on prognosis
    Altered mental status:  likely multifactorial including ICU delirium,
   hepatic encephalopathy.  Reglan stopped for now.
     -Continue lactulose and rifaximin
    Respiratory Failure:  ARDS.
     -Now extubated and doing well.
     -Aspiration precautions.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of EtOH hepatitis and renal failure. They have been weaned off pressors and are currently off ventilatory support. A planned interventional radiology-guided tunneled hemodialysis line placement is scheduled for today. The liver prognosis is described as dismal. The patient's bilirubin levels are largely direct, but their haptic level is below 20. They have no known drug allergies. They have been on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and have remained afebrile.

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hepatitis: The patient has EtOH hepatitis, which can lead to liver damage and dysfunction.
2. Renal failure: The patient is already experiencing renal failure, which can result in impaired kidney function and the buildup of waste products in the body.
3. Liver failure: The liver prognosis is described as dismal, indicating a high possibility of liver failure, which can lead to multiple complications such as coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and fluid retention.
4. Infection: The presence of a yeast sparse growth in the sputum suggests a possible fungal infection, and the pending stool culture indicates a potential bacterial infection.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis, indicating a risk of stress-induced gastrointestinal ulcers.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient was on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
8. Dialysis catheter complications: The patient has multiple lines in place for dialysis, which can increase the risk of infection or other complications associated with catheter use.

Please note that this is a summary and potential complications based on the given information. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s to see today, unable to get panorex due to clinical
   instability
   - would taper down to only flagyl to cover both dental and c diff
   - f/u cultures, send 3^rd cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed over wire [**2123-12-3**]. Sinusists: neg CT.
   Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, now on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on
   vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**]. Would taper as above
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - per renal, if afebrile today, try to place tunneled HD line, can then
   d/c femoral CVVH line
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Has menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
    # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder, presenting with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has improved, with successful extubation but remains hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. She is on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) due to renal failure. There are concerns about ongoing pancolitis and dental abscesses. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), for which she was previously treated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's hypotension and requirement for vasopressors suggest ongoing sepsis, possibly leading to septic shock. The source of infection may be the dental abscesses or pancolitis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal failure is likely due to ATN caused by shock. Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be required until the patient can tolerate other methods of renal replacement therapy.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy. Treatment with lactulose and rifaximin may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of EtOH hepatitis and renal failure. The patient was weaned off levo overnight and is now off pressors. He is NPO pending IR-guided tunneled HD line placement today. The liver prognosis is described as dismal. The patient's bilirubin is largely direct, but his hapto is less than 20. His PM HCT is stable, and he has not received any transfusions recently. The patient is continued on CVVH and remains afebrile.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was transferred to the ICU due to alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is now extubated. The patient's current conditions include fever, anemia, hypotension, renal failure, liver failure, altered mental status, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of cultures are necessary to identify and manage any potential infections.
2. Bleeding: The patient has small clots in her stool and a decreasing hematocrit level, suggesting a risk of bleeding. Serial hematocrit monitoring and transfusion may be required to maintain a hematocrit level above 25. If bleeding worsens, a gastrointestinal evaluation may be necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient requires pressor support, indicating ongoing hypotension. This could be related to new fever, cirrhosis, or other factors. The patient's condition should be closely monitored, and further workup for fever and abx should be followed as mentioned in the plan.
4. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric, indicating ongoing renal failure. A tunnel catheter has been placed for dialysis, which will help in managing the renal failure.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol abuse who was admitted to the ICU for alcoholic hepatitis, shock, ARDS, and ARF requiring CVVH. She is now extubated but remains critically ill. The patient has several medical complications including fever, anemia, hypotension, renal failure, liver failure, altered mental status, and respiratory failure. She is receiving multiple medications and interventions to manage these conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever and is on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. This could be due to her immunocompromised state or other factors.
2. Bleeding: The patient has a low hemoglobin level and is experiencing some small clots in her stool. This could indicate bleeding, possibly from gastrointestinal sources.
3. Hypotension: The patient still requires pressor support, suggesting ongoing hypotension. This may be related to her new fever, cirrhosis, or other factors.
4. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric, indicating ongoing renal failure. A tunnel catheter has been placed for dialysis.
5. Liver Failure: The patient has alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with increasing bilirubin levels. There is no clear evidence of obstruction on CT.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status, likely due to ICU delirium and hepatic encephalopathy. She is being treated with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, but remains hypotensive with 1 pressor
   requirement. Remains on CVVH. Evidence of ongoing pancolitis
   # Fever
 Source may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses.
   Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although
   TTE was negative. Less likely line infection given persistently
   negative blood and catheter cultures. Temp regulated somewhat with bear
   hugger, no euthermic off of it. CT showed concern for dental abscess,
   as well as continued pan-colitis.
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - cont zosyn emperically, also continue flagyl to cover both dental and
   c diff
   - f/u cultures, repeat cdiff, but would treat with empiric 14 day
   course of flagyl
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),

t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**]
   - trend HCT [**Hospital1 7**]
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Shock: Likely septic.  Known prior infections include MSSA bacteremia
   (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew
   [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental abscess (see
   above).  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].  - continue levophed, wean as
   tolerated will aim to to maintain MAP > 60
   - has completed course for MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI, but was
   broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was on

   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; if change, repeat CXR
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new femoral HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - Continue CVVH until able to tolerate another method of renal
   replacement hemodynamically
 run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status, and then transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been intubated, extubated, and remains hypotensive on one pressor. She is also experiencing fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, renal failure, and altered mental status. The patient has undergone multiple interventions, including line changes, dialysis, and administration of antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has signs of sepsis, including persistent fever, positive blood cultures, and hypotension despite being on a pressor. This suggests the possibility of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient has a history of ARDS, which is a severe lung condition characterized by fluid accumulation in the alveoli, leading to difficulty breathing. Monitoring respiratory status and providing appropriate respiratory support will be crucial.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can cause altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms. Lactulose and rifaximin have been prescribed to manage this.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The presence of cl"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She is currently extubated but remains hypotensive, requiring one pressor. She is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and has evidence of ongoing pancolitis. There are concerns about possible aspiration, dental abscesses, and other potential sources of infection. The patient has a history of MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of previous infections (MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI) and is currently showing signs of possible septic shock. She may be at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Respiratory failure: Despite being extubated, the patient is requiring significant support with a nasal cannula and may be at risk for recurrent respiratory failure if her condition worsens.
3. Renal failure: The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoperfusion during shock. She is currently on CVVH and may require transition to hemodialysis once stable.
4. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, there is a concern for hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause altered mental status"

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to Hospital1 with shock, ARDS, and ARF, intubated on pressors. She remains hypotensive with one pressor requirement, successfully extubated, but remains on CVVH. The patient has evidence of ongoing pancolitis, fever, and a positive blood culture. The source of infection may be either pancolitis or dental abscesses.

The patient's past medical history includes MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Recent imaging suggests pan-colitis and dental abscess. Cultures have been negative at Hospital1. The patient is currently on vancomycin/zeosyn and flagyl.

The patient is now extubated, requiring 3L NC. There is a concern for aspiration during the replacement of the femoral dialysis line. The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and if there are any changes, a repeat CXR should be done.

The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance. The hope is to wean the pressor and then transition to HD. A new femoral HD line was placed on the left side on 12/10 without complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM). Remains on
   CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess.  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - was inadvertently > 2L  negative this AM with CVP of 1  - bolus 1000
   ML and run even rest of day
   - weaned levophed, aim to to maintain MAP > 60 off of it
   - remains on midodrine, would uptitrate instead of restarting levophed
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),
   and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono
   # GI bleeding
 had clots in stool [**12-8**].  Hct didn
t bump appropriately
   to 2 units prbcs [**12-8**], but later improved and then stabilized
   - trend HCT Daily
   - transfuse to > 24
   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with
   FFP; got new left IJ HD line on left on [**2123-12-10**] w/o complication
   - run even
   - lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal
   - trend HCT
   - transfuse for Hct < 24
     # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative
   - repeat [**Doctor First Name 3234**] u/s [**2123-12-6**] unchanged
   - Tbili rising may indicate that her liver failure worsening
   - trend INR, has been stable in mid-2
   - Appreciate liver input

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status.
- She was transferred to the current hospital with shock, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and ARF (acute renal failure). The patient was intubated and on pressors but is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors.
- The patient remains on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).
- She has had multiple infections, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and dental abscess. Cultures have been negative at the current hospital.
- The patient is still low-grade febrile on CVVH, and her WBC count is elevated. Possible sources of infection include aspiration during a procedure, pancolitis, or dental abscesses.
- She has received broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, zosyn, flagyl) and has completed courses for MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI.
- The patient had a recent episode of GI bleeding with clots in the stool. Her Hct did not bump appropriately after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells.
- She is now extubated and requiring 3L NC (nasogastric tube). There is a concern that she may"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM). Remains on
   CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess.  Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   - was inadvertently > 2L  negative this AM with CVP of 1  - bolus 1000
   ML and run even rest of day
   - weaned levophed, aim to to maintain MAP > 60 off of it
   - remains on midodrine, would uptitrate instead of restarting levophed
   - ABX:  has completed courses for both MSSA bacteremia and E cOli UTI,
   but was broadened when re-spiked, was on vanco/zosyn since [**2123-12-6**] (was
   on vanco/cefepime since [**2123-12-3**]), added flagyl [**2123-12-7**] for pancolitis and
   dental abscess;stopped vanco [**12-8**], but vanco then restarted on [**12-11**] for
   elevated WBC count in setting of recent line and ? aspiration during
   procedure
   # Fever
 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures
   - CXR [**12-11**] does not show new infiltrate
   - dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines:
   CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]),

   - maintain active t+c
   # Resp: now extubated, requiring 3L NC.  Per nursing, may have
   aspirated [**2123-12-10**] during replacement of femoral dialysis line
   - monitor respiratory status; CXR [**12-11**] does not look worse
    # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD.
   - could not get tunneled HD line b/c INR did not come down to 1.5 with

   # Mental Status: A+O x 2. Extubated, but still altered. Will likely be
   slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal
   failure and need for CVVH.
   - Follow mental status
   - consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   - TID lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: Had menses, Hct drifting down.  Also some clots in stool.
   - continue epogen per renal

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was intubated on pressors due to shock, ARDS, and ARF, but is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors. The patient remains on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and has multiple medical complications including shock, fever, GI bleeding, renal failure, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, possibly due to prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Etiology of septic shock could also include colitis and dental abscess. Cultures have been negative at the current hospital.
2. Fever: The patient still has low-grade fever on CVVH. There is concern for aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible sources may be colitis or dental abscesses. Vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl have been continued, and repeat cultures have been ordered.
3. GI Bleeding: The patient had clots in her stool on 12/8. Her Hct did not bump appropriately after receiving 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) but later improved and stabilized. Monitoring of respiratory status and trend HCT daily has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been intubated and on pressors, but is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors. The patient remains on CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient is likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement. Possible etiologies include MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, dental abscess, and pancolitis. She is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.
2. Fever: The patient still has low-grade fever on CVVH. There is concern about possible aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible sources may be pancolitis or dental abscesses. Repeat cultures are planned, and the dental consultation may be pursued once the patient is clinically stable.
3. GI bleeding: The patient had clots in the stool, indicating possible GI bleeding. Her Hct did not bump appropriately after transfusion, but later improved and stabilized. Daily monitoring of Hct is recommended, and transfusion should be considered if Hct falls below 24.
4. Respiratory status: The patient is now extubated and requires 3L NC. There is a concern about possible aspiration during the replacement of"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   - remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (will touch base

 Still low grade on CVVH.  WBC bumped on [**12-11**].  Concern that
   she aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use, presenting with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was admitted to the ICU and intubated due to shock but is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors. She remains on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient has been treated for MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and dental abscess, with ongoing fever and positive blood cultures. She also has evidence of GI bleeding, requiring blood transfusions, and renal failure with anuria/oliguria. Her mental status is still altered, and she requires assistance with activities of daily living.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient has had multiple infections, including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and a dental abscess. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, she remains febrile, suggesting a possible ongoing infection.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status needs close monitoring as she may have aspirated during the replacement of her femoral dialysis line.
3. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, and she is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for this condition.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, and"

   Microbiology: No cultures since [**2123-12-10**] 9most recent NGTD)
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
    # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status, and later transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient has been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, possibly caused by prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Imaging suggests pancolitis and dental abscess, and the patient is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Culture data is negative.
2. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but her WBC count is elevated. There is concern for aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia. Other possible sources include pancolitis or dental abscesses.
3. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance. The hope is to wean the pressor and transition to hemodialysis (HD), although maintaining MAPs off levophed is a concern.
4. Mental Status: The patient's mental status is fluctuating. She may recover slowly due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Restarted on pressors, suspect that her baseline BP is in
   this range.
     -Wean pressors today, MAP goal >50.
     -Add florinef
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn
     -As abx were empiric, will d/c them now
     -Change H2 blocker to PPI.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have been admitted to the ICU and are receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with hypotension and altered temperature. The patient is also experiencing vomiting. Lab results indicate liver failure, renal failure, anemia, and abnormal mental status. The patient has a history of poor dentition and jaundice. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating potential hypotension. This may be due to septic shock or other underlying causes.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Liver Failure: Elevated bilirubin levels and altered INR suggest liver dysfunction. This can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy.
4. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric (no urine output), indicating renal failure. This can result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This may lead to tissue hypoxia and fatigue.
6. Mental Status Alterations: The patient's mental status is altered, which could be due to various factors such as toxic-metabolic insults or ICU delirium. This increases the risk of falls, pressure ulcers, and other complications related"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Restarted on pressors, suspect that her baseline BP is in
   this range.
     -Wean pressors today, MAP goal >50.
     -Add florinef
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn
     -As abx were empiric, will d/c them now
     -Change H2 blocker to PPI.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU

   Imaging: no new imaging

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to Hospital1 with shock, ARDS, and ARF, intubated on pressors. The patient has been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to ESLD, medication effects, or consumption. She has been given one bag of platelets to increase her platelet count above 20,000.

2. Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock, possibly caused by prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Recent imaging suggests pan-colitis and dental abscess, for which she is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Culture data is negative.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved. Her WBC count is elevated, which could indicate aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia. Other possible sources of infection include pancolitis or dental abscesses.

4. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to shock. She is experiencing anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].

   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:

   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been through multiple complications and interventions. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's mental status is described as waxing and waning, and there is a mention of hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose and rifaximin have been ordered to treat this condition.

2. Infection: The patient had positive blood cultures suggesting possible MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. Vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl were started for treatment. Fever resolved, but the WBC count is elevated, indicating a potential ongoing infection. Dental abscess and colitis were also mentioned as possible sources of infection.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)/Renal Failure: The patient likely has ATN due to shock. Anuria/oliguria persists, and renal assistance is needed. CVVH is being utilized, but the patient is not stable enough for hemodialysis (HD) at this point.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a low platelet count and prolonged PT/PTT/INR. Fibrinogen is within normal range, but the patient is receiving epogen for anemia and active t+c (transfusion and"

   Imaging: no new imaging
   Microbiology: No new culture data since [**2123-12-10**]
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN for CVP 10-12; MAPS > 60
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- cont to wean levophed as tolerated
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**]
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

","The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital with shock, ARDS, and ARF, intubated on pressors, and now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors. She remains on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis).

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including:
1. Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement. Possible etiologies include MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, dental abscess, and colitis. The patient is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole.
2. Fever: Resolved, but the patient's WBC count is elevated again today. There is concern about aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other potential sources may include pancolitis or dental abscesses.
3. Renal failure: Likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock. The patient has persistent anuria/oliguria and requires renal assistance. The hope is to wean off levophed and transition to hemodialysis, although it has not been possible at this point.

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50.
     -D/C florinef as it likely has no effect in setting of renal failure
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's a
   little down over the last 2 days
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal

   Patient is critically ill.
","The patient is a 62-year-old male with no known drug allergies. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving multiple medications, including calcium gluconate (CRRT), KCl (CRRT), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and various other medications such as RISS, rifaximin, epogen, lactulose, midodrine, and florinef.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.6°C, heart rate 98 bpm, blood pressure 98/47 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals icteric sclera, diminished breath sounds bibasilar, soft non-tender abdomen, and distended extremities. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, able to follow simple commands, and respond appropriately.

   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50.
     -D/C florinef as it likely has no effect in setting of renal failure
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects include H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's a
   little down over the last 2 days
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Continue CVVH
     -If BP remains stable over the next 24-48 hours, would trial HD
     -Will need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU due to shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). She was intubated and placed on pressors. She has since been successfully extubated and is weaning off pressors. The patient remains on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and is experiencing thrombocytopenia. Her fever has resolved, but she has an elevated white blood cell count. She is also experiencing anuria/oliguria, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is concern for septic shock, possibly caused by MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection, or dental abscess. Imaging suggests pan-colitis. The patient's mental status is fluctuating and she may have hepatic encephalopathy. She also has anemia with clots in her stool and menses. Her prognosis is grave due to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can lead to bleeding complications.
2. Shock: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating ongoing instability. This can lead to poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
3. Renal failure: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption/DIC.  Slow oozing
   from cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.  Platelets 16
 11 overnight with one bag of platelets.
   -- will give two bags of platelets to get Plts > 20; will recheck this
   afternoon
   -- fibrinogen level pending
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- renal feels will not tolerate HD
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted
   to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred
   to [**Hospital1 19**] with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now
   successfully extubated, weaning off pressors (off this AM on [**2123-12-13**]).
   Remains on CVVH.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption.  Slw oozing from
   cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.
   -- will give one bag of platelets to get Plts > 20; will not recheck
   after transfusion
   -- trend with daily am labs
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- flurinef was started yest but unliklely to work b/c acts on kidneys
   and her GFR is essentially 0.  Will d/c.
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   - continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   - f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   -- Follow mental status
   --consider head CT/neuro consult in future for prognosis if does not
   improve.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts
   -- f/u liver recs (nothing new)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to [Hospital1] with shock, ARDS, and ARF, and intubated on pressors. The patient is now successfully extubated and weaning off pressors but remains on CVVH.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count due to multiple factors including ESLD, medication effects, and possible consumption. She is receiving platelets to increase her platelet count above 20,000.

2. Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock, possibly caused by previous infections such as MSSA bacteremia or E. coli UTI. Recent imaging suggests a dental abscess, and she is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and metronidazole. Culture data is negative.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but her WBC count is elevated. Possible sources of infection include aspiration during dialysis line placement, transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line, or sources related to pancolitis or dental abscesses. Other potential sources have been ruled out.

4. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in the setting of shock."

   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50, will check lactate for any signs of hypoperfusion
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects included H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
     -Check DIC labs
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Discuss with renal timing of HD trial.  Need to establish some
   endpoints since remaining indefiinitely on CVVH is not an option.
     -Would need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient remains off pressors and has shown improvement with stabilized vital signs. Their temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is low but consistent, respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and oxygen saturation is at 100%.

The patient's weight has slightly decreased since admission. Central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits. Fluid balance shows a positive total input of 9,693 mL and a positive total output of 7,057 mL since 12 AM.

The patient is receiving several medications including calcium gluconate (CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), RISS, rifaximin, lactulose, epogen, midodrine, and lansoprazole.

Vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, and fluid balance are documented. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their SpO2 is 100% without any respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals icteric sclera, poor dentition, no murmurs, diminished breath sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace edema in both extremities, jaundice, and no neurologic assessment performed.

Lab results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values such as potassium"

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Weaned off pressors overnight, suspect that her baseline
   BP is in this range.
     -MAP goal >50, will check lactate for any signs of hypoperfusion
    Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds.  Potential
   suspects included H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been
   stopped.
     -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
     -Check DIC labs
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -Discuss with renal timing of HD trial.
     -Would need tunneled line at some point.
    Anemia:  No signs of active bleeding.  HCT stable.
     -Transfusion goal >21%
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
     -Will monitor on risperdal
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now successfully
   extubated, still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function.
   # Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial from poor production [**1-3**]
   ESLD, med effect (stopped on vanco, zosyn & famotidine, which all have
   a risk of BM suppression), and possibily consumption/DIC.  Slow oozing
   from cracked corner of mouth, but otherwise no evidence of bleeding
   currently.  Platelets 16
 11 overnight with one bag of platelets.
   -- will give two bags of platelets to get Plts > 20; will recheck this
   afternoon
   -- fibrinogen level pending
   # Shock: Likely septic, with resolving pressor requirement.  Etiology
   of septic shock could include prior infections including MSSA
   bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI
   (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest pan-colitis and dental
   abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.  Culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved.  WBC bumped over last few days, started to resolve
   but higher again today to 11.8.  Concern that she aspirated [**12-10**] during
   dialysis line placement or had transient bacteremia from pulling the
   old femoral HD line. Other possible source may be either pancolitis
   versus dental abscesses. Also, have not pursued TEE after her positive
   blood cultures, although TTE was negative.  Other sources ruled out:
   SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).  Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line
   pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed
   [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.
   Dental c/s could not assess her well w/o panorex, recommend removing
   necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary surgery; currently too
   clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on [**12-14**] with no fever
   overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- f/u repeat cultures from [**2123-12-10**], still NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- will defer tunneled HD line placement at this point until more HD
   stable as will need many units of FFP and possibly platelets for the
   procedure and would like to make sure it is needed.
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- renal feels will not tolerate HD
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c (ordered to renew this morning)
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.
   -- Dailly LFTS, coags, plts

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol (EtOH) hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has been transferred to the ICU due to shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and acute renal failure (ARF). She was intubated on pressors but is now successfully extubated. 

The patient's current conditions include thrombocytopenia, likely multifactorial from poor production due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD), medication effects, and possibly consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). She has been receiving platelet transfusions and will continue to monitor her platelet count. 

The patient is also experiencing shock, which is likely septic in nature. The etiology of septic shock could include prior infections, such as methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, or an E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). Recent imaging suggests pancolitis and dental abscess, and she is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. 

The patient has resolved fever, but her white blood cell (WBC) count has increased again today to 11.8. There is concern that she may have aspirated during dialysis line placement or had transient bacter"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now successfully
   extubated, still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- off antibiotics except flagyl
   -- DIC is possible despite nl fibrinogen as this is also an [**Month (only) **]
   -- heaptic dysfunction also contributing
   -- will give two bags of platelets now, recheck post transfusion, but
   if DIC this will only
fuel the fire
   # Shock: Likely septic. Etiology of septic shock could include prior
   infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day 1
   treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]).  Recent imaging suggest
   pan-colitis and dental abscess; treating with vanco/zosyn/flagyl.
   Culture data negative at [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- fluid boluses PRN and/or titrating of CVVH parameters for MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever:Resolved, but now hypotermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no fever overnight and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting today to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   -- risperdal PRN for hallucinations, delirium
   # Anemia: Also some clots in stool & menses.  Has been stable in low to
   mid-20 over last few days.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who has been admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital where she developed shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors. The patient is now extubated but still dependent on CVVH, off pressors but still hypotensive without running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic function.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can be caused by various factors such as poor production due to ESLD (end-stage liver disease), medication effects (especially zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation).

2. Shock: The patient likely has septic shock, possibly due to prior infections including MSSA bacteremia and E. coli UTI. There is also a possibility of shock secondary to hypovolemia or cardiogenic causes.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but there is concern for hypothermia during CVVH. Possible sources of fever include aspiration during dialysis line placement, transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line, colitis, or dental abscesses.

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Has stayed off pressors but has required significant
   positive fluid balance. Lactate normal with MAPs in the 50's.
     -MAP goal >50
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds +/- abnormal
   sequestration +/- DIC +/- autoimmune.  Potential med suspects included
   H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been stopped.
      -Appreciate heme input.  Apparently coombs test today is positive.
   Will discuss with heme regarding ?need for steroids
      -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     -No plans to try HD given poor BP.
     -Will try holding CVVH to see if BP improves over the next 24-48
   hours.  If BP not better, would advocate to not restart CVVH.
    Anemia:  Diffuse oozing related to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
     -Transfusion goal >21%, 2 units PRBC today
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Hypotension:  Has stayed off pressors but has required significant
   positive fluid balance. Lactate normal with MAPs in the 50's.
     -MAP goal >50
   Thrombocytopenia:  Seems most likely related to meds +/- abnormal
   sequestration +/- DIC +/- autoimmune.  Potential med suspects included
   H2 blocker, Vancomycin, Zosyn all of which have been stopped.
      -Appreciate heme input.  Apparently coombs test today is positive.
   Will discuss with heme regarding ?need for steroids
      -Will transfuse platelets today given coagulopathy, goal will be
   >20.
    Liver Failure:  Bilirubin, INR remain significantly altered.  Bili's
   stabilized again in the high 20's
     -continue lactulose, rifaxamin.
     -Will monitor liver function if she can remain off pressors
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric
     - HD not an option given poor BP.
     -Will try holding CVVH to see if BP improves over the next 24-48
   hours.  If BP not better, options are extremely limited since     CVVH
   isn
t viable as long term therapy.
    Anemia:  Diffuse oozing related to coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia
     -Transfusion goal >21%, 2 units PRBC today
    Mental status:  Numerous toxic-metabolic insults as well as ICU
   delirium
   GOC:  Will try to meet with family again regarding considering
   withdrawal of care given her peristent liver/kidney failure and
   encephalopathy.

   24 Hour Events:
   - platelets continued to drop/not bump appropriately despite 3 bags
   platelets
   - did not transfuse any more after they were stable at 5K
   - oozing but no massive bleeding
   - Per heme, started trial of prednisone 1mg/kg daily for possible ITP
   and auto-immune hemolytic anemia, although they did not feel strongly
   about this. daily DIC labs ordered per heme
   - Family meeting: very difficult, code status still full, although
   discussion ongoing
   - run even on CVVH, bp with map around 50

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. The patient has since been transferred to another hospital, where she experienced shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated on pressors but is now extubated and dependent on CVVH. The patient remains hypotensive unless running CVVH positive and has worsening thrombocytopenia due to poor production (ESLD), medication effect, and possible consumption/DIC.

The patient's fever has resolved, but she can be hypothermic on CVVH. There is concern about possible aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible sources of infection may include pancolitis or dental abscesses. Lines have been changed multiple times, and other sources of infection have been ruled out.

The patient has renal failure, likely due to ATN in the setting of shock. Persistent anuria/oliguria has been observed, and the patient is currently unable to tolerate HD. Hepatic dysfunction is not correctable, and the patient's mental status is still altered.

The patient's anemia is stable, and she requires continued treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Alcoholic hepatitis is present with evidence of cirrhosis on ultrasound and portal vein thrombosis. Grave prognosis is expected.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) Heme-
      a) Thrombocytopenia likely multifactorial (DIC, liver disease, ?
   ITP).  Currently on Prednisone 90mg day.
           i) Will transfuse platelets only if bleeding given no response
   to platelet transfusions.  Avoid medicines known to cause
               thrombocytopenia.
          ii) Crit goal >21%
          iii) Check daily fibrinogens
          iv) DVT prophy with boots.
   2) CV
        a) hypotensive, likely at her baseline given her liver disease.
   Prior w/u to exclude infection has been unrevealing.
        b) On Midodrine to keep MAPs>50
   3) Resp- on RA.  Incentive spirometry
       a) Keep I/O's even to slightly neg as tolerated
       b) CHANGE nebs to standing, given wheezing (cardiac wheezes vs
   bronchoconstriction?)
   4) GI-
        a) on tube feeds
        b) Hepatitis likely [**1-3**] EtOH, other etiologies ruled out
             - Not transplant candidate
             - On Rifaximin, Lactulose
             - Not on SBP prophylaxis, not indicated
   5) Renal- ARF requiring CVVH , likely due to ATN
          - anuric
          - Continue CVVH
          - I/O = will keep even today, as blood pressures tolerate.
   6) ID- On flagyl for pan-colitis (likely moreso ischemic).  C. diff
   have been negative, but plan to finish 2week course flagyl.
   7) Endo- SUGARS OK

The patient is a 45-year-old individual with a history of EtOH-associated hepatitis and end-stage liver disease. They also have MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to acute renal failure (ARF). They were extubated on [**12-4**], but continue to have fluctuating mental status. The patient is still requiring CVVH and is anuric (not producing urine). They remain hypotensive and require midodrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 mmHg. The patient is thrombocytopenic with a platelet count of [**1-3**] and potentially has disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and an autoimmune process (positive Coombs test). They have been transfused with 3 6-packs of platelets without response and started on corticosteroids for presumed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

24-hour events include the administration of platelet transfusions without response, initiation of corticosteroid therapy, a family meeting regarding code status, identification of 2.5 liters of fluid positive, and stable MAP on midodrine.

Medications include calcium gluconate and potassium chloride through continuous renal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of alcohol-related hepatitis and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). He has multiple comorbidities including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complicated by acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The patient was extubated on [**12-4**] but has fluctuating mental status. He remains on CVVH and is anuric (not producing urine). The patient is hypotensive, requiring midodrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50 mmHg. He also has thrombocytopenia and there is a suspicion of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as well as an autoimmune process (positive Coombs test) and potential drug effect.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient received three 6-packs of platelets with no response in platelet levels. He was started on corticosteroids for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). A family meeting was held regarding the patient's code status, with no change. The patient tested positive for 2.5 liters of fluid accumulation.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.
   -- continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again

   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, renal failure and need for CVVH.
   Will defer neuro imaging.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to another hospital where she experienced shock, ARDS, and ARF, and was intubated on pressors. The patient is now extubated but still dependent on CVVH, off pressors but still hypotensive unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic function including worsening thrombocytopenia.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count due to poor production associated with ESLD, medication effects (especially zosyn & famotidine), and possible consumption/DIC. The plan is to continue prednisone for possible ITP or AIHA, monitor the medication list for contributors, and not transfuse additional platelets unless there is evidence of worsening bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient had septic shock, possibly caused by prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, pan-colitis, and dental abscess. All culture data are negative at the current hospital. The plan is to complete a course of flagyl to cover colitis, tolerate MAPS > 50, and remain on midodrine 10 mg TID.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel, peripherals smear per heme (fibrinogen > 100 on
   [**12-19**], will defer cryo transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-21**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU with shock, ARDS, and ARF. She is intubated on pressors, extubated since 12/4, but still dependent on CVVH, off pressors but still hypotensive unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic function including worsening thrombocytopenia.

Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) which may be due to poor production in end-stage liver disease (ESLD), medication effects (especially zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Steroids have been given for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Daily DIC panel and peripheral smear are recommended, and cryo transfusion will be deferred for today. Platelet transfusion will only be given if there is evidence of worsening bleeding.

2. Hypotension: The patient had septic shock with multiple potential sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, pan-colitis, and dental abscess. All culture data are negative at this time."

   protein)
   3. Renal- ARF [**1-3**] to ATN, ? overlap of HRS.
        a) remains anuric
        b) continue CVVH for indication volume overload state. [**Month (only) 51**] need to
   consider transitioning to HD with permacath and pressor support in near
   future if meaningful kidney function not anticipated
        c) TBB goal -500cc
   4. CV
       a) goal MAPs> 50; on midodrine
       b) Can discuss role of albumin
   5. Resp- Remains on RA.
       a) Will need MIE to help with secretions
       b) On bronchodilators
       c) Sit upright.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis.
- She was admitted to the hospital with MSSA bacteremia, E.coli UTI, and septic shock, complicated by ARDS and ARF.
- The patient was transferred to another hospital for CVVH and extubated but remains anuric and relies on CVVH.
- She requires midodrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPs) > 50.
- The patient has profound thrombocytopenia that is refractory to platelet transfusion, which may be secondary to portal hypertension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
- The patient received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for critical low hemoglobin level.
- She has clots in the NG lavage and even I/O despite CVVH.
- The patient is on various medications including KCl (CRRT), Calcium Gluconate (CRRT), rifaximin, flagyl, midodrine, lansoprazole, lactulose, prednisone, albuterol/atrovent nebs, and epogen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with a history of EtOH cirrhosis. She was admitted to OSH with MSSA bacteremia, E.coli UTI, and septic shock, complicated by ARDS and ARF. She was transferred to Hospital1 for CVVH and remains anuric, relying on midodrine to keep MAPs>50. She also has profound thrombocytopenia refractory to platelet transfusion, possibly secondary to portal hypertension, DIC, and ITP. 

The patient received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) this morning for a critical hemoglobin level (<21%). She has clots in her NG lavage and even output on CVVH. 

She has been receiving multiple medications, including KCl, calcium gluconate (CRRT), rifaximin, Flagyl, midodrine, lansoprazole, lactulose, prednisone, albuterol/atrovent nebs q6hr, Epogen, and others. 

Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission. She has a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 90 bpm (87-103 bpm), blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg (65/35-98/54 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (16-30 breaths per minute"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old homeless female with a history of alcohol use disorder (EtOH) and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), and septic shock. The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute kidney injury (AKI), requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She was transferred to another hospital for CVVH but is now back in the ICU.

The patient remains anuric (no urine output) and relies on midodrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50. She also has profound thrombocytopenia that is refractory to platelet transfusion, possibly due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), extrahepatic portal hypertension, or immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 93/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is extubated but relies on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) to maintain adequate oxygenation.

The patient's fluid balance shows an overall positive balance of 11 mL. Her central venous"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   overnight
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-20**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- to complete flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**];
   should end [**12-20**] in the pm)
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- continue flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Hope is to wean pressor and then
   transition to HD, though have not been able to maintain MAPs off
   levophed & unlikely to tolerate HD at this point.
   -- unable to get HD due to hypotension
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21 (ordered for one unit today)
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital and intubated due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is now extubated but still dependent on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and experiencing hypotension.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may be due to poor production associated with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), medication effects (particularly zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient is receiving solumedrol IV for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

2. Hypotension: The patient had septic shock, which could have been caused by prior infections including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli urinary tract infection (UTI), pan-colitis, and dental abscess. All culture data are negative. The patient is being treated with flagyl, midodrine, and CVVH to maintain blood pressure.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but she may be hypothermic during CVVH. There is concern that she may have"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder, presenting with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She was intubated and on pressors but is now extubated. She remains hypotensive and dependent on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH). Her hepatic synthetic function is failing, and she has worsening thrombocytopenia. The patient's medical complications include hypotension, fever, anemia, alcoholic hepatitis, and renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to be hypotensive, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage.
2. Fever: Although the patient's fever has resolved, there is still a concern for potential infections due to her compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, increasing the risk of bleeding.
4. Alcoholic Hepatitis: The patient has evidence of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, which can lead to liver failure and hepatic encephalopathy.
5. Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and persistent anuria/oliguria, indicating renal failure.
6. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's hepatic dysfunction, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which can manifest as confusion,"

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors but still hypotensive
   unless running CVVH positive, and with failing hepatic synthetic
   function incluing worsening thrombocytopenia.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- will change prednisone to solumedrole IV given poor liver function

   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol; will give additional Ca to make sure
   ionized Ca is > 1.12 (i.e., w/in normal) for clotting dysfunction
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at

   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative 500 cc as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU and intubated due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is now extubated but still requires CVVH and is hypotensive unless running CVVH positive. She also has worsening thrombocytopenia, likely multifactorial from ESLD, medication effects, and possible consumption/DIC. The patient's fever has resolved, but she can be hypothermic on CVVH. There is concern for aspiration or transient bacteremia during dialysis line placement or from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other potential sources of infection have been ruled out.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has worsening thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions, such as heme consultation and steroid trial, are necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains hypotensive unless running CVVH positive. This requires careful management with medications like midodrine and adjustments to CVVH settings.
3. Renal Failure: The patient likely has ATN in the setting of shock. Persistent anuria/oliguria indicates ongoing renal dysfunction. Renal assistance and close monitoring are required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of ETOH hepatitis and cirrhosis. He was admitted with MSSA bacteremia, sepsis, and acute tubular necrosis requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). The patient also has profound thrombocytopenia.

24-hour events include transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells for critical low hemoglobin level, therapeutic plasma exchange, and maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the range of 50-60 mmHg.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) is 37.2°C (98.9°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) is 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate (HR) is 89 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) is 84/44 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) is 15 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) is 99%, and heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 8,786 mL and total output of 9,299 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 513 mL. The patient's weight is 91 kg.

The patient's ABG results show pH 7.39, PaCO2 36 mmHg, HCO3 81 mEq/L, base excess -2, PO2 218, and SaO2 99%.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, sclera icteric, normocephalic head, NG tube in place, crackles on chest auscultation, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin 6.8 g/dL, white blood cell count 13 K/uL, platelet count 126 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 20 mEq/L, creatinine 0.9 mg/dL, sodium 139 mEq/L, potassium 4.3 mEq/L, chloride 106 mEq/L, calcium 10.5 mg/dL, and magnesium 2.2 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan:
The patient has ESLD with thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal failure, gastrointestinal issues, pulmonary toilet, and infection concerns. The plan includes continuing methylprednisolone for 3-4 days, transfusing PRBC for critical low hemoglobin, and only transfusing platelets if actively bleeding. CVVH will be continued for acute tubular necrosis."

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- at some point, will need to give CVVH holiday and attempt HD
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice
   chips [**12-20**]
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no
   improvement in synthetic function yet.  Grave prognosis.  TBili has
   been stable in the upper 20

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol-induced hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status, and then transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient has been extubated but remains dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient presents with several medical complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to multiple factors including ESLD (end-stage liver disease), medication effects (especially zosyn and famotidine), and possible consumption/coagulopathy disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Steroid trial was given for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). It is mentioned that the platelet count has shown slight improvement.

2. Hypotension: The patient had septic shock, and the etiology could have included prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia and E. coli urinary tract infection. The patient completed a course of Flagyl to cover colitis. The current plan includes maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 50, and the patient is on midodrine 10 mg TID (maximum dose).

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but there is concern"

   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to Hospital1 with shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is extubated but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP, and showing slight improvement in platelet count.

Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to poor production (ESLD), medication effects (especially zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/DIC. Steroid trial is being considered for possible ITP or AIHA. Daily DIC panel is being monitored, and cryo transfusion may be deferred.

2. Hypotension: The patient had septic shock, which could have included prior infections such as MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, and dental abscess. All culture data are negative. The patient is on midodrine 10 mg TID and tolerates MAPS > 50.

3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved, but she can be hypothermic on CVVH. Possible sources of fever include aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line.

4. Renal Failure: The patient likely has ATN in the setting of shock. Persistent anuria/olig"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who was initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia.

The patient's thrombocytopenia is likely multifactorial and he is currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The plan is to continue methylprednisolone for 3-4 days per heme, reserving platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding. The patient also received a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) for a critical platelet count of less than 21.

The patient remains anuric and his blood pressure is marginal today after a negative fluid balance yesterday. It will be discussed with the renal team about the possibility of a CVVH holiday and an attempt at hemodialysis (HD) in the near future.

The patient's hypotension is managed with midodrine. The plan is to continue lactulose and rifaximin for encephalopathy, as well as ciprofloxacin for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. The patient's pulmonary status has improved but he still remains at an increased risk of aspiration. Pulmonary toilet will be continued.

   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
     -Continue methylprednisolone for 3-4 days per heme.  Reserving
   platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding.
     -Transfuse PRBC for crit<21 although may need to rethink Hct
   threshold to allow HD without pressors. Possibly at 25-27. will recheck
   retic count and smear daily. ? candidacy for IVIG if steroid resistant
   Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  BP's marginal today after negative
   fluid balance yesterday.
     -Will discuss with renal about possibility of a CVVH holiday and
   attempt at HD in near future . would prefer to have Hct higher prior to
   HD.
   Hypotension: BP's marginal but tolerating fluid removal over the last
   36 hours.  No signs of infection at present
     -Continue midodrine
   Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis.
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with ESLD (end-stage liver disease) initially admitted for acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by ARF (acute renal failure) requiring CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Thrombocytopenia: likely multifactorial, currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Continuing methylprednisolone for 3-4 days per heme, reserving platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding.
- Renal Failure: remains anuric (no urine output). BP's marginal today after negative fluid balance yesterday.
- Hypotension: BP's marginal but tolerating fluid removal over the last 36 hours. No signs of infection at present.
- Cirrhosis: continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy. On cipro for SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) prophylaxis.
- Pulmonary: status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased risk of aspiration.
- GOC (goals of care): ongoing discussions with family.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice
   chips [**12-20**]
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.
   + direct coomb
s test.
   --continue epogen per renal
   -- transfuse to > 21
   - maintain active t+c
   - solumedrol for AIA
   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was later transferred to Hospital1 due to shock, ARDS, and ARF.

2. The patient has been extubated since 12/4 but remains CVVH dependent and off pressors, tolerating low blood pressure.

3. She has thrombocytopenia, which is likely multifactorial from poor production (ESLD), medication effects (especially Zosyn & famotidine), and possible consumption/DIC. Steroid trial is being given for possible ITP or AIHA.

4. The patient experienced hypotension, possibly due to septic shock, with various potential sources including MSSA bacteremia, E. coli UTI, pan-colitis, and dental abscess. All culture data are negative at Hospital1.

5. The patient had fever, which has resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH. Possible sources of infection include aspiration during dialysis line placement or transient bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line.

6. The patient has renal failure, likely ATN in the setting of shock. She has persistent anuria/oliguria, and renal assistance is appreciated.

   Assessment and Plan
   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA.
   -- cont solumedrole IV for ITP; ? slight improvement in plt count
   -- f/u add
l heme recs
   -- daily DIC panel (fibrinogen > 100 on [**12-21**], will defer cryo
   transfusion for today)
   -- would not transfuse additional platelets yet, only if evidence of
   worsening bleeding
   -- monitor med list for contributors (off zosyn, only except antibitics
   is flagyl; H2 blocker changed to PPI)
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol, including calcium
   # Hypotension: Had septic shock, whose etiology could have included
   prior infections including MSSA bacteremia (OSH culture grew [**11-21**], day
   1 treatment [**11-23**]), E coli UTI (cx grew [**11-21**]), pan-colitis (completing
   a course of flagyl) and dental abscess. All culture data negative at
   [**Hospital1 19**].
   -- completed flagyl course x 14 days to cover colitis (started [**12-7**]-
   [**12-20**])
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
   -- will try to run even to negative as BP tolerates
   # Fever: Resolved, but can be hypothermic on CVVH.  Concern that she
   aspirated [**12-10**] during dialysis line placement or had transient
   bacteremia from pulling the old femoral HD line. Other possible source
   may be either pancolitis versus dental abscesses. Also, have not
   pursued TEE after her positive blood cultures, although TTE was
   negative.  Other sources ruled out: SBP (neg diagnostic para [**2123-12-3**]).
   Lines: CVL changed [**2123-12-3**], a-line pulled [**2123-12-6**] (replaced [**12-7**] and again
   [**12-8**]), and femoral HD line changed [**2123-12-10**]. Sinusists: neg CT. Acalculous
   cholecystits: negative [**Name (NI) 3234**] sono.  Dental c/s could not assess her well
   w/o panorex, recommend removing necrotic teeth by oral-facial maxillary
   surgery; currently too clinically unstable.  Vanzo/zysyn stopped on
   [**12-14**] with no subsequent fevers and stable WBC.
   -- completed course flagyl empirically for presumed C diff
   -- all cultures have NGTD
   # Renal failure: Likely ATN in setting of shock.  Persistent anuria/
   oliguria. Appreciate renal assistance. Now off pressors, tolerating
   some volume removal by CVVH.
   -- ask renal about giving CVVH holiday and possibly attempting HD today
   or tomorrow
   -- lytes per CVVH protocol
   -- hope of renal recovery is slim/none
   -- family meeting held on [**12-17**] to discuss grave prognosis
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**]. Will likely be slow to recover however
   given toxic/metabolic derangements, HE, ICU delirium, ?
   schizophrenia/psychosis.  Will defer neuro imaging.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy; will increase
   rifaximin dose from 200 mg to 400 mg
   -- speech and swallow eval as MS slightly improved and pt tolerated ice
   chips [**12-20**]
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in low to mid-20 over last few days.

   # Alcoholic Hepatitis: U/S w/evidence of cirrhosis, portal vein
   thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies negative from [**2123-11-24**].
   Tylenol level negative at OSH. [**Doctor First Name **], anti-mitochondrial ab, Sm ab, RNP
   ab negative at OSH negative.  TBili slowly improving though no

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF and intubated on pressors. She is now extubated but still dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialfiltration (CVVH) and off pressors, tolerating low blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to poor production in end-stage liver disease, medication effects (especially Zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A hematology consult has been requested, and a steroid trial is being considered for possible immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is still low, and she is on midodrine. CVVH is being held to try to raise her volume balance and attempt hemodialysis (HD).

3. Fever: The patient had a low-grade temperature overnight, and leukocytosis is likely from solu-medrol, although a brewing infection is also possible. Additional white blood cell (WBC) counts will be added, and the situation will be monitored"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 45-year-old male with ESLD admitted for acute alcoholic hepatitis.
- The patient's course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia.
- Thrombocytopenia is likely multifactorial and the patient is currently on steroids for concern of autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Platelets are trending up today.
- Renal failure remains anuric. BP's are marginal today after a negative fluid balance yesterday. CVVH is on hold for now.
- Leukocytosis is possibly related to steroids but also had a low-grade temperature overnight. Culture spikes indicate a high risk for fungal sepsis.
- Hypotension is being monitored to determine if/when the patient can tolerate an HD trial.
- Cirrhosis management includes continuing lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy and cipro for SBP prophylaxis.
- Pulmonary status has improved but the patient still has an increased risk of aspiration.
- FEN: If the patient tolerates feeding, the NGT will be removed.
- GOC: Ongoing discussions with the family will continue.
- ICU care includes nutrition repletion, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and various lines and catheters in place.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. She was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status and later transferred to another hospital due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient has been extubated since December 4th and is still dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). She tolerates low blood pressure without any fluid removal during hemodialysis. 

The patient has multiple medical complications, including thrombocytopenia, hypotension, fever, renal failure, mental status changes, anemia, and alcoholic hepatitis. She has been receiving various treatments and medications to manage these conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding. A hematology consult has been requested, and steroid therapy is being continued to improve platelet count.
2. Hypotension: The patient remains on midodrine to improve blood pressure. It is important to monitor her response to the medication and continue to optimize her fluid balance.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has resolved despite being on steroids. Monitoring for any signs of infection or other causes of fever is necessary.
4. Renal failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and dependent on CVVH. Efforts are being made to remove"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted to the hospital for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to [Hospital1] with shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient was intubated and put on pressors but is now extubated and off pressors, tolerating low blood pressure. She is dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has shown improvement each day.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has low platelet count, which is likely multifactorial due to poor production (end-stage liver disease), medication effects (especially Zosyn and famotidine), and possibly consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A heme consult has been requested, and a steroid trial is being considered for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The patient's condition is improving slightly each day, so the plan is to continue the current treatment.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been improving, but she remains on midodrine. The plan is to continue midodrine and try to tolerate mean arterial pressures (MAPS) greater than 50. CVVH is being held to work towards tolerating hemodial"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, blood pressure of 89/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation but not on supplemental oxygen. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, indicating low fluid volume.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.9 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST: 146/203), elevated bilirubin levels, and abnormal coagulation parameters (PT/PTT/INR: 27.3/49.5/2.7). The platelet count is low at 13 K/uL. Renal function tests indicate anemia (Hct: 21.7%) and worsening renal failure (creatinine: 1.8 mg/dL).

The patient's medical complications include thrombocytopenia, renal failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, cirrhosis, pulmonary issues, and feeding tube-related"

","The patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is being treated with methylprednisolone for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The platelet count is trending up today, so the plan is to continue methylprednisolone for now and reserve platelet transfusion for vigorous bleeding. When the platelet count is above 50k, the patient will transition to prednisone.
2. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric and tolerated hemodialysis (HD) yesterday although no volume was removed. The plan for tomorrow is to attempt HD with small volume removal.
3. Leukocytosis: This may be related to steroids but also had a low-grade temperature two nights ago. The plan is to continue monitoring and culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient tolerated HD yesterday. The plan is to continue midodrine.
5. Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy. The patient is on ciprofloxacin for spontaneous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis who was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She has been transferred to the ICU where she was intubated and placed on pressors. She is now extubated but still dependent on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH). Her thrombocytopenia is multifactorial and may be due to poor production (ESLD), medication effects, and possible consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A steroid trial is being given for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The patient's hypotension has improved but she remains on midodrine. She has no further fever despite being on solu-medrol and off antibiotics. Her renal failure is anuric and she is holding CVVH in an attempt to raise volume balance and attempt hemodialysis (HD). She tolerated HD on 12/22 without any volume removal. Mental status is improving slowly, tolerating diet without difficulty, and hepatic encephalopathy is being managed with lactulose and rifaximin. Anemia is stable and being managed with epogen and transfusions. The patient has alcoholic hepatitis with evidence of cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus. Prognosis is grave. The patient requires ongoing ICU care and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis. She was admitted for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to the ICU where she developed shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient was intubated on pressors but is now extubated and still dependent on CVVH. She has been off pressors but tolerates low blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which can be due to poor production caused by end-stage liver disease (ESLD), medication effects (especially zosyn and famotidine), or possible consumption/disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). A heme consult has been requested, and a steroid trial has been initiated for possible immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The plan is to monitor the platelet count and adjust the treatment accordingly.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been improved but remains low. She is still on midodrine, and it has been tolerated during hemodialysis without volume removal. The goal is to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAPS) above 50, and the maximum dose of midodrine (10 mg TID) is being given.

3. Fever: The patient no longer has a fever,"

   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Will change steroids to prednisone 60mg daily today and taper ( ?
   steroids contributing to delirium)
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Tolerated HD Wednesday although no
   volume removed.
     -Plan for HD attempt today with voume removal.
    Leukocytosis:  Possibly related to steroids but also had a low grade
   temp 3 nights ago.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
     -Check CXR today
     -CVC now out, will try to have IR guided PICC placed today.
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -Continue midodrine. PICC line today for pressor need with HD
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved from Friday but still at overall increased
   risk of aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
     -CXR does not features of PNA or atelectasis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has developed thrombocytopenia, which is likely multifactorial. The patient is currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia. The platelet count continues to trend up today.

2. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric (no urine output) and has required hemodialysis (HD) due to acute renal failure. The patient tolerated HD on Wednesday, although no volume was removed. A plan for HD attempt today with volume removal is mentioned.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be related to steroids but also had a low-grade temperature three nights ago. The patient's white blood cell count will be monitored, and cultures may be obtained if there is a significant increase.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been variable, but it is currently the best it has been today. The patient will continue on midodrine, which helps improve vascular tone and blood pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for acute hepatic failure and altered mental status. She was transferred to another hospital and intubated due to shock, ARDS, and ARF. The patient is now extubated but still dependent on CVVH and off pressors. She tolerates low blood pressure and has thrombocytopenia, which is likely multifactorial from poor production in ESLD, medication effects, and possibly consumption/DIC. Steroid therapy is being considered for possible ITP or AIHA.

The patient's condition has been improving slowly. She has been extubated, off pressors, and tolerating low blood pressure. Her renal failure remains anuric, and CVVH is being held to raise volume balance and attempt HD. The patient is also being treated for hepatic encephalopathy, schizophrenia/psychosis, and anemia. She has evidence of alcoholic hepatitis with cirrhosis and portal vein thrombus (non-occlusive). Hepatitis serologies have been negative, and the patient's prognosis is grave.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count could lead to increased risk of bleeding and difficulty in clotting.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, and she may require further management to maintain adequate blood flow"

   45 year old female with EtOH hepatitis/cirrhosis admitted to OSH for
   acute hepatic failure and altered mental status transferred to [**Hospital1 19**]
   with shock, ARDS and ARF, intubated on pressors. Now extubated since
   [**2123-12-4**], but still CVVH dependent, off pressors, tolerating low BP.
   # Thrombocytopenia: appreciate heme consult, likely multifactorial from
   poor production [**1-3**] ESLD, med effect (esp zosyn & famotidine), and
   possibily consumption/DIC.  Steroid trial is for possible ITP or AIHA;
   plt count has been improving on steroids.  No evidence of bleeding.
   -- hepatic dysfunction not correctable
   -- changed solumedrol to prednisone 60 mg QD on [**12-24**]; slow taper over
   weeks
   -- heme still following; no new recs
   # Hypotension: has been improved; remains on midodrine; tolerated HD
   w/o vol removal [**12-22**].  Will attempt HD again today with volume removal.
   -- tolerate MAPS > 50
   -- remains on midodrine 10 mg TID (maxing out dose)
 may try to taper
   later in week pending she tolerates HD hemodynamically.
   # Fever: no further fever, despite being on steroids and off
   antibiotics.
   -- cont to follow; no need for empiric abx currently as no evidence of
   infection
   # Renal failure: still anuric; tolerated HD w/o vol removal [**12-22**].  Will
   attempt HD again today with volume removal.
   -- getting epo at HD; starting renagel today per renal recs
   -- has temp HD line that was placed on [**12-10**]; will need to plan for
   tunneled catheter placement by IR
   # Mental Status: waxing/[**Doctor Last Name 533**], perseveration; but overall improving
   daily. Will likely be slow to recover however given toxic/metabolic
   derangements, HE, ICU delirium.
   --  lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy
   # Anemia: stable.  Has been stable in mid-20 over last few days. +
   Direct coomb

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old female with a history of alcohol use disorder, presenting with acute hepatic failure, altered mental status, shock, ARDS, and ARF. She has been admitted to the ICU, intubated, and placed on pressors. The patient is currently extubated and still dependent on CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis). She is also on midodrine for hypotension and prednisone for possible immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The patient has been diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with portal vein thrombus. Her hepatic dysfunction is not correctable, and she has stable anemia. She is receiving lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, epo for anemia, and renal recommendations including the use of renagel.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. The cause of thrombocytopenia is likely multifactorial, including ESLD (end-stage liver disease), medication effects, and possibly disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Steroids have been given to improve platelet count, and there is no evidence of bleeding at present.
2. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, for"

   Assessment and Plan
   45yo with ESLD initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis.
   Course has been complicated by ARF requiring CVVH, respiratory failure
   requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia
   Thrombocytopenia:   As previously described, likely multifactorial.
   Currently on steroids for concern for autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
   Platelets continue to trend up today.
     -Continue prednisone at 60mg for now, with plans to taper over the
   next several weeks.
    Renal Failure:  Remains anuric.  Currently getting HD with volume
   removal and has tolerated from BP standpoint.
     -Continue epogen.  Start renagel
     -Will plan for tunnelled line next week
    Leukocytosis:   Improved today.  Likely from steroids.
     -Continue to monitor
     -Culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis
    Hypotension: BP the best it has been today.
     -If continues to tolerate HD, could consider weaning midodrine in the
   future.
    Cirrhosis:  Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy.  On cipro
   for SBP prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent
   disorientation
    Pulm:  Status much improved but still at overall increased risk of
   aspiration.
     -Continue Pulmonary toilet
    FEN:  Regular diet
   Dispo:  If tolerates HD with fluid removal, will consider floor
   transfer today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) initially admitted with acute alcoholic hepatitis. The patient's course has been complicated by acute renal failure requiring continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH), respiratory failure requiring intubation, and now thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently receiving steroids for concern of autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and his platelet count is trending up.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Thrombocytopenia: Continue prednisone at 60mg for now, with plans to taper over the next several weeks.
2. Renal Failure: The patient remains anuric and is receiving hemodialysis (HD) with volume removal. He has tolerated HD from a blood pressure standpoint. Continue epogen and start renagel. Plan for a tunneled line next week.
3. Leukocytosis: Improved today, likely due to steroids. Continue to monitor and culture if spikes. High risk for fungal sepsis.
4. Hypotension: BP the best it has been today. If continues to tolerate HD, consider weaning midodrine in the future.
5. Cirrhosis: Continue lactulose/rifaximin for encephalopathy. On cipro for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) prophylaxis. Mental status better but still intermittent disorientation.
