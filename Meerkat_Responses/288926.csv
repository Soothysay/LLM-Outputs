   Assessment and Plan
   Impression/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD,
   prostate CA, with septic shock, cardiac ischemia and hypoxic
   respiratory failure, .
   # Septic shock: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include pneumonia with vomiting. LLL infiltrate on CT, ?RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Also U/A is consistent with infection, so urine is
   another source. Given vomiting and PEG dysfunction consider abdominal
   pathology though patient is current without abdominal pain and
   lft's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip mostly normal which is reassuring.  After discussion with
   his son and patient he would consider intubation if exclusively a
   pulmonary failure and other organs were functioning normally however he
   does have evidence of end-organ hypoperfusion with cardiac ischemia and
   mild renal dysfunction.
   - volume resuscitation for CVP 8-12 (corrected for PEEP)
   - antibiotics empirically for HAP/uti: vanco, zosyn, cipro
   - monitor uop, lactate (trending down), renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u urine legionella ag, blood cx, urine cx
   - foley to monitor uop
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Aspiration pna vs. pulmonary edema in
   chf (less likely by imaging) vs. capillary leak in septic shock.
   Improved with NIPPV though this is not likely to be a good long-term
   solution if pneumonia. Family would consider intubation if pure
   respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - abg, then rest from mask ventilation, resume if worse
   - try to optimize respiratory status by decompressing abdomen by
   suctioning out PEG tube if possible
   - albuterol nebs prn
   - antibiotics as above
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.
   - optimize hemodynamics with ivf, sepsis treatment as above
   - monitor CE's and ECG until trop trending down
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - statin
   - TTE in am
   - PPV helps with preload/afterload reduction
   # Tachycardia: Appears to be sinus arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele, ivf to help with rate, ecg in am
   # HONK: History of diabetes, likely exacerbated control given
   infection/stress, no ketones on UA but elevated AG so may lag behind.
   - insulin gtt per protocol for glycemic control
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for
   metastatic lesion (at least one possible spinous lesion on CT
   abd/pelvis, await final read), also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - check psa, pth
   - aggressive ivf resuscitation
   - check iCa
   # Abdominal pain: Unclear if related to ischemia with relative
   hypoperfusion vs. distension from PPV. LFT's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip relatively normal
   and reassuring. Gas in rectum so unlikely to have ileus/sbo. Also given
   copious peg tube discharge ? necrosis there or fistula?
   - monitor PEG tube discharge, GI aware, consider surgical eval
   - serial abdominal exams
   - attempt decompression via PEG tube
   # PEG tube site discharge: Copious dark red fluid draining about PEG
   tube (appears to be from track as lavage via PEG tube is not grossly
   bloody-just bilious).
   - GI aware, recommended surgical evaluation to r/o buried bumper
   syndrome
   - surgery repositioned tube and sutured, following
   # Anion gap: Improving with hydration and insulin, suspect secondary to
   lactate. Monitor.
   # FEN: Hold tube feeds for now but place nutrtion consult for recs and
   start in am if more stable. Replete lytes.
   # PPx: Heparin sc, bowel regimen, insulin gtt, cont. H2 blocker.
   # Acccess: Right femoral CVC, consider trying for left IJ in am.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.
   # Communication: Patient, son [**Name (NI) 1412**] (c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1662**], (h) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1663**],
   (other c) [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1664**].

   Code status: DNR / DNI
   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate cancer, and septic shock. He has hypoxic respiratory failure, acute myocardial ischemia, tachycardia, hypercalcemia, abdominal pain, and PEG tube site discharge. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has septic shock, which indicates a severe infection. This can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in septicemia or sepsis-induced hypotension.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) if not managed appropriately.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has evidence of acute myocardial ischemia, which can lead to a heart attack or other cardiac complications if not treated promptly.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient has hypercalcemia, which can cause renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological symptoms if not managed properly.
5. Abdominal Pathology: The patient's abdominal pain and PEG tube site discharge raise concerns about possible abdominal pathology, such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
6. Pneumonia: The patient has a lower lobe infiltrate on CT, suggesting the possibility of pneumonia, which can worsen his respiratory status and overall prognosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   Impression/Plan: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD,
   prostate CA, with septic shock, cardiac ischemia and hypoxic
   respiratory failure, .
   # Septic shock: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include pneumonia with vomitting and LLL infiltrate, also urine
   appears infected as another source. Given vomitting and abdominal pain
   consider abdominal pathology though CT and lft's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip relatively
   normal which is reassuring. After discussion with his son and himself
   he would consider intubation if exclusively a pulmonary failure and
   other organs were functioning normally however he does have evidence of
   end-organ hypoperfusion with cardiac ischemia and mild renal
   dysfunction.
   - volume resuscitation for CVP 8-12 (corrected for PEEP)
   - antibiotics empirically for HAP/uti: vanco, zosyn, cipro
   - given low cvo2 would likely benefit from dobutamine but will discuss
   with family as may increase myocardial oxygen demand (hct above 30 so
   likely would not benefit from transfusion though this will likely drop
   after volume resuscitation)
   - monitor lactate, renal function, mental status
   - consider a.line
   - check urine legionella ag, blood cx, urine cx, try for sputum gram
   stain and culture
   - foley to monitor uop
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Aspiration pna vs. pulmonary edema in
   chf (less likely by imaging) vs. capillary leak in septic shock.
   Improved with NIPPV though this is not likely to be a good long-term
   solution if pneumonia. Family would consider intubation if pure
   respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - abg, then rest from mask ventilation, resume if worse
   - try to optimize respiratory status by decompressing abdomen by
   suctioning out PEG tube if possible
   - albuterol nebs prn
   - antibiotics as above
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.
   - optimize hemodynamics with ivf, sepsis treatment as above
   - monitor CE's and ECG until trop trending down
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - statin
   - TTE in am
   - PPV helps with preload/afterload reduction
   # Tachycardia: Appears to be sinus arrhythmia.
   - monitor on tele, ivf to help with rate, ecg in am
   # HONK: History of diabetes, likely exacerbated control given
   infection/stress, no ketones on UA but elevated AG so may lag behind.
   - insulin gtt per protocol for glycemic control
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Hypercalcemia: Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for
   metastatic lesion (at least one possible spinous lesion on CT
   abd/pelvis, await final read), also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - check psa, pth
   - aggressive ivf resuscitation
   - check iCa
   # Abdominal pain: Unclear if related to ischemia with relative
   hypoperfusion vs. distension from PPV. LFT's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip relatively normal
   and reassuring. Gas in rectum so unlikely to have ileus/sbo. Also given
   copious peg tube discharge ? necrosis there or fistula?
   - monitor PEG tube discharge, GI aware, consider surgical eval
   - serial abdominal exams
   - attempt decompression via PEG tube
   # PEG tube site discharge: Copious dark red fluid draining about PEG
   tube (appears to be from track as lavage via PEG tube is not grossly
   bloody-just bilious).
   - GI aware, recommended surgical evaluation to r/o buried bumper
   syndrome
   - surgery repositioned tube and sutured, following
   # Anion gap: Improving with hydration and insulin, suspect secondary to
   lactate. Monitor.
   # FEN: Hold tube feeds for now but place nutrtion consult for recs and
   start in am if more stable. Replete lytes.
   # PPx: Heparin sc, bowel regimen, insulin gtt, cont. H2 blocker.
   # Acccess: Right femoral CVC, consider trying for left IJ in am.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-inch tall male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing a high heart rate (105 bpm), low blood pressure (122/60 mmHg), and low oxygen saturation (99%). The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been started on multi-lumen infusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that could arise. These include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial admission to the ICU was due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if the non-invasive ventilation is not effective or if the patient develops ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Sepsis: The patient's high heart rate, low blood pressure, and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of sepsis. This is further supported by the administration of antibiotics and the presence of blood cultures. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be life-threatening.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing blood clots, such as DVT. The patient's peripheral vascular examination is not assessed, which may indicate an increased risk of DVT.

4. Stress Ulcer: Critically ill patients, especially those receiving mechanical ventilation, are at an increased risk of developing stress ulcers. Prophylactic measures should be"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate cancer, septic shock, cardiac ischemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure.
- He was admitted to the ICU with suspected pneumonia and aspiration, for which he was placed on non-rebreather ventilation.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 37.7°C (99.8°F), HR: 105 bpm, BP: 122/60 mmHg, RR: 31 breaths/min, SpO2: 99%.
- His physical examination revealed tachypnea, breath sounds present bilaterally but decreased on the left, diffuse expiratory rhonchi, and trace edema on the left.
- Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, mild anemia, elevated troponin levels, and hyperglycemia.
- Imaging studies indicate LLL pneumonia or aspiration with associated left pleural effusion, and possible RLL infiltrate on CXR.
- The patient's medical conditions include septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute myocardial ischemia, hypercalcemia, PEG tube site discharge, hypokalemia, and FEN (fistula-related issues).
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, with the exception of a trial intubation if the decline is slow and not tolerating NIPPV.
- The patient has multiple IV lines, including a femoral CVC and PIV x 2 (20 gauge), with a request for a PICC line to allow for the removal of the femoral line.
- Nutrition consult and insulin gtt have been ordered.
- The patient's family has been informed and is involved in decision-making.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest the possibility of pneumonia, which can progress to severe respiratory failure and sepsis.
2. Aspiration: Given the patient's dysphagia and decreased protective airway reflexes, there is a risk of aspiration leading to further lung infection and respiratory compromise.
3. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's known history of CAD and elevated troponin levels indicate ongoing myocardial ischemia, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, or even myocardial infarction.
4. Sepsis: The patient's current septic shock state may worsen if the underlying infection is not adequately controlled, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially death.
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient's elevated calcium levels require monitoring and management to prevent complications such as renal dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels need"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, prostate cancer, and septic shock.
- He is currently on non-rebreather ventilation with good oxygen saturation.
- The patient has pneumonia with associated left pleural effusion, as seen on the chest X-ray.
- His urine analysis shows signs of infection, suggesting another potential source of infection.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes are trending down, indicating improvement in myocardial ischemia.
- He has hypercalcemia with an unclear etiology, possibly related to prostate cancer or hyperparathyroidism.
- The patient's PEG tube site discharge has resolved after surgery relieved pyloric obstruction caused by the tube.
- He is hypokalemic and will need to maintain K+ levels above 4.
- The patient has a DNR/DNI code status, with the exception of a trial intubation if he is not tolerating NIPPV and declining slowly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests ongoing sepsis due to pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and possibly gastrointestinal infection. This may require continued aggressive treatment, including antibiotics and fluid resuscitation.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure needs close monitoring. If his respiratory status worsens, intubation and mechanical ventilation might be necessary.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: Although the cardiac enzymes are"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, with
   septic shock, cardiac ischemia and hypoxic respiratory failure, .
   # Septic shock: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include pneumonia with vomiting. LLL infiltrate on CT, ?RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, so urine is
   another source. Given vomiting and PEG dysfunction consider abdominal
   pathology though patient is current without abdominal pain and
   lft's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip mostly normal.
   - volume resuscitation for CVP 8-12 (corrected for PEEP)
   - antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn, cipro
   - monitor uop, lactate (trending down), renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u urine legionella ag, blood cx, urine cx
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Aspiration pna vs. pulmonary edema in
   CHF (less likely by imaging) vs. capillary leak in septic shock.
   Improved with NIPPV though this is not likely to be a good long-term
   solution if pneumonia. Family would consider intubation if pure
   respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.  Currently on
   non-rebreather with good sats.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Restart non-invasive ventilation PRN
   - albuterol nebs prn
   - antibiotics as above
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.
   - optimize hemodynamics with ivf, sepsis treatment as above
   - Troponin trending down.  Monitor one more set of enzymes.  Monitor
   ECG.
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - statin
   - f/u TTE
   - PPV helps with preload/afterload reduction, although will use
   respiratory status to guide use of non-invasive PPV.
   # HONK: History of diabetes, likely exacerbated control given
   infection/stress, no ketones on UA but elevated AG so may lag behind.
   - insulin gtt per protocol for glycemic control
   - attempt to change drip to SC insulin today
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, now high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesion (at least one possible spinous lesion on CT abd/pelvis, await
   final read), also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - check PTH
   - aggressive ivf resuscitation
   - follow iCa
   # PEG tube site discharge:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-blood fluid lavaged from
   tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery felt
   that the PEG was causing pyloric obstruction.  Surgery relieved the
   obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.
   Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor PEG sites
   - f/u surgery recs
   # Hypokalemia:  Will need to maintain K > 4 in the setting of patient
   myocardial ischemia.  Will need to be cautious with K+ administration
   if patient develops renal failure.
   -          repleted K+ this a.m.
   -          p.m. labs to check K
   # FEN: Hold tube feeds for now.  Nutrition consult. Replete lytes.
   # PPx: Heparin sc, bowel regimen, insulin gtt, cont. H2 blocker.
   # Access: Right femoral CVC.  PIV x 2 (20 gauge).  Request PICC to
   allow d/c of femoral line.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He presented with septic shock, cardiac ischemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He has been treated with volume resuscitation, antibiotics, and non-invasive ventilation. His troponin levels are improving, but he still requires close monitoring of his respiratory status and cardiac enzymes. The patient has also been managed for hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, and other medical complications. His code status is DNR/DNI, and the family is open to a trial intubation if his condition deteriorates slowly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already in septic shock, and there is a concern for ongoing infection as indicated by the presence of mixed bacterial flora in the urine culture. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary to detect any worsening of sepsis.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms consistent with aspiration pneumonia, including cough, decreased breath sounds on the left, and patchy consolidative changes on the CT scan. Antibiotics have been started empirically, but further evaluation with sputum culture and chest X-ray may be needed to guide therapy.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has evidence of myocardial ischemia due to decreased myocardial oxygen demand exceeding supply. Continuous monitoring of the ECG, cardiac enzymes (troponin), and hemodynamics is"

   # Septic shock: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include pneumonia with vomiting. LLL infiltrate on CT, ?RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, so urine is
   another source. Given vomiting and PEG dysfunction consider abdominal
   pathology though patient is current without abdominal pain and
   lft's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip mostly normal.
   - volume resuscitation for CVP 8-12 (corrected for PEEP)
   - antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn, cipro
   - monitor uop, lactate (trending down), renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u urine legionella ag, blood cx, urine cx
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Aspiration pna vs. pulmonary edema in
   CHF (less likely by imaging) vs. capillary leak in septic shock.
   Improved with NIPPV though this is not likely to be a good long-term
   solution if pneumonia. Family would consider intubation if pure
   respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.  Currently on
   non-rebreather with good sats.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Restart non-invasive ventilation PRN
   - albuterol nebs prn
   - antibiotics as above
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.
   - optimize hemodynamics with ivf, sepsis treatment as above
   - Troponin trending down.  Monitor one more set of enzymes.  Monitor
   ECG.
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - statin
   - f/u TTE
   - PPV helps with preload/afterload reduction, although will use
   respiratory status to guide use of non-invasive PPV.
   # HONK: History of diabetes, likely exacerbated control given
   infection/stress, no ketones on UA but elevated AG so may lag behind.
   - insulin gtt per protocol for glycemic control
   - attempt to change drip to SC insulin today
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, now high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesion (at least one possible spinous lesion on CT abd/pelvis, await
   final read), also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - check PTH
   - aggressive ivf resuscitation
   - follow iCa
   # PEG tube site discharge:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-blood fluid lavaged from

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, septic shock, cardiac ischemia, and hypoxic respiratory failure. He is currently in the ICU for septic shock, suspected pneumonia, and urinary tract infection. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 36.8°C, HR: 114 bpm, BP: 142/72 mmHg, RR: 34 breaths/min, SpO2: 90%. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, high blood urea nitrogen, elevated creatinine, and high troponin levels. Imaging studies reveal focal patchy consolidative changes at the left base, insufficiency compression deformity of L3, multiple bilateral renal cysts, and no focal intra-abdominal fluid collection. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, beta-blockers, and insulin. The plan includes volume resuscitation, monitoring of urine output, lactate levels, renal function, and mental status. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is being treated for various medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock due to suspected pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, lab results, and clinical symptoms is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pneumonia"

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, prostate cancer, and septic shock. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and suspected sepsis. The patient has been receiving volume resuscitation, antibiotics, and non-invasive ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 142/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of septic shock and ongoing infection sources such as pneumonia and urinary tract infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and organ function is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk of respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status, ABG analysis, and response to non-invasive ventilation or intubation will be crucial.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has known CAD and evidence of acute myocardial ischemia. Frequent monitoring of ECG, cardiac enzymes, and hemodynamic stability is necessary to manage this condition effectively.

   CT abdomen/pelvis [**8-11**]:
   1. No focal intra-abdominal fluid collection.
   2. Focal patchy consolidative changes at the left base may represent
   early pneumonia or aspiration.
   3. Insufficiency compression deformity of L3 of unkown chronicity.
   4. Multiple bilateral renal cysts.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting, aspiration, and evolving
   aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology given [**Age over 90 **]
   dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and labs/imaging
   reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has trended down.
   Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor uop, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have use NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Avoid NIPPV if possible
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 to relieve volume overload
   - d/c albuterol due to SVT
   - antibiotics as above
   # Afib with RVR
 Patient was tachycardic to 170s but was
   hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.
   -          Will not use standing beta blockade at this time due to risk
   of hypotension, but can use PRN if patient develops RVR.
   -          Check TSH
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - relieve volume overload with Lasix
   - monitor EKG
   - contact patient
s cardiologist/PCP to obtain old echo records
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - replete K (cautiously given risk of renal dysfunction in the setting
   of severe sepsis) with goal K > 4.0 to reduce risk of arrythmia
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 108-244
   during past 24 hours, with patient off insulin drip since yesterday
   afternoon.
   - monitor blood sugar
   - d/c insulin drip
   - tighten sliding scale
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, then high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesions.  Bony abnormality on abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also
   consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - repeat iCa on VBG
   # [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Age over 90 **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Age over 90 **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor [**Age over 90 **] site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - ask GI/surgery if it is okay to administer medications/tube feeds via
   tube
   # Anemia:  Hct 28.0, down from 32.0 yesterday, and 41.3 on admission.
   This could be from hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation and
   current fluid overload.  However, bleeding remains in differential,
   especially given problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] tube.
   -          p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # IV access problems:  [**Name2 (NI) **] femoral line infection risk.  PICC
   malpositioned.
   -          d/c femoral line
   -          reposition PICC (IR)
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dysphagia, coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and severe sepsis. The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the lungs. The patient's condition has been complex and challenging.

The patient's medical complications and potential medical complications include:
1. Severe sepsis: The patient presented with signs of systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected sources of infection such as aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). There is also a possibility of intra-abdominal pathology given the patient's vomiting and dysfunction of the feeding tube. Initial lactate levels were elevated, but have trended down. Blood culture results are pending.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis and/or pulmonary edema in congestive heart failure (CHF). Imaging shows vascular congestion and left lower lobe infiltrate, suggesting both processes are likely at play. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) was attempted but not well tolerated due to respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk. The patient is currently off NIPPV and maintaining adequate oxygenation.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around PEG.  PEG was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA, likely resulting in gastric outlet obstruction,
   with subsequent vomiting, aspiration, and evolving aspiration
   pneumonia/pneumonitis.
   # Septic shock: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include pneumonia with vomiting. LLL infiltrate on CT, ?RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, so urine is
   another source. Given vomiting and PEG dysfunction consider abdominal
   pathology though patient is current without abdominal pain and
   lft's/[**Doctor First Name **]/lip mostly normal.
   - volume resuscitation for CVP 8-12 (corrected for PEEP)
   - antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn, cipro
   - monitor uop, lactate (trending down), renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u urine legionella ag, blood cx, urine cx
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure: Aspiration pna vs. pulmonary edema in
   CHF (less likely by imaging) vs. capillary leak in septic shock.
   Improved with NIPPV though this is not likely to be a good long-term
   solution if pneumonia. Family would consider intubation if pure
   respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.  Currently on
   non-rebreather with good sats.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Restart non-invasive ventilation PRN
   - albuterol nebs prn
   - antibiotics as above
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.
   - optimize hemodynamics with ivf, sepsis treatment as above
   - Troponin trending down.  Monitor one more set of enzymes.  Monitor
   ECG.
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - statin

   - PPV helps with preload/afterload reduction, although will use
   respiratory status to guide use of non-invasive PPV.
   # HONK: History of diabetes, likely exacerbated control given
   infection/stress, no ketones on UA but elevated AG so may lag behind.
   - insulin gtt per protocol for glycemic control
   - attempt to change drip to SC insulin today
   - hold oral hypoglycemics
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, now high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesion (at least one possible spinous lesion on CT abd/pelvis, await
   final read), also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - check PTH
   - aggressive ivf resuscitation
   - follow iCa
   # PEG tube site discharge:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-blood fluid lavaged from
   tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery felt
   that the PEG was causing pyloric obstruction.  Surgery relieved the
   obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.
   Discharge now resolved.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the PEG. The patient had a malpositioned PICC line, underwent a trans-thoracic echo showing symmetric LVH with an ejection fraction of 35%, and an EKG indicating SVT (likely AFIB with RVR). He received various antibiotics and infusions, including metoprolol, heparin sodium, and ciprofloxacin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/72 to 156/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 90%. His physical examination revealed sluggish pupils, decreased breath sounds on the left side, irregular rhythm with quiet heart sounds, and trace edema on the right. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated troponin T levels, and hypercalcemia. The patient has an ongoing aspiration pneumonia, septic shock, hypoxic respiratory failure, and acute myocardial ischemia. His code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently being managed in the ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask
   - D/C NIPPV
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 to relieve volume overload.  Check p.m. lytes.
   - d/c albuterol due to SVT
   - antibiotics as above
   # Afib with RVR
 Patient was tachycardic to 170s but was
   hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.
   -          Will not use standing beta blockade at this time due to risk
   of hypotension, but can use PRN if patient develops RVR.
   -          Check TSH
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - relieve volume overload with Lasix
   - monitor EKG
   - contact patient
s cardiologist/PCP to obtain old echo records
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - replete K (cautiously given risk of renal dysfunction in the setting
   of severe sepsis) with goal K > 4.0 to reduce risk of arrythmia
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 108-244
   during past 24 hours, with patient off insulin drip since yesterday
   afternoon.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - d/c insulin drip
   - tighten sliding scale
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, then high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesions.  Bony abnormality on abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also
   consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - repeat iCa with VBG
   # [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Age over 90 **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Age over 90 **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor [**Age over 90 **] site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - ask GI/surgery if it is okay to administer medications/tube feeds via
   tube
   # Anemia:  Hct 28.0, down from 32.0 yesterday, and 41.3 on admission.
   This could be from hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation and
   current fluid overload.  However, bleeding remains in differential,
   especially given problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] tube.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the heart. The patient had a PICC line malpositioned and underwent a transesophageal echocardiogram, which showed mild symmetric LVH, focal wall motion abnormalities, increased LVEDP, PA systolic HTN, and mildly dilated ascending aorta.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/72 mmHg to 156/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90%. The patient's physical examination revealed sluggish pupils, decreased breath sounds on the left side, diffuse expiratory rhonchi throughout, an irregular rhythm, and hypoactive bowel sounds.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and he has negative urine and blood tests for Legionella antigen. Imaging studies revealed no focal intra-abdominal fluid collection, but there were patchy consolidative changes at the left base of the lungs.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask
   - D/C NIPPV
   - Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 to relieve volume overload.  Check p.m. lytes.
   - d/c albuterol due to SVT
   - antibiotics as above
   # Afib with RVR
 Patient was tachycardic to 170s but was
   hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.
   -          Will not use standing beta blockade at this time due to risk
   of hypotension, but can use PRN if patient develops RVR.
   -          Check TSH
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - relieve volume overload with Lasix
   - monitor EKG
   - contact patient
s cardiologist/PCP to obtain old echo records
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - replete K (cautiously given risk of renal dysfunction in the setting
   of severe sepsis) with goal K > 4.0 to reduce risk of arrythmia
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 108-244
   during past 24 hours, with patient off insulin drip since yesterday
   afternoon.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - d/c insulin drip
   - tighten sliding scale
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, then high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesions.  Bony abnormality on abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also
   consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - repeat iCa with VBG
   # [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Age over 90 **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Age over 90 **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor [**Age over 90 **] site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - ask GI/surgery if it is okay to administer medications/tube feeds via
   tube
   # Anemia:  Hct 28.0, down from 32.0 yesterday, and 41.3 on admission.
   Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  This could be from hemodilution given
   large fluid resuscitation and current fluid overload.  However,
   bleeding remains in differential, especially given problems with [**Name2 (NI) **]
   tube.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # IV access problems:  [**Name2 (NI) **] femoral line infection risk.  PICC
   malpositioned.
   -          d/c femoral line
   -          reposition PICC (IR)
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around his [**Age over 90 **]. The patient had his feeding tube dislodged and reinserted, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction and subsequent vomiting. He also developed evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including severe sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute myocardial ischemia, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction, anemia, IV access problems, and code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe Sepsis: The patient has shown signs of infection, including elevated white blood cell count, fever, and tachycardia. He also has a urinary tract infection and likely aspiration pneumonia. The patient is currently on appropriate antibiotics but requires ongoing monitoring and management of his sepsis.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, with low oxygen saturation and evidence of hypoxemia. He has been supported with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV), but this is not ideal due to respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk. Intubation may be considered"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx

   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.

   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dysphagia, coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, and severe sepsis. He was admitted to the MICU with cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around his tracheostomy tube. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Severe sepsis: The patient shows signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with suspected sources of infection including aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). Imaging and urinalysis are consistent with infection, although the urine culture may be contaminated. Antibiotics have been empirically started for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and UTI.

2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has developed aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia, which is likely contributing to his respiratory distress. There is also evidence of pulmonary edema in congestive heart failure (CHF) due to vascular congestion and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate on imaging. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been used but is not suitable due to respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and risk of aspiration. Intubation may be considered if there is pure respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.

3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient was tachycardic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the tube. The patient had gastric outlet obstruction due to tube dysfunction, which was relieved by pulling back on the tube. He also developed evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia likely due to aspiration. The patient's current medical conditions include severe sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, acute myocardial ischemia, hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, anemia, and IV access problems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic inflammation response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected sources of infection include aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infection (UTI). He is already receiving volume resuscitation and antibiotics empirically for hospital-acquired pneumonia/UTI.
2. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient has an aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis vs. pulmonary edema in congestive heart failure (CHF). Both processes are likely contributing to his respiratory failure. He has been using non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) but it is not effective due to respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk. The family is considering intubation if pure respiratory failure occurs without other organ dysfunction.
3. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR): The patient was tachycardic up to 170 beats per minute but was hemodynamically stable. The tachycardia responded well to beta-blockade, although the patient's blood pressure fell to the 80s, which resolved quickly. The patient will not use standing beta-blockade at this time due to the risk of hypotension, but can use PRN if the patient develops RVR.
4. Acute myocardial ischemia: The patient has suspected demand ischemia in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known coronary artery disease (CAD). Troponins have trended downward, and a transthoracic echo (TTE) showed focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old myocardial infarction (MI), although no old echo is available for comparison.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and likely exacerbated by infection/stress. Blood sugars were elevated to 500s-600s on admission, controlled with an insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS. Blood sugars during the past 24 hours have been stable, with the patient off the insulin drip since yesterday afternoon.
6. Hypercalcemia: The patient's ionized calcium was initially mildly elevated, then high normal. The etiology is unclear, given his history of prostate cancer concern for metastatic lesions. A bony abnormality on abdominal"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Received Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 to relieve volume overload.  Put out 420
   mL over 4 hours.
   - antibiotics as above
   # Afib with RVR
 Patient was tachycardic to 170s but was
   hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.
   -          Will not use standing beta blockade at this time due to risk
   of hypotension, but can use PRN if patient develops RVR.
   -          Check TSH
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - relieve volume overload with Lasix
   - monitor EKG
   - contact patient
s cardiologist/PCP to obtain old echo records
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - replete K (cautiously given risk of renal dysfunction in the setting
   of severe sepsis) with goal K > 4.0 to reduce risk of arrythmia
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received total
   - monitor blood sugars
   - d/c insulin drip
   - tighten sliding scale
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, then high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesions.  Bony abnormality on abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also
   consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - repeat iCa with VBG
   # [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Age over 90 **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Age over 90 **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor [**Age over 90 **] site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - ask GI/surgery if it is okay to administer medications/tube feeds via
   tube
   # Anemia:  Hct 28.0, down from 32.0 yesterday, and 41.3 on admission.
   Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  This could be from hemodilution given
   large fluid resuscitation and current fluid overload.  However,
   bleeding remains in differential, especially given problems with [**Name2 (NI) **]
   tube.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # IV access problems:  [**Name2 (NI) **] femoral line infection risk.  PICC
   malpositioned.
   -          d/c femoral line
   -          reposition PICC (IR)
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dysphagia, coronary artery disease (CAD), prostate cancer, severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the heart.
- The patient was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the heart. He had an arterial line placed and was given broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The patient's condition has been complicated by gastric outlet obstruction due to reinsertion of a feeding tube, evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia likely due to aspiration, and volume overload.
- He is currently volume overloaded and receiving Lasix to relieve this condition. He is also receiving supplemental oxygen via a face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated.
- The patient has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and acute myocardial ischemia. Troponin levels have trended down, indicating improvement.
- He has hyperglycemia, likely exacerbated by infection/stress, and is being controlled with an insulin drip and lantus. Blood sugars are currently within a controlled range.
- The patient's calcium levels are high normal, possibly due to prostate cancer or hyperparathyroidism.
- There is a concern for anemia, which could be due to hemodilution or bleeding."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, and PEG dysfunction.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis to
   15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with
   elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac
   ischemia.  This resolved with volume resuscitation.  Renal function
   stable.  Blood cultures pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination.  Repeat UC sent, although this may be low yield in the
   setting of broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   - f/u urine culture
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Avoiding NIPPV in the
   setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and
   aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family would consider intubation if
   pure respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   -diuresis as below
   # Volume overload:  Patient has distended jugular veins and vascular
   congestion on CXR, although this has improved since yesterday.  Gave
   Lasix 20 mg IV yesterday, with 400 cc diuresis.
   - Repeat Lasix today if blood pressure tolerates.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient was tachycardic to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently tachycardic
   to the 120s to 130s, and normotensive to mildly hypotensive.  Rhythm is
   ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. Afib.  TSH wnl.
   -          Metoprolol 2.5 mg Q4H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended down (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - monitor EKG
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the PEG was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A PEG tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all PEG feeds/meds for now
   - replace PEG (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing PEG, consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5
   units or 10 units), during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - continue ISS
   - increase lantus this evening pending today
s blood sugars and insulin
   requirements
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Cannot give free water via PEG at this time due to PEG
   dysfunction.  Patient currently receiving K Phos in D5W, which is a
   source of free water.  Will need to replete free water slowly due to
   concern about volume overload.
   -          D5W 500 mL at 50 cc/hour, to begin after K Phos repletion is
   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, with possible contribution of respiratory
   alkalosis and treatment of hyperglycemia.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - no further work-up at this time
   # Anemia:  Hct stable at 28.0 during past 24 hours, down from 41 on
   admission.  Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  The patient
s acute
   anemia is likely due to hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation
   and current fluid overload.  However, will continue to follow Hct
   closely given bleeding around PEG tube.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer.
- He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and PEG dysfunction.
- The patient had a PEG dislodgment and reinsertion, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction and subsequent vomiting.
- He developed pneumonia likely due to aspiration, as indicated by imaging and clinical exam.
- The patient's initial presentation included signs of severe sepsis, elevated lactate levels, and cardiac ischemia. These symptoms resolved with volume resuscitation.
- His renal function is stable, but blood cultures are pending, and there is suspicion of a urinary tract infection.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, possibly due to aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema in the setting of congestive heart failure (CHF).
- He has a history of tachycardia, which responded well to beta blockade but resulted in transient hypotension. The rhythm is currently ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. atrial fibrillation.
- There is a concern for acute myocardial ischemia due to myocardial demand exceeding delivery, especially considering the patient's known CAD.
- The patient's PEG tube dysfunction is ongoing, with bloody discharge around the tube. A PEG tube study showed contrast opacification of the"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  Family would
   consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ
   dysfunction.  Currently off NIPPV and satting well.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Received Lasix 20 mg IV x 1 to relieve volume overload.  Put out 420
   mL over 4 hours.
   - antibiotics as above
   # Afib with RVR
 Patient was tachycardic to 170s but was
   hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.
   -          Will not use standing beta blockade at this time due to risk
   of hypotension, but can use PRN if patient develops RVR.
   -          Check TSH
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended town (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - relieve volume overload with Lasix
   - monitor EKG
   - contact patient
s cardiologist/PCP to obtain old echo records
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   - replete K (cautiously given risk of renal dysfunction in the setting
   of severe sepsis) with goal K > 4.0 to reduce risk of arrythmia
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received total
   - monitor blood sugars
   - d/c insulin drip
   - tighten sliding scale
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca initially mildly elevated, then high
   normal.  Unclear etiology, given h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic
   lesions.  Bony abnormality on abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also
   consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - repeat iCa with VBG
   # [**Age over 90 **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Age over 90 **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Age over 90 **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  Discharge now resolved.
   - monitor [**Age over 90 **] site
   - f/u surgery recs
   - ask GI/surgery if it is okay to administer medications/tube feeds via
   tube
   # Anemia:  Hct 28.0, down from 32.0 yesterday, and 41.3 on admission.
   Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  This could be from hemodilution given
   large fluid resuscitation and current fluid overload.  However,

   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis to
   15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with
   elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac
   ischemia.  This resolved with volume resuscitation.  Renal function

   draining about [**Date Range **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Date Range **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A [**Date Range **] tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all [**Date Range **] feeds/meds for now
   - replace [**Date Range **] (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing [**Date Range **], consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5

   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, with possible contribution of respiratory
   alkalosis and treatment of hyperglycemia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and [**Age over 90**] dysfunction. He has been tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, normotensive to mildly hypotensive, and has shown improvement in cardiac ischemia with trended down troponins. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia, urinary tract infection, volume overload, tachycardia, acute myocardial ischemia, tube dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has clinical exam and imaging consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. He is being treated with antibiotics, and his fever has resolved. Monitoring respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG is important.
2. Urinary tract infection: Two urinalyses have been consistent with infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination. A repeat UC has been sent, and the patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics. Monitoring urine output and renal function is essential.
3. Volume overload: The patient has distended jugular veins and vascular congestion on CXR, which has improved since yesterday. Diuretics will"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, and [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction.  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis to
   15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with
   elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac
   ischemia.  This resolved with volume resuscitation.  Renal function
   stable.  Blood cultures pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination.  Repeat UC sent, although this may be low yield in the
   setting of broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   - f/u urine culture
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Avoiding NIPPV in the
   setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and
   aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family would consider intubation if
   pure respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   -diuresis as below
   # Volume overload:  Patient has distended jugular veins and vascular
   congestion on CXR, although this has improved since yesterday.  Gave
   Lasix 20 mg IV yesterday, with 400 cc diuresis.
   - Repeat Lasix today if blood pressure tolerates.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient was tachycardic to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently tachycardic
   to the 120s to 130s, and normotensive to mildly hypotensive.  Rhythm is
   ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. Afib.  TSH wnl.
   -          Metoprolol 2.5 mg Q4H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended down (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - monitor EKG
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   # [**Date Range **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Date Range **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Date Range **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A [**Date Range **] tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all [**Date Range **] feeds/meds for now
   - replace [**Date Range **] (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing [**Date Range **], consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5
   units or 10 units), during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - increase lantus this evening pending today
s blood sugars and insulin
   requirements
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Cannot give free water via [**Date Range **] at this time due to [**Date Range **]
   dysfunction.  Patient currently receiving K Phos in D5W, which is a
   source of free water.  Will need to replete free water slowly due to
   concern about volume overload.
   -          D5W 500 mL at 50 cc/hour, to begin after K Phos repletion is
   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, with possible contribution of respiratory
   alkalosis and treatment of hyperglycemia.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - no further work-up at this time
   # Anemia:  Hct stable at 28.0 during past 24 hours, down from 41 on
   admission.  Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  The patient
s acute
   anemia is likely due to hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation
   and current fluid overload.  However, will continue to follow Hct
   closely given bleeding around [**Date Range **] tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and [Age over 90] dysfunction. He had a central line infection that resulted in gastric outlet obstruction and subsequent vomiting. He also developed evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. The patient's tachycardia has been intermittent and responsive to beta-blockade. He has stable renal function but is experiencing hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and anemia. His blood glucose levels have been well-controlled with insulin. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's clinical exam and imaging show signs of left lower lobe pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. He has been placed on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for hospital-acquired pathogens, including MRSA.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, and [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction.  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis to
   15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with
   elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac
   ischemia.  This resolved with volume resuscitation.  Renal function
   stable.  Blood cultures pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination.  Repeat UC sent, although this may be low yield in the
   setting of broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   - f/u urine culture
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Avoiding NIPPV in the
   setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and
   aspiration risk.  Family would consider intubation if pure respiratory
   failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   -diuresis as below
   # Volume overload:  Patient has distended jugular veins and vascular
   congestion on CXR, although this has improved since yesterday.  Gave
   Lasix 20 mg IV yesterday, with 400 cc diuresis.
   - Repeat Lasix today if blood pressure tolerates.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient was tachycardic to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently tachycardic
   to the 120s to 130s, and normotensive to mildly hypotensive.  Rhythm is
   ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. Afib.  TSH wnl.
   -          Metoprolol 2.5 mg Q4H.
   -          Monitor heart rate and BP.
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended down (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - monitor EKG
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   # [**Date Range **] tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about [**Date Range **] tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the [**Date Range **] was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been some bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A [**Date Range **] tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all [**Date Range **] feeds/meds for now
   - replace [**Date Range **] (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing [**Date Range **], consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct
   # Hyperglycemia:  History of diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5
   units or 10 units), during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - increase lantus this evening pending today
s blood sugars and insulin
   requirements
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Cannot give free water via [**Date Range **] at this time due to [**Date Range **]
   dysfunction.  Patient currently receiving K Phos in D5W, which is a
   source of free water.  Will need to replete free water slowly due to
   concern about volume overload.
   -          D5W 500 mL at 50 cc/hour, to begin after K Phos repletion is
   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, respiratory alkalosis.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - no further work-up at this time
   # Anemia:  Hct stable at 28.0.  Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  This
   could be from hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation and current
   fluid overload.  However, bleeding remains in differential, especially
   given problems with [**Name2 (NI) **] tube.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction. The patient had a multi-lumen central line inserted and received various antibiotics for suspected infections. He was also started on IV fluids, including Lasix for volume overload. The patient's tachycardia was managed with beta-blockers, and he received aspirin, statin, and diuretics for cardiac ischemia. The patient experienced tube dysfunction, with initial dark red fluid drainage and subsequent bloody discharge. A tube study confirmed gastric outlet obstruction and subsequent contrast opacification of the stomach and proximal jejunum. The patient's hyperglycemia was managed with insulin. He also had hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, anemia, and IV access problems. The patient's code status was changed to DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU pending improvement.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via [**Age over 90 **], CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory
   failure, and drainage of fluid around [**Age over 90 **].  [**Age over 90 **] was dislodged and
   reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet
   obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving
   pneumonitis/pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.
   # Severe sepsis: SIRS criteria (WBC, RR, HR, fever) with suspected
   sources include aspiration pneumonia and/or UTI.  LLL infiltrate on CT
   and CXR.  U/A is consistent with infection, although culture shows
   contamination.  Also considered intra-abdominal pathology in Ddx given
   [**Age over 90 **] dysfunction and vomiting, although this seems resolved and
   labs/imaging reassuring.  Lactate initially elevated, though this has
   trended down.  Blood culture pending.  Legionella antigen negative.
   - Volume resuscitation: Currently volume overloaded.  Will give Lasix
   in low dose.
   - Antibiotics empirically for HAP/UTI: vanco, zosyn.  D/C Cipro.
   - monitor UOP, renal function (stable), mental
   status
   - f/u blood cx
   - repeat U/.A, UC, although culture may be low yield because patient is
   on antibiotics.
   # Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Have used NIPPV to support
   ventilation, although this is not a good option because of respiratory

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer admitted to the MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxic respiratory failure, and drainage of fluid around the tube. The patient had a multi-lumen central venous catheter inserted in the ED, PICC repositioned into the subclavian by the IV team, and a G-tube inserted. The patient is receiving nutrition recommendations, antibiotic therapy, and various medications for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has severe sepsis with suspected sources including aspiration pneumonia and/or urinary tract infection (UTI). There is a possibility of progression to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has a history of CAD and is showing signs of acute myocardial ischemia. This could lead to further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia and possible pulmonary edema in congestive heart failure (CHF). There is a risk of worsening respiratory status leading to the need for intubation.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has a history of diabetes and is currently hyperglycemic, which can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS).
5. Hypercalcemia: The patient has elevated calcium levels, which may be due to hyperparathyroidism or metastatic lesions from prostate cancer. This could lead to renal dysfunction or cardiac arrhythmias.
6. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hemoglobin level, which could be due to hemodilution from fluid resuscitation or ongoing bleeding.
7. IV Access Problems: The patient has had issues with IV access, including a femoral line infection risk and a malpositioned PICC line.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further assessment and evaluation by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and management of the patient's conditions."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.  PEG
   was dislodged and reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted
   in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and
   evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.
   # Pneumonia/severe sepsis:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with
   LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although
   leukocytosis to 15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe
   sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Renal function stable.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum
   antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well
   on face mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient was tachycardic to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently tachycardic
   to the 120s to 130s, and normotensive to mildly hypotensive.  Rhythm is
   ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. Afib.  TSH wnl.
   -          Metoprolol 2.5 mg Q4H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended down (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - monitor EKG
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the PEG was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A PEG tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all PEG feeds/meds for now
   - replace PEG (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing PEG, consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5
   units or 10 units), during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - continue ISS
   - increase lantus this evening pending today
s blood sugars and insulin
   requirements
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Cannot give free water via PEG at this time due to PEG
   dysfunction.  Patient currently receiving K Phos in D5W, which is a
   source of free water.  Will need to replete free water slowly due to
   concern about volume overload.
   -          D5W 500 mL at 50 cc/hour, to begin after K Phos repletion is
   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, with possible contribution of respiratory
   alkalosis and treatment of hyperglycemia.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - no further work-up at this time
   # Anemia:  Hct stable at 28.0 during past 24 hours, down from 41 on
   admission.  Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  The patient
s acute
   anemia is likely due to hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation
   and current fluid overload.  However, will continue to follow Hct
   closely given bleeding around PEG tube.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.  PEG
   was dislodged and reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted
   in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and
   evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.
   # Pneumonia/severe sepsis:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with
   LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although
   leukocytosis to 15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe
   sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Renal function stable.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum
   antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well
   on face mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 500 cc negative today.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient developed SVT to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to IV
   metoprolol.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently
   tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, with atrial tachycardia on the
   monitor.  B-blockade was not initiated on [**6-12**] due to concern about
   hypotension.  However, on [**6-13**], the patient was able to tolerate
   metoprolol, with improved rate control.  The etiology of the
   tachycardia is likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q6H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # NSTEMI: Suspect demand in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding
   delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG today [**6-14**] depressions in I
   and V3-V6.
   - monitor EKG
   - supplemental O2
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - Reconsidered anti-coagulation after seeing today
s EKG.  However,
   decided not to initiate anti-coagulation at this time due to risk of GI
   bleeding.
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Anemia:  Hct stable 26.6, down from 28.0 yesterday, and 41 on
   admission.  The etiology of patient
s anemia is likely a combination of
   hemodilution and bleeding from PEG site.  Will continue to follow Hct
   and vital signs closely for evidence of active bleeding.  Transfusion
   not indicated at this time.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - Given hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will tighten sliding
   scale and increase lantus to 15 units QHS.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Will replete free water via PEG.
   -          Free water flushes via PEG 200 mL Q4H.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 2.6.
   -          repleting with Neutraphos via PEG
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis. The patient's PEG was dislodged and reinserted two days post admission. It appears that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome. 

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/severe sepsis: The patient has clinical exam and imaging consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis persists. The patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia. Blood cultures are pending. Legionella urinary antigen is negative.
2. Urinary tract infection: Two urinalyses have been consistent with infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad-spectrum antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Contributing factors include aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF. The patient is saturating well on face mask. Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.  PEG
   was dislodged and reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted
   in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and
   evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.
   # Pneumonia/severe sepsis:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with
   LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although
   leukocytosis to 15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe
   sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Renal function stable.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.

   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum
   antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well
   on face mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 500 cc negative today.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient became tachycardic to
   170s but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to
   IV metoprolol.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently
   tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, with atrial tachycardia on the
   monitor.  B-blockade was not initiated on [**6-12**] due to concern about
   hypotension.  However, on [**6-13**], the patient was able to tolerate
   metoprolol, with improved rate control.  The etiology of the
   tachycardia is likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q6H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # NSTEMI: Suspect demand in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding
   delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed focal wall motion abnormalities
   that are likely from old MI, although no old echo is available for
   comparison.  EKG today [**6-14**] depressions in I and V3-V6.
   - monitor EKG
   - supplemental O2
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - Reconsidered anti-coagulation after seeing today
s EKG.  However,
   decided not to initiate anti-coagulation at this time due to risk of GI
   bleeding.
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of insulin glargine during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - Given hyperglycemia anad resumption of tube feeds will tighten
   sliding scale and increase glargine to 15 units QHS.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Will replete free water via PEG.
   -          Free water flushes via PEG 200 mL Q4H.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 2.6.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Anemia:  Hct stable 26.6, down from 28.0 yesterday, and 41 on
   admission.  The etiology of patient
s anemia is likely a combination of
   hemodilution and bleeding from PEG site.  Will continue to follow Hct
   and vital signs closely for evidence of active bleeding.  Transfusion
   not indicated at this time.

   Disposition:  MICU
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis. The patient's PEG tube was dislodged and reinserted two days prior to admission. This resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, vomiting, and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia. The patient also has tachycardia, NSTEMI, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and anemia.

Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia/severe sepsis: The patient has clinical exam and imaging consistent with left lower lobe pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis persists. The patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia. Renal function is stable, and blood cultures are pending.
2. Urinary tract infection: Two urinalyses have been consistent with infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad-spectrum antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
3. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Contributing factors include aspiration PNA/pneumon"

   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.

   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of insulin glargine during past 24 hours.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis. The patient had a dislodged PEG tube that was reinserted two days prior, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction, vomiting, and evolving pneumonia complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pneumonia/severe sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing left lower lobe pneumonia due to aspiration. He initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia. Renal function is stable, and blood cultures are pending. Legionella urinary antigen is negative.
   - Continue broad-spectrum antibiotics (vanco, zosyn).
   - Follow up blood cultures.
   - Monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, and mental status.

2. Urinary tract infection: Two urinalyses indicate infection, but the first urine culture suggested contamination, and the second culture, sent after initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics, was negative.
   - Continue antibiotics (vanco, zosyn) to cover for HAP.

3. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: Contributing factors include aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory
   failure, and PEG dysfunction.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although leukocytosis to
   15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe sepsis, with
   elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac
   ischemia.  This resolved with volume resuscitation.  Renal function
   stable.  Blood cultures pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination.  Repeat UC sent, although this may be low yield in the
   setting of broad spectrum antibiotics.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   - f/u urine culture
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs.
   pulmonary edema in CHF.  With vascular congestion and LLL infiltrate on
   imaging, both processes are likely at play.  Avoiding NIPPV in the
   setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and
   aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family would consider intubation if
   pure respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   -diuresis as below
   # Volume overload:  Patient has distended jugular veins and vascular
   congestion on CXR, although this has improved since yesterday.  Gave
   Lasix 20 mg IV yesterday, with 400 cc diuresis.
   - Repeat Lasix today if blood pressure tolerates.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient was tachycardic to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to beta
   blockade, although the patient
s SBP fell to 80s, which resolved
   quickly.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently tachycardic
   to the 120s to 130s, and normotensive to mildly hypotensive.  Rhythm is
   ectopic atrial tachycardia vs. Afib.  TSH wnl.
   -          Metoprolol 2.5 mg Q4H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # Acute myocardial ischemia: Suspect demand in the setting of
   myocardial demand exceeding delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have
   trended down (most recently 0.58, down from peak 1.72).  TTE showed
   focal wall motion abnormalities that are likely from old MI, although
   no old echo is available for comparison.
   - monitor EKG
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - no role for anticoagulation given etiology likely fixed lesion with
   demand>supply rather than acute plaque rupture
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery at the recommendation of GI.  Surgery
   felt that the PEG was causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  During the past 24 hours, there has been bloody
   discharge around the tube.  A PEG tube study yesterday showed contrast
   opacification of stomach and proximal jejunum.
   - holding all PEG feeds/meds for now
   - replace PEG (interventional radiology)
   - if bleeding persists after replacing PEG, consult surgery for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 200-275
   during past 24 hours.  Received 21 units regular insulin plus lantus (5
   units or 10 units), during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars
   - continue ISS
   - increase lantus this evening pending today
s blood sugars and insulin
   requirements
   - holding oral hypoglycemics that patient takes at home
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Cannot give free water via PEG at this time due to PEG
   dysfunction.  Patient currently receiving K Phos in D5W, which is a
   source of free water.  Will need to replete free water slowly due to
   concern about volume overload.
   -          D5W 500 mL at 50 cc/hour, to begin after K Phos repletion is
   complete.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 1.8.  Likely due to poor nutrition, GI losses
   due to tube dysfunction, with possible contribution of respiratory
   alkalosis and treatment of hyperglycemia.
   -          repleting with IV K Phos
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   - no further work-up at this time
   # Anemia:  Hct stable at 28.0 during past 24 hours, down from 41 on
   admission.  Iron 33, TIBC 291, Ferritin 267.  The patient
s acute
   anemia is likely due to hemodilution given large fluid resuscitation
   and current fluid overload.  However, will continue to follow Hct
   closely given bleeding around PEG tube.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient

","The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted to MICU with severe sepsis, cardiac ischemia, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and PEG dysfunction. The patient's current conditions include pneumonia likely due to aspiration, urinary tract infection, hypoxemic respiratory distress possibly due to aspiration PNA/pneumonitis vs. pulmonary edema in CHF, volume overload, tachycardia, acute myocardial ischemia, PEG tube dysfunction, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, and anemia.

The patient underwent an IR-guided PEG tube replacement with a larger size. The procedure was delayed due to hemodynamic instability and was done at 5:00 PM. The patient had a bowel movement, and diuresis was held for low blood pressures. Metoprolol was increased for SVT episodes. The patient slept poorly.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 35.3°C (95.6°F), HR: 96 bpm (77-131 bpm), BP: 116/65 mmHg (75-149/89-102 mmHg), RR: 18 breaths per minute (18-35 breaths per minute), SpO2: 100% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. The patient's physical examination findings include moist oral mucosa with copious secretions, vesicular breath sounds on the right with decreased breath sounds at the right base, diffuse expiratory rhonchi throughout the left lung field, tachycardia with an irregular rhythm (frequent PACs and PVCs on monitor), and skin breakdown on the left upper extremity (elbow and hand) with no evidence of infection.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 15.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL, sodium of 148 mg/dL, potassium of 4.1 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen of 36 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL, glucose of 200-275 mg/dL, and calcium of 9.4 mg/dL. The patient's imaging shows a focal wall motion abnormality on TTE, and the CXR indicates vascular congestion.

The patient's plan includes monitoring respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, and ABG, supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated, chest PT, antibiotics as above, diuresis as below, and avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk. The patient's DNR/DNI status has been discussed and documented.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress due to pneumonia or pulmonary edema, further deterioration of renal function, worsening electrolyte imbalances, persistent tachycardia, and ongoing bleeding from the PEG tube site."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.  PEG
   was dislodged and reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted
   in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and
   evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.
   # Pneumonia/severe sepsis:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with
   LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although
   leukocytosis to 15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe
   sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Renal function stable.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum
   antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well
   on face mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 500 cc negative today.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient developed SVT to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to IV
   metoprolol.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently
   tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, with atrial tachycardia on the
   monitor.  B-blockade was not initiated on [**6-12**] due to concern about
   hypotension.  However, on [**6-13**], the patient was able to tolerate
   metoprolol, with improved rate control.  The etiology of the
   tachycardia is likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q6H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # NSTEMI: Suspect demand in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding
   delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG today [**6-14**] depressions in I
   and V3-V6.
   - monitor EKG
   - supplemental O2
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - Reconsidered anti-coagulation after seeing today
s EKG.  However,
   decided not to initiate anti-coagulation at this time due to risk of GI
   bleeding.
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Anemia:  Hct stable 26.6, down from 28.0 yesterday, and 41 on
   admission.  The etiology of patient
s anemia is likely a combination of
   hemodilution and bleeding from PEG site.  Will continue to follow Hct
   and vital signs closely for evidence of active bleeding.  Transfusion
   not indicated at this time.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - Given hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will tighten sliding
   scale and increase lantus to 15 units QHS.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Will replete free water via PEG.
   -          Free water flushes via PEG 200 mL Q4H.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 2.6.
   -          repleting with Neutraphos via PEG
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 500 cc negative today.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient developed SVT to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to IV
   metoprolol.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently
   tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, with atrial tachycardia on the
   monitor.  B-blockade was not initiated on [**6-12**] due to concern about
   hypotension.  However, on [**6-13**], the patient was able to tolerate
   metoprolol, with improved rate control.  The etiology of the
   tachycardia is likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q6H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # NSTEMI: Suspect demand in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding
   delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG today [**6-14**] depressions in I
   and V3-V6.
   - monitor EKG
   - supplemental O2
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - Reconsidered anti-coagulation after seeing today
s EKG.  However,
   decided not to initiate anti-coagulation at this time due to risk of GI
   bleeding.
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Anemia:  Hct stable 26.6, down from 28.0 yesterday, and 41 on
   admission.  The etiology of patient
s anemia is likely a combination of
   hemodilution and bleeding from PEG site.  Will continue to follow Hct
   and vital signs closely for evidence of active bleeding.  Transfusion
   not indicated at this time.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - Given hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will tighten sliding
   scale and increase lantus to 15 units QHS.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Will replete free water via PEG.
   -          Free water flushes via PEG 200 mL Q4H.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, elevated lactate, and meeting criteria for severe sepsis. The patient has several medical complications including pneumonia, urinary tract infection, congestive heart failure, tachycardia, NSTEMI, PEG tube dysfunction, anemia, hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, hypophosphatemia, and hypercalcemia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and the family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other organ dysfunction occurs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a confirmed LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration. This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially septic shock.
2. Severe Sepsis Syndrome: The patient met criteria for severe sepsis with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia. Close monitoring and aggressive management are necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Urinary Tract Infection: Although the urine culture was negative, the patient's urinalysis suggests infection. It is important to monitor for any signs of systemic infection or worsening UTI symptoms.
4. Congestive Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of vascular congestion on CXR and distended jugular veins. Diure"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate, meeting criteria for severe sepsis.  PEG
   was dislodged and reinserted 2 days PTA.  It seems that this resulted
   in gastric outlet obstruction, with subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and
   evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis syndrome.
   # Pneumonia/severe sepsis:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with
   LLL pneumonia, likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, although
   leukocytosis to 15 persists.  Patient initially met criteria for severe
   sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Renal function stable.  Blood cultures
   pending.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   # ?Urinary tract infection:  Two urinalyses have been consistent with
   infection, although the first urine culture was suggestive of
   contamination, and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum
   antibiotics had been initiated, was negative.
   - abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA/pneumonitis and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well
   on face mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory
   secretions, history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI,
   although family would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure
   without other organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status with clinical exam, oximetry, ABG.
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as above
   - diuresis as below
   # Congestive heart failure:  Patient has distended jugular veins and
   vascular congestion on CXR, although this has improved since
   yesterday.  The patient was positive 500 mL yesterday despite diuresis
   with IV Lasix.
   - Diuresis with IV Lasix as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 500 cc negative today.
   # Tachycardia
 On the evening of [**6-11**], patient developed SVT to 170s
   but was hemodynamically stable.  The tachycardia responded well to IV
   metoprolol.  Since then, the patient has been intermittently
   tachycardic to the 120s to 130s, with atrial tachycardia on the
   monitor.  B-blockade was not initiated on [**6-12**] due to concern about
   hypotension.  However, on [**6-13**], the patient was able to tolerate
   metoprolol, with improved rate control.  The etiology of the
   tachycardia is likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO Q6H.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   # NSTEMI: Suspect demand in the setting of myocardial demand exceeding
   delivery with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG today [**6-14**] depressions in I
   and V3-V6.
   - monitor EKG
   - supplemental O2
   - aspirin 325mg daily
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   - Reconsidered anti-coagulation after seeing today
s EKG.  However,
   decided not to initiate anti-coagulation at this time due to risk of GI
   bleeding.
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - appreciate IR recommendations
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Check p.m. Hct in the setting of bleeding
   # Anemia:  Hct stable 26.6, down from 28.0 yesterday, and 41 on
   admission.  The etiology of patient
s anemia is likely a combination of
   hemodilution and bleeding from PEG site.  Will continue to follow Hct
   and vital signs closely for evidence of active bleeding.  Transfusion
   not indicated at this time.
   -          f/u p.m. hematocrit
   -          Guaiac stools
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to
   340s during past 24 hours.  Received 18 units of regular insulin plus
   10 units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - Given hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will tighten sliding
   scale and increase lantus to 15 units QHS.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   # Hypernatremia:  Na 148, stable from yesterday.  Free water deficit
   1.5-2 liters.  Will replete free water via PEG.
   -          Free water flushes via PEG 200 mL Q4H.
   -          Check p.m. lytes
   # Hypophosphatemia:  Phos 2.6.
   -          repleting with Neutraphos via PEG
   -          p.m. lytes
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, elevated lactate, and meeting criteria for severe sepsis. The patient had a dislodged and reinserted PEG tube, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction, vomiting, evolving pneumonitis/pneumonia, and severe sepsis syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, including fever, leukocytosis, and imaging findings, suggest the presence of pneumonia.
2. Sepsis: The patient's elevated lactate levels, signs of end-organ dysfunction (cardiac ischemia), and positive blood cultures indicate sepsis.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination, the second culture was negative.
4. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be due to aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema from congestive heart failure.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's distended jugular veins and vascular congestion on chest X-ray suggest CHF.
6. Tachycardia: The patient has been intermittently tachycardic, likely related to infection and recent cardiac ischemia.

   CXR:  Volume overload, worsened.  LLL infiltrate.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonia, complicated by
   severe sepsis and cardiac ischemia.  Infection improving.  Active
   issues include pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension,
   cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed.
   # Hypotension:  Patient developed transient hypotension to SBP mid to
   upper 70s yesterday evening [**8-15**] at around 11 p.m.  Urine output
   decreased to <30cc/hr for 2 hours, then picked up again.  DDx includes
   intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction,
   and beta-blockade.  Responsive to fluid + blood.  Decreased metoprolol
   to 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**], with holding parameters.  Currently normotensive.
   -          Consider untreated C. diff infection as explained below
   under
diarrhea
   -          Treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IVF.
   However, try to avoid volume overload, as this could compromise
   patient
s respiratory status.
   .
   # Volume overload:  Patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR
   and worsened rhonchi on exam.  The patient was positive 1755 mL
   yesterday.  Could not diurese yesterday due to low BP, but today, BP
   appears to leave room for cautious diuresis.
   -          Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV as blood pressure tolerates,
   with goal diuresis 1 L negative today.
   -          Check p.m. lytes.
   -          Give KCl 20 mg via PEG in setting of K 3.9 and anticipated
   drop in K with Lasix.
   .
   # Anemia:  Consider GI bleeding in the setting of slowly falling Hct,
   guaiac-positive stools, and recent dysfunction/manipulation of PEG
   tube.  Transfused 1 unit yesterday for Hct 23.6 with good response.
   -          Check p.m. hematocrit.
   -          Transfuse for Hct < 25.
   -          Maintain active type and screen.
   -          Change H2 blocker to IV PPI in the setting of possible
   active GI bleeding.
   -          Consider GI consult if Hct continue to fall.
   .
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.  Began tube feeds
   yesterday [**6-14**], but stopped feeds in the setting of hypotension.  Will
   restart feeds today despite concern about GI bleeding.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Evaluate possible GI bleeding as explained under
anemia
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  In the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, will need to
   r/o C. diff.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.
   -          Test for C. diff.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well on face
   mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions,
   history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family
   would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other
   organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as below
   - diuresis as above
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, with leukocytosis
   slightly improved today at 14.3.  Patient initially met criteria for
   severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination with upper respiratory
   secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 PND.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx x 3
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   .
   # ?UTI:  Three urinalyses have had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination,
   and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum antibiotics had been
   initiated, was negative.  A third urine culture was sent yesterday
   evening [**8-15**] in the setting of hypotension.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   -          f/u urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170, although well-controlled with metoprolol
   recently.  Will decrease dose of metoprolol given recent hypotension.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   .
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG [**6-14**] depressions in I and
   V3-V6.
   - supplemental O2
   - Hold ASA today due to concern about GI bleeding
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 141 to
   214 during past 24 hours.  Received 11 units of regular insulin plus 7
   units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - With hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will likely need to
   adjust lantus this evening.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate. The patient had a recent episode of hypotension to SBP in the mid-to-upper 70s, which responded to fluid and blood administration. He also has volume overload, as indicated by vascular congestion on CXR and worsened rhonchi on exam. The patient has anemia, likely due to GI bleeding, and requires further evaluation and management. He has a history of diarrhea with guaiac-positive stools and a positive MRSA screen. The patient is on contact precautions and is being treated for pneumonia and possible UTI with appropriate antibiotics. His respiratory status is improving, and he is currently on supplemental O2 via a face mask. The patient has a history of tachycardia and acute cardiac ischemia, for which he is receiving metoprolol and statin therapy. His blood sugars are under control with insulin therapy. The patient has hypercalcemia, which may be related to his history of prostate cancer. His code status is DNR/DNI, but the family would consider trial intubation if there is a slow decline in his condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old man with a history of stroke, dysphagia, coronary artery disease, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate. The patient had a transient episode of hypotension to a blood pressure in the mid-to-upper 70s, which responded to fluids and blood transfusion. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis, and cardiac ischemia, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has a positive MRSA screen and is on contact precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension, which could be due to intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or beta-blockade. It is important to monitor his blood pressure closely and treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IV fluids while avoiding volume overload.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR and worsened rhonchi on exam, indicating volume overload. Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV should be initiated as tolerated to achieve a goal diuresis of 1 L negative today, while monitoring electrolytes and renal function.
3. Anemia: The patient has a slowly falling Hct, guaiac-positive stools, and recent PEG dysfunction, which raises concerns for GI bleeding. He has"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonia, complicated by
   severe sepsis and cardiac ischemia.  Infection improving.  Active
   issues include pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension,
   cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed.
   # Hypotension:  Patient developed transient hypotension to SBP mid to
   upper 70s yesterday evening [**8-15**] at around 11 p.m.  Urine output
   decreased to <30cc/hr for 2 hours, then picked up again.  DDx includes
   intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction,
   and beta-blockade.  Responsive to fluid + blood.  Decreased metoprolol
   to 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**], with holding parameters.  Currently normotensive.
   -          Consider untreated C. diff infection as explained below
   under
diarrhea
   -          Treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IVF.
   However, try to avoid volume overload, as this could compromise
   patient
s respiratory status.
   .
   # Anemia:  Consider GI bleeding in the setting of slowly falling Hct,
   guaiac-positive stools, and recent dysfunction/manipulation of PEG
   tube.  Transfused 1 unit yesterday for Hct 23.6 with good response.
   -          Check p.m. hematocrit.
   -          Transfuse for Hct < 25.
   -          Maintain active type and screen.
   -          Consider GI consult if Hct continue to fall.
   .
   # Volume overload:  Patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR
   and worsened rhonchi on exam.  The patient was positive 1755 mL
   yesterday.  Could not diurese yesterday due to low BP, but today, BP
   appears to leave room for cautious diuresis.
   - Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 1 L negative today.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well on face
   mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions,
   history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family
   would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other

   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  In the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, will need to
   r/o C. diff.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.
   -          Test for C. diff.
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170, although well-controlled with metoprolol
   recently.  Will decrease dose of metoprolol given recent hypotension.

   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.  Began tube feeds
   yesterday [**6-14**], but stopped feeds in the setting of hypotension.  Will
   restart feeds today despite concern about GI bleeding.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Evaluate possible GI bleeding as explained under
anemia
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 140s to

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate. The patient has had multiple complications including pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed. The patient's condition is improving but still requires close monitoring and management of various medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has experienced transient hypotension to SBP mid to upper 70s. This could be due to intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or beta-blockade. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and respond promptly with fluids or blood transfusions if hypotension recurs. However, caution should be exercised to avoid volume overload, which could compromise the patient's respiratory status.

2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been slowly falling, indicating possible GI bleeding. This could be due to dysfunction or manipulation of the PEG tube. The patient has been transfused with 1 unit of blood and should be monitored closely for further blood loss. A GI consult may be necessary if the patient's hemoglobin continues to fall.

   Blood culture [**8-11**]:  PND
   MRSA screen: positive
   CXR:  Volume overload, worsened.  LLL infiltrate.
   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonia, complicated by
   severe sepsis and cardiac ischemia.  Infection improving.  Active
   issues include pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension,
   cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed.
   # Hypotension:  Patient developed transient hypotension to SBP mid to
   upper 70s yesterday evening [**8-15**] at around 11 p.m.  Urine output
   decreased to <30cc/hr for 2 hours, then picked up again.  DDx includes
   intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction,
   and beta-blockade.  Responsive to fluid + blood.  Decreased metoprolol
   to 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**], with holding parameters.  Currently normotensive.
   -          Consider untreated C. diff infection as explained below
   under
diarrhea
   -          Treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IVF.
   However, try to avoid volume overload, as this could compromise
   patient
s respiratory status.
   .
   # Volume overload:  Patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR
   and worsened rhonchi on exam.  The patient was positive 1755 mL
   yesterday.  Could not diurese yesterday due to low BP, but today, BP
   appears to leave room for cautious diuresis.
   - Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV as blood pressure tolerates, with goal
   diuresis 1 L negative today.
   - Check p.m. lytes.
   .
   # Anemia:  Consider GI bleeding in the setting of slowly falling Hct,
   guaiac-positive stools, and recent dysfunction/manipulation of PEG
   tube.  Transfused 1 unit yesterday for Hct 23.6 with good response.
   -          Check p.m. hematocrit.
   -          Transfuse for Hct < 25.
   -          Maintain active type and screen.
   -          Change H2 blocker to IV PPI in the setting of possible
   active GI bleeding.
   -          Consider GI consult if Hct continue to fall.
   .
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.  Began tube feeds
   yesterday [**6-14**], but stopped feeds in the setting of hypotension.  Will
   restart feeds today despite concern about GI bleeding.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Evaluate possible GI bleeding as explained under
anemia
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  In the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, will need to
   r/o C. diff.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.
   -          Test for C. diff.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well on face
   mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions,
   history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family
   would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other
   organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as below
   - diuresis as above
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, with leukocytosis
   slightly improved today at 14.3.  Patient initially met criteria for
   severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination with upper respiratory
   secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 PND.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx x 3
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   .
   # ?UTI:  Three urinalyses have had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination,
   and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum antibiotics had been
   initiated, was negative.  A third urine culture was sent yesterday
   evening [**8-15**] in the setting of hypotension.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   -          f/u urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170, although well-controlled with metoprolol
   recently.  Will decrease dose of metoprolol given recent hypotension.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   .
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG [**6-14**] depressions in I and
   V3-V6.
   - supplemental O2
   - Hold ASA today due to concern about GI bleeding
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 141 to
   214 during past 24 hours.  Received 11 units of regular insulin plus 7
   units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - With hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will likely need to
   adjust lantus this evening.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer admitted to the MICU for PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate. The patient had an episode of hypotension to SBP in the 70s around 11 pm, and EKG unchanged, pan-cultured, CXR largely unchanged, tube feeds held, bolus 500 mL of LR given, stat Hct drawn, and 1 unit of PRBCs transfused. Metoprolol was changed to 25 mg PO BID, and diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV started. The patient also has a positive MRSA screen and is on contact precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension to SBP in the mid-to-upper 70s. The differential diagnosis includes intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, and beta-blockade. The patient responded to fluid and blood transfusion. It is important to monitor and treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IV fluids, while avoiding volume overload.

2. Volume Overload: The patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR and worsened rhonchi on exam. The patient had a positive fluid balance of 1755 mL yesterday. Cautious diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction presumably leading to aspiration pneumona
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Also with cardiac ischemia,
   elevated lactate.
   # Respiratory failure and aspiration PNA:  Initially started on CPAP.
   Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia, likely due to
   aspiration.  CHF also likely contributing.  Patient initially met
   criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of
   end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary
   antigen was negative.  Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination
   with upper respiratory secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 with no growth
   to date.  He was started on Vanc and Zosyn with plans to complete a 14
   day course to end on [**8-24**].  Fever on admission resolved, and white
   count trended down from 20.5 on admission to 13.4 on discharge.
   -      Vanco, zosyn
 14-day course to end on [**8-24**]
   -          Cautious diuresis, with goal -500 cc per day
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue active pulmonary toilet/ Chest PT
   -          Would avoid NIPPV in setting of copious secretions.
   # Bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction.  Initially, there was copious dark red
   fluid draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged
   through lumen of tube.  CT showed balloon was in pylorus/antrum.
   Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing gastric outlet
   obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube,
   with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and [**6-13**], there was bloody
   discharge around the tube.  The tube was replaced by interventional
   radiology on the evening of [**6-13**] with larger tube.  Began tube feeds
   [**6-14**] and stopped in the setting of brief hypotension, then restarted.
   Patient had diarrhea and dark stools that were felt likely to be from
   this source.  GI consult was considered but risk of endoscopy to look
   for another site of bleeding would outweigh benefit and if bleeding is
   along PEG tube tract, and PEG tube bleeding would not be amenable to
   endoscopic repair.
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   -          PPI
   -          tube feeds per nutrition recs
   -          can give meds via PEG
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.  C. diff negative.
   # Possible UTI:  Three urinalyses had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, however urine cultures were negative.  Current antibiotic
   coverage would be sufficient for most UTIs.
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170.  This was well controlled with metoprolol 25 mg
   PO BID.  HR 64-104 on day of discharge.
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG [**6-14**] depressions in I and
   V3-V6.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Hold ASA today due to concern about GI bleeding
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip.  He was weaned off insulin gtt and then
   covered with lantus and ISS.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   -
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, leading to aspiration pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He also has cardiac ischemia, elevated lactate, and signs of end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia. The patient's fever on admission resolved, and his white count trended down from 20.5 on admission to 13.4 on discharge. He was started on Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam for pneumonia, and his antibiotics will be continued for a 14-day course to end on [**8-24**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure and aspiration pneumonia: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure and likely due to aspiration pneumonia. He was initially started on CPAP but is currently on supplemental O2. Continued monitoring and management of respiratory status are essential.

2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has evidence of cardiac ischemia, which may be related to his known CAD. His troponins have trended down, but focal wall motion abnormalities were seen on TTE, suggesting possible old MI. He should continue supplemental O2, ASA (unless there is concern about GI bleeding), statin, and beta-blocker. Diuresis to reduce preload may also be beneficial.

3. Bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction: The patient experienced bleeding and"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac
   ischemia, elevated lactate.  PEG was dislodged and reinserted 2 days
   PTA.  It seems that this resulted in gastric outlet obstruction, with
   subsequent vomiting 1 day PTA, and evolving pneumonia, complicated by
   severe sepsis and cardiac ischemia.  Infection improving.  Active
   issues include pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension,
   cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed.
   # Hypotension:  Patient developed transient hypotension to SBP mid to
   upper 70s yesterday evening [**8-15**] at around 11 p.m.  Urine output
   decreased to <30cc/hr for 2 hours, then picked up again.  DDx includes
   intravascular volume depletion, recurrent sepsis, cardiac dysfunction,
   and beta-blockade.  BP responsive to fluid + blood.  Decreased
   metoprolol to 25 mg [**Hospital1 7**], with holding parameters.  Currently
   normotensive.
   -          Consider untreated C. diff infection as explained below
   under
diarrhea
   -          Treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IVF.
   However, try to avoid volume overload, as this could compromise
   patient
s respiratory status.
   .
   # Volume overload:  Patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR
   and worsened rhonchi on exam.  The patient was positive 1755 mL
   yesterday.  Could not diurese yesterday due to low BP, but today, BP
   appears to leave room for cautious diuresis.
   -          Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV as blood pressure tolerates,
   with goal diuresis 1 L negative today.
   -          Check p.m. lytes.
   -          Give KCl 20 mg via PEG in setting of K 3.9 and anticipated
   drop in K with Lasix.
   .
   # Anemia:  Consider GI bleeding in the setting of slowly falling Hct,
   guaiac-positive stools, and recent dysfunction/manipulation of PEG
   tube.  Transfused 1 unit yesterday for Hct 23.6 with good response in
   Hct.
   -          Check p.m. hematocrit.
   -          Check coags.
   -          Transfuse for Hct < 25.
   -          Maintain active type and screen.
   -          Change H2 blocker to IV PPI in the setting of possible
   active GI bleeding.
   -          Attempt conservative management.  However, consider GI
   consult if Hct continue to fall.
   .
   # PEG tube dysfunction:  Initially, there was copious dark red fluid
   draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged through
   lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing
   gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by
   pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**].  Per IR,
   it is okay to use the tube but should not manipulate.  Began tube feeds
   yesterday [**6-14**], but stopped feeds in the setting of hypotension.  Will
   restart feeds today despite concern about GI bleeding.
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Evaluate possible GI bleeding as explained under
anemia
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  In the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, will need to
   r/o C. diff.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.
   -          Test for C. diff.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well on face
   mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions,
   history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family
   would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other
   organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as below
   - diuresis as above
   .
   # Pneumonia:  Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia,
   likely due to aspiration.  Fever has resolved, with leukocytosis
   slightly improved today at 14.3.  Patient initially met criteria for
   severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of end-organ dysfunction
   involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary antigen negative.
   Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination with upper respiratory
   secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 PND.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn
 14-day course
   -          f/u blood cx x 3
   -          monitor vital signs, UOP, renal function, mental status.
   .
   # ?UTI:  Three urinalyses have had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination,
   and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum antibiotics had been
   initiated, was negative.  A third urine culture was sent yesterday
   evening [**8-15**] in the setting of hypotension.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   -          f/u urine cx
   .
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170, although well-controlled with metoprolol
   recently.  Will decrease dose of metoprolol given recent hypotension.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   .
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 91-year-old man with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, hypoxemic respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and elevated lactate. The patient had a dislodged and reinserted PEG tube, resulting in gastric outlet obstruction, subsequent vomiting, evolving pneumonia, complicated by severe sepsis and cardiac ischemia. The patient's current issues include pneumonia, volume overload, intermittent hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and possible slow GI bleed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient developed transient hypotension to SBP mid to upper 70s yesterday evening. It is important to monitor and treat recurrent hypotension cautiously with blood or IV fluids while avoiding volume overload.

2. Volume overload: The patient has significant vascular congestion on CXR and worsened rhonchi on exam. Diuresis with Lasix 20 mg IV as blood pressure tolerates, with a goal diuresis of 1 L negative today, should be initiated.

3. Anemia: The patient has a slowly falling Hct, guaiac-positive stools, and recent dysfunction/manipulation of PEG tube. Consider GI bleeding as a possible cause. Check p.m. hematocrit, coags, and transfuse for Hct < 25. Maintain active type and screen.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction presumably leading to aspiration pneumona
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Also with cardiac ischemia,
   elevated lactate.
   # Respiratory failure and aspiration PNA:  Initially started on CPAP.
   Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia, likely due to
   aspiration.  CHF also likely contributing.  Patient initially met
   criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of
   end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary
   antigen was negative.  Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination
   with upper respiratory secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 with no growth
   to date.  He was started on Vanc and Zosyn with plans to complete a 14
   day course to end on [**8-24**].  Fever on admission resolved, and white
   count trended down from 20.5 on admission to 13.4 on discharge.
   -      Vanco, zosyn
 14-day course to end on [**8-24**]
   -          Cautious diuresis, with goal -500 cc per day
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue active pulmonary toilet/ Chest PT
   -          Would avoid NIPPV in setting of copious secretions.
   # Bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction.  Initially, there was copious dark red
   fluid draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged
   through lumen of tube.  CT showed balloon was in pylorus/antrum.
   Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was causing gastric outlet
   obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube,
   with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and [**6-13**], there was bloody
   discharge around the tube.  The tube was replaced by interventional
   radiology on the evening of [**6-13**] with larger tube.  Began tube feeds
   [**6-14**] and stopped in the setting of brief hypotension, then restarted.
   Patient had diarrhea and dark stools that were felt likely to be from
   this source.  GI consult was considered but risk of endoscopy to look
   for another site of bleeding would outweigh benefit and if bleeding is
   along PEG tube tract, and PEG tube bleeding would not be amenable to
   endoscopic repair.
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   -          PPI
   -          tube feeds per nutrition recs
   -          can give meds via PEG
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.  C. diff negative.
   # Possible UTI:  Three urinalyses had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, however urine cultures were negative.  Current antibiotic
   coverage would be sufficient for most UTIs.
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170.  This was well controlled with metoprolol 25 mg
   PO BID.  HR 64-104 on day of discharge.
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG [**6-14**] depressions in I and
   V3-V6.
   - Continue supplemental O2
   - Hold ASA today due to concern about GI bleeding
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload

   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip.  He was weaned off insulin gtt and then
   covered with lantus and ISS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CVA, dysphagia, CAD, and prostate cancer. He was admitted to the MICU with PEG dysfunction, leading to aspiration pneumonia with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient also had cardiac ischemia, elevated lactate, and signs of end-organ dysfunction. He was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for pneumonia, which will be continued for a 14-day course. The patient's fever resolved, and his white blood cell count trended down. 

The patient had bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction, with dark red fluid draining from the PEG tube and a balloon in the pylorus/antrum. Surgery relieved the obstruction by pulling back on the tube, and the patient's discharge resolved. The tube was replaced with a larger one, and tube feeds were started but stopped due to hypotension. The patient had diarrhea and dark stools, which were likely due to the PEG tube dysfunction. 

The patient also had acute cardiac ischemia, suspecting demand ischemia in the setting of high demand with known CAD. Troponins have trended down, and TTE showed focal wall motion abnormalities that may be from an old MI. 

Hyperglycemia was controlled with an insulin drip, and the patient was weaned off insulin gtt and covered with lantus and ISS.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction presumably leading to aspiration pneumona
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Also with cardiac ischemia,
   elevated lactate.
   # Respiratory failure and aspiration PNA:  Initially started on CPAP.
   Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia, likely due to
   aspiration.  CHF also likely contributing.  Patient initially met
   criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of
   end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary
   antigen was negative.  Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination
   with upper respiratory secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 with no growth
   to date.  He was started on Vanc and Zosyn with plans to complete a 14
   day course to end on [**8-24**].  Fever on admission resolved, and white
   count trended down from 20.5 on admission to 13.4 on discharge.
   -      Vanco, zosyn
 14-day course to [**8-24**]
   -          Cautious diuresis, with goal -500 cc per day
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   # Bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction.  Initially, there was copious dark red
   fluid draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged
   through lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was
   causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery relieved the obstruction
   by pulling back on tube, with resolution of the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and
   [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the tube.  The tube was
   replaced by interventional radiology on the evening of [**6-13**] with larger
   tube.  Began tube feeds [**6-14**] and stopped in the setting of brief
   hypotension, then restarted.  Patient had diarrhea and dark stools that
   were felt likely to be from this source.  GI consult was considered but
   risk of endoscopy to look for another site of bleeding would outweigh
   benefit and if bleeding is along PEG tube tract, and PEG tube bleeding
   would not be amenable to endoscopic repair
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   -          PPI
   - tube feeds per nutrition recs
   - can give meds via PEG
   - if PEG tube dysfunction recurs, consult surgery/IR for further
   evaluation/treatment.
   - Evaluate possible GI bleeding as explained under
anemia
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  In the setting of broad-spectrum antibiotics, will need to
   r/o C. diff.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.
   -          Test for C. diff.
   .
   # Hypoxemic respiratory distress:  Contributing factors include
   aspiration PNA and pulmonary edema from CHF.  Satting well on face
   mask.  Avoiding NIPPV in the setting of copious respiratory secretions,
   history of vomiting, and aspiration risk.  DNR/DNI, although family
   would consider intubation if pure respiratory failure without other
   organ dysfunction.
   - Monitor respiratory status
   - Supplemental O2 via face mask/nasal cannula as tolerated
   - Chest PT
   - antibiotics as below
   - diuresis as above

   # ?UTI:  Three urinalyses have had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, although the first urine culture was suggestive of contamination,
   and the second culture, sent after broad spectrum antibiotics had been
   initiated, was negative.  A third urine culture was sent yesterday
   evening [**8-15**] in the setting of hypotension.
   -          abx: vanco, zosyn, to also cover for HAP.
   -          f/u urine cx

   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170, although well-controlled with metoprolol
   recently.  Will decrease dose of metoprolol given recent hypotension.
   -          Metoprolol 25 mg PO BID.
   -          Monitor heart rate, rhythm, and BP.
   .
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with an unknown primary diagnosis. The patient has been restarted on tube feeds and is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a slightly low blood pressure. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an aerosol-cool face tent and has an SpO2 of 97%. Physical examination reveals diffuse rhonchi bilaterally, an irregular rhythm with normal rate, and distant heart sounds. The patient has a distended abdomen with bowel sounds not heard, a dressing in place of the left wrist with skin breakdown on the left elbow, trace left extremity edema, and weakness in the left upper and lower extremities. The patient's mental status is altered, with confusion and disorientation. The patient has a Foley catheter and a mushroom catheter with dark stool in the bag, indicating possible melena. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 1.0. Liver function tests are also within normal limits, but there is evidence of elevated troponin-T and CK-MB levels, suggesting possible cardiac injury.

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with CVA, dysphagia on TF via PEG, CAD, prostate CA, admitted
   to MICU with PEG dysfunction presumably leading to aspiration pneumona
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  Also with cardiac ischemia,
   elevated lactate.
   # Respiratory failure and aspiration PNA:  Initially started on CPAP.
   Clinical exam and imaging consistent with LLL pneumonia, likely due to
   aspiration.  CHF also likely contributing.  Patient initially met
   criteria for severe sepsis, with elevated lactate and signs of
   end-organ dysfunction involving cardiac ischemia.  Legionella urinary
   antigen was negative.  Sputum culture [**8-15**] had extensive contamination
   with upper respiratory secretions.  Blood cultures x 3 with no growth
   to date.  He was started on Vanc and Zosyn with plans to complete a 14
   day course to end on [**8-24**].  Fever on admission resolved, and white
   count trended down from 20.5 on admission to 13.4 on discharge.
   -      Vanco, zosyn
 14-day course to end on [**8-24**]
   -          Cautious diuresis, with goal -500 cc per day
   -          Continue Vanc/Zosyn for pneumonia
   -          Monitor electrolytes
   -          Continue active pulmonary toilet/ Chest PT
   -          Would avoid NIPPV in setting of copious secretions.
   # Bleeding/PEG tube dysfunction.  Initially, there was copious dark red
   fluid draining about PEG tube with bilious non-bloody fluid lavaged
   through lumen of tube.  Consulted surgery, who felt that the PEG was
   causing gastric outlet obstruction.  Surgery
   90M here w/ respiratory/urosepsis as well as copious clear (dark blood
   tinged) drainage from around G-tube. Had [**Doctor First Name **] replaced at [**Hospital **] rehab
   on friday, TF had been working. On CT balloon was in pylorus/antrum. GT
   (18Fr) was pulled back by me
    relieved the obstruction by pulling back on tube, with resolution of
   the discharge.  On [**6-12**] and [**6-13**], there was bloody discharge around the
   tube.  The tube was replaced by interventional radiology on the evening
   of [**6-13**] with larger tube.  Began tube feeds [**6-14**] and stopped in the
   setting of brief hypotension, then restarted.  Patient had diarrhea and
   dark stools that were felt likely to be from this source.  GI consult
   was considered but risk of endoscopy to look for another site of
   bleeding would outweigh benefit and if bleeding is along PEG tube
   tract, and PEG tube bleeding would not be amenable to endoscopic repair
   -          Continue to monitor Hct
   -          PPI
   -          tube feeds per nutrition recs
   -          can give meds via PEG
   .
   # Diarrhea:  The patient has had diarrhea, guiaic positive, for around
   3 days now.  Blood in stool most likely due to G-tube
   dysfunction/repositioning.  C. diff negative.
   # Possible UTI:  Three urinalyses had significant numbers of WBCs and
   RBCs, however urine cultures were negative.  Current antibiotic
   coverage would be sufficient for most UTIs.
   # Tachycardia
 The patient has had SVT (likely atrial tachycardia)
   with HR as high as 170.  This was well controlled with metoprolol 25 mg
   PO BID.  HR 64-104 on day of discharge.
   # Acute cardiac ischemia: Suspect demand ischemia in the setting of
   high demand with known CAD.  Troponins have trended down (most recently
   0.58 on [**6-11**], down from peak 1.72 on [**6-10**]).  TTE showed focal wall
   motion abnormalities that may be from old MI, although no old echo is
   available for comparison.  EKG [**6-14**] depressions in I and
   V3-V6.
   - supplemental O2
   - Hold ASA today due to concern about GI bleeding
   - statin
   - B-blocker
   - diuresis to reduce preload
   .
   # Hyperglycemia:  The patient has known diabetes, likely exacerbated by
   infection/stress.  Blood sugars elevated to 500s-600s on admission,
   controlled with insulin drip, and then with lantus and ISS.  BS 141 to
   214 during past 24 hours.  Received 11 units of regular insulin plus 7
   units of lantus during past 24 hours.
   - monitor blood sugars QID
   - With hyperglycemia and resumption of tube feeds will likely need to
   adjust lantus this evening.
   - holding patient
s home oral hypoglycemics while in hospital
   .
   # Hypercalcemia:  Ionized Ca mildly elevated.  Unclear etiology, given
   h/o prostate ca concern for metastatic lesions.  Bony abnormality on
   abdominal CT read as bony island.  Also consider hyperparathyroidism.
   -          No further work-up at this time, but make sure patient
   receives appropriate follow-up care.
   # Code: After lengthy discussions with son and HCP [**Name (NI) 1412**], patient
   over-all DNR/DNI and in the event of an emergency with rapid/acute
   deterioration would not resuscitate him or intubate him, however, if
   slow decline and not tolerating NIPPV family would consider trial
   intubation.
