","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old man with a history of aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), who was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient has severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis, requiring intubation. This is likely due to pneumonia with left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate seen on chest X-ray, leukocytosis with a left shift, and no physical exam findings to support pulmonary edema. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), making PE less likely than pneumonia.

2. Hypotension: The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure (SBP) is in the 90s-100s, but it dropped into the 80s this evening. This could be concerning for sepsis given ongoing pneumonia and recent wound infections. The hypotension may be due to hypovolemia and the effect of sedative medications. Lactate levels are normal.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) have been"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old man who underwent an aortic aneurysm repair, which was complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's current condition includes severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, likely due to pneumonia with a left lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. There are no physical exam findings to support pulmonary edema, and a CT angiography (CTA) was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). White blood cell (WBC) count is improving, suggesting a possible response to antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure in the 80s and heart rate in the 80s. He has mild hypoxia but is maintaining an oxygen saturation of 99% on 50% FiO2. His temperature is slightly elevated, and he has occasional myotonic jerks. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and lactate, indicating possible kidney dysfunction and tissue hypoperfusion. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Continue ventilatory support and wean sedation as tolerated.
2. Wean FiO2/PEEP gradually.
3. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam antibiotics; consider broadening to [Last Name (un) 614] if spikes or WBCs.
4. Follow up blood culture, urine legionella antigen, and sputum culture.
5. Consider thoracentesis for suspected parapneumonic effusion.
6. Rule out influenza A/B and H1N1.
7. If bronchoscopic evaluation of the airways (BXA) is positive, check for endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB).
8. Hold beta-blockers due to hypotension.
9. Monitor blood pressure closely and provide IV fluids as needed.
10. Continue aspirin and statin therapy for CAD.
11. Consider echocardiogram for cardiac evaluation.
12. Follow up with surgery recommendations.
13. Continue vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam empirically.
14. Manage hyperlipidemia with statin therapy.
15. Hold metoprolol due to recent hypotensive episodes.
16. Continue pain control for cervical myelopathy.
17. Provide nutrition support as appropriate.
18. Maintain glycemic control.
19. Monitor and manage lines and prophylaxis measures.
20. Discuss code status and disposition with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old man who underwent an aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) that was previously treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was transferred from the medical floor due to hypoxia and hypercapnia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. This condition can lead to increased carbon dioxide levels in the blood, causing acidosis and potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray and leukocytosis with a left shift, suggesting an infection. If left untreated, pneumonia can progress and lead to sepsis, respiratory failure, and other complications.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline systolic blood pressure is in the 90s-100s but has been slightly lower recently. This could be due to hypovolemia, sepsis, or the effect of sedative medications. If not properly managed, hypotension can lead to organ hypoperfusion and failure.
4. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate pleural effusion, which may be a par"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient required intubation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. The most likely cause of the respiratory failure is pneumonia with a left lower lobe infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. Other potential complications include a pleural effusion that may be parapneumonic, hypotension possibly due to sepsis, hypovolemia, or the effect of sedative medications, recent surgical procedures including AAA repair and colectomy, wound infections, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and cervical myelopathy. The patient is being treated with IV fluids, antibiotics, pain control, and monitoring of vital signs. He is also receiving nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis indicate a potential complication related to impaired gas exchange and ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with a complex medical history, including recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, severe hypercapnia, and significant respiratory acidosis. He is intubated and requires ventilatory support. There is evidence of pneumonia with a left lower lobe infiltrate on chest X-ray. His white blood cell count is improving, and he has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Other medical issues include hypotension, coronary artery disease, recent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and wound infections. The patient is also being followed by surgery for these issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia with left lower lobe infiltrate: The patient's respiratory symptoms and radiographic findings suggest a possible pneumonia. This can lead to worsening respiratory failure and sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and elevated white blood cell count indicate a possible ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Wound infections: The patient has a history of wound dehiscence and"

   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis(ABG 7.16/91/133) requiring intubation
   at presentation.  [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with
   hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and
   compressive atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary
   to a combination of medical-related mental status changes (was on
   remeron), chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
   - bronch to eval for pna though not consistent with imaging studies
   - continue ventilatory support, wean sedation as tolerated, wean
   FiO2/PEEP, attempt to extubate
   - continue vancomycin, pip-tazo ([**6-2**]-ongoing; day 3).
   - d/c levofloxacin given negative legionella

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease (CAD) who was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He is currently intubated due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 19 and low-grade fever. He also has hypotension, CAD with previous CABG and PCI, recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's severe hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis may lead to further respiratory distress and failure.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count and low-grade fever indicate a possible infection. This could be due to the wound infections or pneumonia.
3. Hypotension: The patient's baseline SBP in the 90s may indicate ongoing hypotension, which could be related to sepsis or other factors.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD and previous CABG may increase the risk of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
5. Wound complications: The patient's recent surgical procedures, including AAA repair and colectomy, put him at risk for wound infections and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. The note documents various events that occurred within a 24-hour period starting from [2201-6-5].

During this time, the patient underwent a bronchoscopy via endotracheal tube, performed by an attending physician and respiratory therapist. An ultrasound was also conducted, showing no acute intracranial hemorrhage, but revealing mild left ventricular hypertrophy and global hypokinesis with mildly depressed systolic function. The right ventricle size and motion were normal, and significant pulmonary regurgitation was observed with normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure. Ultrasound of effusions did not reveal any significant pocket amenable for thoracentesis. Influenza DFA was negative, and droplet precautions were discontinued.

The patient experienced tiredness after getting a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line placed and did poorly on systemic blood pressure (SBP) in the evening, leading to the decision not to extubate. Bronchoscopy in the morning showed no significant discharge. Ultrasounds for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were negative. Antibiotics were continued though could possibly be discontinued. The patient received a bolus overnight for low urine output. A low-grade fever was present, and a chest X-ray was ordered.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were nafcillin on [2201-6-3], lev"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
- The patient underwent a bronchoscopy on 06/05/2201 at 12:36 PM, an ultrasound on the same day at 02:00 PM, and had a PICC line started at 04:30 PM.
- Initial CT scan showed a right pleural space hematoma, no acute intracranial hemorrhage, mild left ventricular hypertrophy with global hypokinesis and mild depressed systolic function, normal right ventricular size and motion, significant pulmonary regurgitation, and normal pulmonary artery systolic pressure.
- Ultrasound of effusions did not reveal any significant pockets amenable for thoracentesis.
- Influenza DFA test was negative, and droplet precautions were discontinued.
- The patient tolerated stable blood pressure in the morning but experienced fatigue after getting the PICC line placed and did poorly on blood pressure in the evening (low tidal volume, high respiratory rate), so extubation was not performed.
- Bronchoscopy in the morning showed no significant discharge.
- UE/LE ultrasounds were negative for deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- Antibiotics were continued, although they can likely be discontinued.
- The patient received a bolus overnight for low urine output.
- Low-grade fever was present, and a pan culture was obtained.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). He was transferred to the ICU for hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient required intubation at presentation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. The underlying cause of his respiratory failure is multifactorial, including hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to medical-related mental status changes, chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.

The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.4 thousand/mm3. He has an elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and a blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL. The patient's platelet count is within normal limits. His troponin-T level is 0.30 and his CK-MB level is 20. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.16, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 91 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 30.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 76 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) of 84/51 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 99%. His temperature (T) is 37.2 degrees Celsius.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, clear oropharynx, regular heart sounds with no murmurs, rales bilaterally at the bases of the lungs, soft abdomen with no tenderness, normal extremities without edema, and occasional myotonic jerks with appropriate responses to pain stimuli.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated leukocyte count with neutrophils at 93.9%, lymphocytes at 2.0%, monocytes at 2.6%, eosinophils at 1.2%, and basophils at 0.5%. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 5.3 mEq/L. His renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 27 mg/dL. His liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment includes hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure requiring intubation, leukocytosis, hypotension, coronary artery disease with previous CABG, recent aortic aneurysm repair, colectomy, wound infections, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. The patient's plan includes continuing ventilatory support"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male who underwent an AAA repair and is currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has a history of recent abdominal surgery, effusion, atelectasis, weakness, and bronchoscopic intervention. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 76 bpm with a range of 72-102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/51 mmHg to 103/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a range of 15-38 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 99%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,120 mL and output of 771 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,349 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a pressure-controlled mode at a rate of 8 breaths per minute with an inspiratory time of 0.5 seconds, tidal volume of 350-400 mL, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is 50 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.3 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 27.0%, and platelet count (Plt) of [**Telephone/Fax (3) 7876**]. The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's troponin-T level is within normal range, suggesting no ongoing myocardial injury.

The patient's medical conditions include acute renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), acute respiratory failure (not acute respiratory distress syndrome), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's plan includes ICU care, nutrition support, glycemic control, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case include worsening respiratory failure, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia, further deterioration of renal function, progression of impaired skin integrity, and potential thromboembolic events due to immobility and prolonged mechanical ventilation."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who underwent repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and is currently intubated in the ICU. He has been experiencing effusion, atelectasis, weakness, and recent abdominal surgery. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy and ultrasonography, and a PICC line was started. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics, sedatives, and pain management. His vital signs are within normal limits, but he shows signs of decreased bowel sounds and edema in his extremities. Imaging shows stable left lower lobe collapse with small effusions. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, altered mental status, respiratory failure, and borderline hypotension. The patient's condition is being managed with appropriate respiratory support, increased PEEP, volume resuscitation, and continued antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to poor mental status, atelectasis, effusion, and weakness. To address this, the plan is to increase PEEP and keep the left side up.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has an altered mental status but is not delirious. Sedation will be withheld until he awakens.
3. Borderline Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is borderline low, and volume resuscitation will be implemented to address this issue.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's"

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old male who underwent an AAA repair and is currently intubated in the ICU. He has a history of recent abdominal surgery, effusion, atelectasis, weakness, and was bronched yesterday. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with PS 8/5 mode, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 84. His compliance is 50 cmH2O/mL, and SpO2 is 99%. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 84/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent abdominal surgery.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to poor mental status, atelectasis, effusion, and weakness. The plan includes increasing PEEP and keeping the left side up.
2. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status but is not diagnosed as delirium. Withholding sedation until he awakens is part of the plan.
3. Infection: The patient continues on antibiotics and is following cultures due to leukocytosis. 
4. Fluid Imbalance: The patient has a total fluid intake of 2,120 mL and a total output of 771 mL, indicating a positive fluid balance."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration. Monitoring serum creatinine levels, urine output, and electrolyte imbalances will be important to assess the progression of renal failure.

2. Prolonged Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's impaired skin integrity increases the risk of pressure ulcers, infections, and compromised wound healing. Regular turning, proper positioning, and meticulous skin care are essential to prevent further complications.

3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing VAP. Daily chest X-rays, sputum cultures, and surveillance for new-onset fever or leukocytosis will help in early detection and management of VAP.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin injections and early mobilization should be implemented to reduce the risk.

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis requiring intubation at presentation.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive
   atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to a
   combination of medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron),
   chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
   - f/u bronch studies
   - continue ventilatory support: wean sedation as tolerated, increase
   PEEP today to recruit compressed LLL
   - continue vancomycin, pip-tazo ([**6-2**]-ongoing; day 3).
   - d/c levofloxacin given negative legionella
   - f/u blood culture, sputum cx
   - Pleural effusion too small for [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s with baseline in 90-100. Ddx includes sepsis,
   leukocytosis and low grade temps but cx are negative and echo neg for
   endo. Alternatively high PEEP is responsible but BP low even before
   PEEP was increased to 15. Also possible is RP hematoma given CT
   findings.  Associated with low urine output. Partially responsive to
   IVF, necessitating Levo.
   - continue to monitor
   - levo for MAP>60
   # Leukocytosis:  improving, blood/sputum/stool/urine cx ngtd
   - cont vanc/zosyn for now
   - monitor
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis.
   - f/u CE
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: being followed by
   surgery
   - f/u surgery recs
   - continue vancomycin and pip-tazo empirically
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin.
   # HTN:
   - hold metoprolol given recent hypotensive episodes
   # Cervical Myelopathy: Baseline. Continue pain control

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, which is secondary to an acute-on-chronic process involving pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, medical-related mental status changes (on remeron), chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds. The treatment plan includes continuing ventilatory support, weaning sedation as tolerated, increasing PEEP to recruit compressed left lower lobe (LLL), and continuing vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn). 

The patient is also experiencing hypotension, which is partially responsive to IV fluids (IVF) and necessitates Levo. Other issues include leukocytosis, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous CABG, recent AAA repair, colectomy, and wound infections. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further hypotension leading to organ perfusion issues, infection due to ongoing leukocytosis and positive cultures, cardiac complications related to CAD and previous CABG, and potential wound dehiscence or infection due to recent surgical procedures."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with hypotension, acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and altered mental status. The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 94/46 mmHg, heart rate of 83 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated potassium levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.19 and bicarbonate level of 30 mg/dL. The patient's medications include norepinephrine, heparin sodium, fentanyl, midazolam, and various antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's altered mental status, fever, and elevated white blood cell count may suggest an underlying infection leading to sepsis.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible kidney dysfunction, which could progress to AKI.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of endotracheal tubes increase the risk of developing pneumonia.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and the presence of central lines"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The note highlights several 24-hour events, including an increase in peep to recruit lung, a family friend discussing goals of care, holding vancomycin for high level, and administering IVF boluses for hypotension. The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 06/05/2201 at 08:04 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 06/07/2201 at 12:00 AM.

The patient is currently on several infusions, including norepinephrine at 0.06 mcg/Kg/min and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 10:50 PM on 06/06/2201. They are also receiving fentanyl and midazolam (Versed).

The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted below. The flowsheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total in of 4,303 mL and a total out of 134 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,169 mL. Respiratory support includes the use of an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL,"

   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis requiring intubation at presentation.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive
   atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to a
   combination of medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron),
   chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
   - f/u bronch studies
   - continue ventilatory support: wean sedation as tolerated, increase
   PEEP today to recruit compressed LLL
   - continue vancomycin, pip-tazo ([**6-2**]-ongoing; day 3).
   - d/c levofloxacin given negative legionella
   - f/u blood culture, sputum cx
   - Pleural effusion too small for [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s with baseline in 90-100. Ddx includes sepsis,
   leukocytosis and low grade temps but cx are negative and echo neg for
   endo. Alternatively high PEEP is responsible but BP low even before
   PEEP was increased to 15. Also possible is RP hematoma given CT
   findings.  Associated with low urine output. Partially responsive to
   IVF, necessitating Levo.
   - continue to monitor
   - IVF and levo for MAP>60; wean levo as tolerated
   - s/p 1 pRBC transfusion
   # Leukocytosis:  improving, blood/sputum/stool/urine cx ngtd
   - cont vanc/zosyn for now
   - monitor
   # Anuric renal failure: Ddx includes hypovolemia/prerenal (supported by
   FeNa<1) vs ATN (in setting of hypoTN) vs contrast nephropathy (post
   CTA). Urine eos pending. U/O at 5 cc/hr. Cre 2.4 from 2.1 yesterday.
   - Consider renal c/s if cre doesn
t improve
   - continue IVF
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis.
   - f/u CE
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold metoprolol in the setting of hypotension
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: being followed by
   surgery
   - f/u surgery recs
   - continue vancomycin and pip-tazo empirically
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin.
   # HTN:
   - hold metoprolol given recent hypotensive episodes
   # Cervical Myelopathy: Baseline. Continue pain control

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with recent aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. This is secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, as well as hypercapnic respiratory failure due to medical-related mental status changes, chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
   - Follow-up bronch studies
   - Ventilatory support: wean sedation as tolerated, spontaneous breathing trial (SBP)
   - Continue vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (day 3)
   - Discontinue levofloxacin given negative legionella
   - Follow-up blood culture, sputum culture

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s with a baseline of 90-100. Differential diagnoses include sepsis, leukocytosis, and low-grade"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current health status, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may indicate inadequate circulation and potential organ damage if not properly managed.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function appears to be impaired, as indicated by elevated levels of creatinine and BUN. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and potentially life-threatening complications if not treated promptly.

3. Altered mental status: The patient's cognitive function is affected, but further information is needed to determine the underlying cause and severity. It is important to monitor for any changes in consciousness or mental clarity.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, as suggested by the need for mechanical ventilation and low oxygen saturation levels. Close monitoring and appropriate ventilator settings are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may have compromised skin health, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections. Regular turning, proper positioning, and maintaining optimal skin hygiene are crucial in preventing further complications.

6. Potential infections: The presence of a urinary catheter and the recent urine culture indicate the possibility of a urinary tract infection. Additionally, the patient's immunocompromised state due to acute illnesses and medications can make them more susceptible to other infections, such as ventil"

The patient has a history of hypotension, for which he was given IV fluids and packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and started on levophed. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely due to a combination of contrast exposure and hypovolemia. He continues to receive intravenous fluids (IVF). The patient is suspected to have acute respiratory failure, possibly caused by atelectasis, weakness, or possible pneumonia. The patient's creatinine levels are still rising. The patient's condition is being closely monitored, and plans for extubation are being considered once he awakens and shows improvement. Other medical conditions and treatments include prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and glycemic control. The patient is currently on non-parenteral nutrition (npo) in anticipation of extubation."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been hypotensive, requiring IV fluids and packed red blood cells (PRBCs). Levophed has been started for blood pressure support. The patient has a urinary catheter and has had multiple cultures obtained. The patient is receiving various medications, including norepinephrine, heparin sodium, fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's medical, social, and family history remains unchanged except for the noted above. Review of systems is also unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia, with a heart rate ranging from 74-102 bpm. Oxygen saturation is at 99%. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 4,303 mL and output of 3,842 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 461 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient's chest X-ray shows persistent left lower lobe infiltrates. The assessment and plan include hypotension being managed with levophed, renal failure due to a combination of contrast and hypovolemia, altered mental status improving, and acute respiratory failure not consistent with ARDS. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines (PICC line inserted), prophylaxis (DVT and stress ulcer), and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications for this patient include:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite receiving IV fluids and PRBCs. Continued hypotension can lead to organ perfusion issues and potential organ damage.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function. If not addressed promptly, this could progress to complete renal failure, requiring dialysis.
3. Infection: The presence of urinary catheter and persistent left lower lobe infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a risk of infection. Infections can worsen the patient's condition and increase the risk of sepsis.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition should be closely monitored for any deterioration in oxygenation or ventilation.
5. Fluid overload: The patient's positive fluid balance suggests fluid overload. This can increase the risk of pulmonary edema and cardiac complications.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheter use.
7. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status should be closely monitored for any signs of deterioration, as it may indicate worsening of the underlying condition or development of delirium.
8. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's renal failure may be exacerbated by contrast-induced nephropathy from previous imaging studies."

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man who recently underwent aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence. He also has a history of CAD and CABG. The patient was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He is currently intubated and on ventilatory support.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis, requiring intubation at presentation. This is secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic respiratory failure due to pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to a combination of medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron), chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 70s with a baseline in the 90-100 range. The differential diagnosis includes sepsis, leukocytosis, and low-grade temperatures but cultures are negative and echo is negative for endocarditis. Alternatively, high PEEP is responsible, but blood pressure is low even before PEEP was increased to 15. Also possible is RP hematoma given CT findings. Associated with low urine output. Partially responsive to IVF, necessitating Levo.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, but blood"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old man with a recent aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post-coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient requires intubation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. This is likely secondary to an acute-on-chronic process, including hypoxic respiratory failure caused by pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to medical-related mental status changes, chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been in the 70s episodically with a baseline in the 90-100 range, likely related to high PEEP (15). However, the hypotension has now resolved. The baseline blood pressure is systolic in the 90s. Sepsis is not considered a concern at this time.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection. Blood, sputum, stool, and urine cultures have been sent for analysis.

4. Anuric renal failure: The patient"

The patient was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to an acute on chronic process, including pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, as well as potential diaphragmatic weakness versus midbrain lesion. Other contributing factors include medical-related mental status changes and abdominal wounds.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and chronic kidney disease. He was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, likely secondary to an acute on chronic process including pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, diaphragmatic weakness, midbrain lesion, medical-related mental status changes, and abdominal wounds. He is currently intubated and receiving ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires continuous monitoring and management. Weaning sedation as tolerated and performing bronch studies are part of the plan to address this complication.
2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodic hypotension, which has now resolved. It is important to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 and provide IV fluids as needed.
3. Anuric renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with an increase in creatinine from 2.4 to 2.9. Contrast nephropathy post CTA is the suspected cause. Further evaluation and management of renal function are necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis requiring intubation at presentation.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive
   atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure with question of
   diaphragmatic weakness vs midbrain lesion. Also likely contribution
   from medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron) and
   abdominal wounds.  Off vancomycin, pip-tazo ([**Date range (1) 7938**]) given negative
   cultures to date.
   - ventilatory support: wean sedation as tolerated, SBP
   - plan for EMG study today by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1621**]
   - f/u bronch studies
   - f/u blood culture, sputum cx
   - Pleural effusion too small for [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s episodically with baseline in 90-100, likely
   in the setting of high PEEP (15), but has now resolved.  Baseline BP is
   SBP in 90s.  Concern for sepsis is low.
   - IVF as needed for MAP>60
   - s/p 1 pRBC transfusion
   # Leukocytosis:  improving, blood/sputum/stool/urine cx ngtd. Off
   vanc/zosyn [**6-8**]
   - monitor
   # Anuric renal failure: U/O at 20 cc/hr. Cre 2.9 from 2.4 yesterday.
   Thought to be [**2-9**] contrast nephropathy post CTA. Ddx includes
   hypovolemia/prerenal (supported by FeNa<1) vs ATN (in setting of
   hypoTN). Urine eos negative; U/A notable for 59 RBC and 19 WBC. Renal
   u/s without hydronephrosis.
   - F/u renal recs
   - Repeat U/A
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis. Trop
   elevation likely in setting of renal failure; CK flat.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - restart low-dose metoprolol given PVCs, hemodynamic stability
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: being followed by
   surgery. Off vanc/zosyn as above.
   - f/u surgery recs
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue statin.
   # HTN:

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 79-year-old male with recent aortic aneurysm repair, complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound dehiscence. He also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

The patient was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He required intubation due to severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis. The cause of his respiratory failure is multifactorial, including acute on chronic respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, critical illness neuromyopathy, medical-related mental status changes, and abdominal wounds.

The patient's recent medical issues include recent AAA repair, colectomy, and wound infections. There is concern for a new abscess as purulent drainage from the incision site and rectum. The patient has been restarted on vancomycin and Zosyn for broad coverage, and a CT abdomen/pelvis is pending for further evaluation.

Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis, anuric renal failure, hypotension, CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cervical myelopathy. The patient's condition has been stable overall, with improvements in leukocytosis and urine output. His blood pressure has also improved, and his cardiac enzymes are within normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: with severe hypercapnia and
   significant respiratory acidosis requiring intubation at presentation.
   [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute on chronic process with hypoxic
   respiratory failure secondary to pleural effusions and compressive
   atelectasis, and hypercapnic respiratory failure with evidence of
   critical illness neuromyopathy on EMG. Also likely contribution from
   medical-related mental status changes (was on remeron) and abdominal
   wounds.
   - given lack of respiratory effort for >1 minute on [**Last Name (un) **] this AM, will
   disucss with family about goals of care.
   - ventilatory support: pressure support trial this PM; cont to wean
   sedation as tolerated with daily SBT
   - vancomycin, zosyn discontinued ([**Date range (1) 7938**]) for tx of pneumonia given
   negative cultures to date
   - pleural effusion too small for [**Female First Name (un) 217**]
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: Being followed by
   surgery with concern for new abscess as purulent drainage from incision
   site and rectum. Zosyn restarted for broad coverage; vanco level
   supratherapeutic. However, CT abd/pelvis stable on prelim read.
   Leukocytosis cont to improve and pt remains afebrile.
   - Restart vanco per level, cont zosyn for now
   - F/u final CT abd/pelvis read
   - Await surgery recs
   # Leukocytosis: Nl WBC today. Restarted on vanc/zosyn given question of
   abscess as above; blood/sputum/stool/urine cx ngtd.
   - Monitor
   # Anuric renal failure: U/O cont to improve: 20cc/h -> 30 cc/h; Cr
   stable at 2.9. Thought to be [**2-9**] contrast nephropathy post CTA with
   ATN. Ddx includes hypovolemia/prerenal (supported by FeNa<1). Renal u/s
   without hydronephrosis.
   - F/u renal recs
   - wife ambivalent about proceeding with HD if pt again requires
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s episodically with baseline in 90-100, likely
   in the setting of high PEEP (15), but has now resolved.  Baseline BP is
   SBP in 90s.  Concern for sepsis is low.
   - IVF as needed for MAP>60
    - Pt on low-dose metoprolol
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis. Trop
   elevation likely in setting of renal failure; CK flat.
   - Restarted low-dose metoprolol given PVCs, hemodynamic stability
   - Home ASA not restarted given possibility of surgery; also off statin
   # HTN:
   - Cont low-dose metoprolol with stable BP
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Off home statin
   # Cervical Myelopathy: Baseline. Continue pain control

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old man with a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, critical illness neuromyopathy, anuric renal failure, leukocytosis, hypotension, CAD, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cervical myelopathy. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, development of new infections, cardiac complications, and further deterioration of neurological status. 

The patient is receiving various treatments and interventions, including mechanical ventilation, sedation, antibiotics, renal support, and pain management. The family has changed the patient's code status to do not resuscitate (DNR)."

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 79-year-old man who has been admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and hypercapnia. He has a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis with wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic/Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis, which required intubation. This respiratory failure is likely due to an acute on chronic process involving pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, critical illness neuromyopathy, medical-related mental status changes, and abdominal wounds.

2. Recent AAA Repair, Colectomy, Wound Infections: The patient had a recent abdominal aortic aneurysm repair and colectomy. There are concerns for new abscess formation as there is purulent drainage from the incision site and rectum. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Zosyn and vancomycin) have been restarted due to the suspicion of an abscess, although the CT abdomen/pelvis is currently stable.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has improved, but leukocytosis is still present. The restarted vancomycin and zosyn are being monitored, and blood, sputum, stool, and urine cultures are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old man with multiple medical conditions, including recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and renal failure. He was admitted to the ICU for hypoxia and hypercapnia. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, leukocytosis, anuric renal failure, hypotension, and cervical myelopathy. He has been receiving various treatments and medications, including antibiotics, vasopressors, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory status indicates severe hypercapnia and significant respiratory acidosis, requiring intubation. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the patient does not improve or if there are complications during weaning off the ventilator.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. There is a risk of sepsis recurrence due to the presence of abscesses and ongoing infections.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has anuric renal failure, which means his kidneys are not producing urine. This could be due to contrast nephropathy, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or hypovolemia. There is a risk of worsening renal function or progression to end-stage renal disease.
4. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, likely related to high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels. This could indicate septic shock or other causes of low blood pressure. Close monitoring and management of fluid balance are essential to maintain adequate perfusion.
5. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of CAD and CABG, with evidence of reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% and global hypokinesis on echocardiography. There is a risk of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
6. Wound Infections: The patient has ongoing wound infections from the surgical procedures, including the aortic aneurysm repair and colectomy. There is a risk of abscess formation and worsening infection.
7. Cervical Myelopathy: The patient has a pre-existing condition of cervical myelopathy, which may contribute to his neurological symptoms and could worsen if not properly managed.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, renal function, fluid balance, infection parameters, and cardiac status. Appropriate management strategies should be implemented to prevent or minimize the potential medical complications mentioned above."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old man with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of his health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has a history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis with wound dehiscence, and coronary artery disease with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
- He was transferred from the medical floor due to hypoxia and hypercapnia, which led to intubation at presentation.
- The patient's respiratory failure is secondary to pleural effusions, compressive atelectasis, medical-related mental status changes, chest wall weakness, and abdominal wounds.
- His blood pressure has been episodically low but has now resolved, and there is concern for sepsis, which is low.
- The patient has leukocytosis, likely due to infection, and his renal function is impaired, possibly due to hypovolemia, acute tubular necrosis, or contrast nephropathy.
- His cardiovascular system shows evidence of coronary artery disease with previous CABG and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction.
- The patient has multiple complications related to his recent surgeries, including wound infections.
- He also has hyperlipidemia and hypertension, for which appropriate medications are being continued or adjusted.
- The patient is being treated for cervical myelopathy, with continued pain control.
- In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutritional support through"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 year-old man with recent aortic aneurysm repair ([**1-/2201**]),
   complicated by ischemic bowel and sepsis with subsequent wound
   dehiscence, also with h/o CAD s/p CABG who is transferred from the
   medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.
   # Hypoxic/Hypercarbic respiratory failure: [**Month (only) 51**] be secondary to an acute
   on chronic process with hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to
   pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, and hypercapnic
   respiratory failure with evidence of critical illness neuromyopathy on
   EMG. Also likely contribution from medical-related mental status
   changes (was on remeron) and abdominal wounds.  Had been treated with
   vanc/zosyn empirically [**Date range (1) 7938**] for pneumonia but stopped as bacterial
   cx had been neg. Sucessfully extubated yesterday.
   - Wean O2 as tolerated
   - Pt DNR/DNI
   # Recent AAA repair, colectomy, wound infections: Followed by Surgery.
   Appears that left retroperitoneal abscess has drained spontaneously
   through left flank incision site. Zosyn restarted for broad coverage;
   vanco level supratherapeutic. Leukocytosis cont to improve and pt
   remains afebrile. Wound cx now growing rare corynebacterium.
   - Will curbside ID re: significance of corynebacterium and need for tx

   - Will d/w pt if wound proceed with HD; wife ambivalent
   # Hypotension: BP in 70s episodically with baseline in 90-100, likely
   in the setting of high PEEP (15) and sedation. Now resolved.
   - Pt restarted on home low-dose metoprolol
   - Address GOC re: pressors if future need
   # CAD: ECG unchanged from prior. CABG in [**2184**]. Multiple PCI. No active
   issues or complaints.  ECHO with LVEF of 40%, global hypokinesis. Trop
   elevation likely in setting of renal failure; CK flat.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with a medical history of recent aortic aneurysm repair, ischemic bowel, sepsis, wound dehiscence, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and other comorbidities. The patient was transferred from the medical floor for hypoxia and hypercapnia.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure due to acute on chronic process with pleural effusions and compressive atelectasis, as well as critical illness neuromyopathy evident on electromyography (EMG). There is also a contribution from medical-related mental status changes and abdominal wounds. The patient had been treated empirically with vancomycin (Vanc) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for pneumonia but stopped as bacterial cultures were negative. The patient was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's recent surgical history includes AAA repair, colectomy, and wound infections. It appears that the left retroperitoneal abscess has drained spontaneously through the left flank incision site. Zosyn was restarted for broad coverage, and vancomycin levels are supratherapeutic. Leukocytosis continues to improve, and the patient remains afebrile. The wound culture is now growing rare Corynebacterium species.

The patient's renal function is compromised, with anuric renal failure. Creatinine has improved to 2.4 today with continued increasing urine output (U/O) of 50cc/h. This is thought to be contrast nephropathy post computed tomography angiography (CTA) with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). A renal ultrasound did not show hydronephrosis.

The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, likely in the setting of high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and sedation. This has since resolved. The patient has been restarted on home low-dose metoprolol and will be addressed regarding the use of pressors if future need arises.

The patient's CAD history includes a previous CABG in [**2184**] and multiple percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The ECG is unchanged from prior, with no active issues or complaints. An echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% with global hypokinesis. Troponin elevation is likely in the setting of renal failure; creatine kinase (CK) levels are flat.

The patient's other conditions include hyperlipidemia, for which a statin has been restarted. Additionally, the patient has cervical myelopathy, which will be managed with pain control.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is currently NPO pending a speech/swallow consultation for aspiration risk. When resuming oral intake, a low-sodium cardiac diet will"
