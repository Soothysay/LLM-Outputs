   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # NSTEMI - Troponins trending down, painfree.
   - For now, optimal medical management with ASA, BB, statin and
   eventually ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - transfuse for hct < 30 if symptomatic
   - ? furthur workup later (stress, cath, MR, CT) vs attributing events
   to GIB.
   .
   # acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Pt improving with 4L net diuresis
   yest, but still appears fluid overloaded.
   - Will continue diuresis with lasix drip
   - ECHO showed no WMA or valvular disease, rather impaired relaxation
   - Continue to wean O2 as tolerates
   - Continue to attempt rate control to allow for diastolic filling and
   forward flow. Unclear why continues to be so tachycardic (see below).
   .
   # Sinus Tachycardia: Has been tachycardic since taken off BiPAP, thus
   likely secondary to resp discomfort.
   - Have been increasing doses of BB to allow for diastolic filling time
   but have only decreased HR to 90s with increase of metoprolol from
   12.5mg TID to 75mg TID and a few 5mg IV additional doses.
   .
   # GI bleed: Presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission and
   transfusion hct has been stable.
   - Given ACS will have to transfuse to goal HCT of 30 with symptoms.
   - Type and screen, IVs, guaiac stool
   - GI following
   - protonix drip at 8mg/hr switch to PO BID today
   -having hard stool now, seen by GI in ED, consented by GI for EGD in
   case, likely in future
   -? cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had any further characterization,
   since then has cut down his drinking.  will send albumin.  No other
   stigmata of liver disease.  Varicies are another possible source but
   cirrhosis / portal hypertension seems unlikely
   .
   # Anemia: Acute from GIB but likely also chronic aspect.
   - ? workup, MCV normal with very slightly elevated RDW. (? Hemolysis,
   CKI, MDS, mild iron def with macrocytic)
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal failure: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap continues to be elevated at 16 with
   normal albumin.
   - Lactate normal, no sign of ketoacidosis
   - Possibly uremia
   - ? check tox screen or osmolar gap to eval for ingestions. IE:
   Ethylene glycol -> cardiopulm failure, renal failure, AG acidosis.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Afebrile with downtrending WBC.  Elevated WBC likely as
   a result of acute MI.
   - CXR with improved CHF but RLL opacity ? edema vs PNA. Will recheck
   today.
   - UCx, BCx pending
   - re-culture if spikes, consider antibiotics based on CXR findings from
   today. ?Got broad spectrum abx upon initial presentation.
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, will increase to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presents with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 103.8°F (39.9°C) at one point, indicating a possible infection.

2. Vital Signs: The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 97 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 145/44 mmHg to 90/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula.

3. Physical Examination: The patient exhibits signs of fluid overload, including dullness at the left lung base and bilateral rales. The patient also has moderate abdominal distension and a palpable liver edge 3 cm below the costal margin. Trace bilateral pedal edema is noted, with more prominence on the right side.

4. Lab Results:
   - Hemoglobin (Hb): 11.7 g/dL
   - Hematocrit (Hct): 31.9%
   - White Blood Cell Count (WBC): 13.3 - 22.2 K/uL

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. The patient is still febrile despite being on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures have been obtained, and the white blood cell count has increased to 22 today. The patient had several bowel movements overnight and remains lethargic. Prostate exam shows an enlarged prostate, but no evidence of boggy prostate. A chest X-ray reveals a hazy opacity in the right lower lobe, unclear if this is evolving pneumonia. 

The patient is also being evaluated for Clostridium difficile infection and has been started on intravenous metronidazole. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, following up with cultures, and performing a computed tomography scan of the head today. 

The patient's acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure is resolving, but he is not taking oral fluids well. Gentle fluids will be given, and oral beta-blockers will be switched to intravenous administration. An echocardiogram will be done to rule out vegetations. 

The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation, with his heart rate in the low 100s. Oral aspirin will be held for now, and intravenous beta-blockers will be given every eight hours and as needed for heart rates above 100. 

Additionally, the patient presented with gastrointestinal bleeding, but since admission and transfusion, his hematocrit has been stable. An upper endoscopy will be performed once the patient is stable. 

The patient has chronic renal failure with baseline creatinine levels around 2.6, which remains the same today. Monitoring will continue. 

The patient also has diabetes, for which he is taking Lantus insulin once every twelve hours and a sliding scale insulin to keep blood glucose levels below 150. 

Other plans include advancing the diet, performing an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, and placing pneumoboots for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and contact information for the healthcare proxy and family members is provided."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU and presents with multiple medical conditions. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing a fever with a maximum temperature of 102.6°F (39.2°C) on [**2181-12-12**] at 08:00 AM. This could indicate an ongoing infection.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heart rhythm. This condition can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.

3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient is diagnosed with C. diff infection, which is a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea and colitis. It is commonly associated with antibiotic use.

4. Altered mental status: The patient exhibits altered mental status, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or organ dysfunction.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremity, which is a blood clot in a deep vein. This increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if the clot dislodges.

6. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient has other cardiac rhythm disturbances besides AFIB, which may include arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia or atrial flutter.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.

   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:  Appears stable with persistent
   abdominal distension but slightly decreased WBC and increasing urine
   output.  Nonetheless, severe abdominal pain and inflammation is
   concerning.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc; might consider Vanc enema if worsening.
   - Surgery following but patient is at high risk for surgery given
   intolerance of anemia in the setting of GI bleed.
   - IVF to keep UOP > 25 cc/hr
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving.  He required IV resuscitation that will need
   to be removed once cleared from acute infection.
   - O2 as needed
   - gental rehydration
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter on this admission, although no
   record of this previously.  Had an episode that broke last week with
   metoprolol and dilt.  He again had an episode last night that broke
   spontaneously.  Would consider restarting dilt if needed for HR control
   as he may not be intolerant of decreased filling time.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presents with acute on chronic diastolic heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. He has a likely progression of events involving gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, cardiac ischemia, and tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time. The patient is also diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, diastolic congestive heart failure, sinus tachycardia, GI bleed, acute on chronic renal failure, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has persistent abdominal distension, severe abdominal pain, and inflammation despite receiving IV flagyl and PO Vanc. There is a concern for worsening symptoms, which may require further interventions such as a Vanc enema.
2. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's condition initially presented as CHF but has since improved. However, he required IV resuscitation and ongoing management with O2 and gentle rehydration.
3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter during this admission, although no prior history was recorded. These episodes broke spontaneously and with metoprolol and diltiazem. There is a consideration for restarting diltiazem for HR control.
4. GI bleed: The patient presented with Hct drop and melena. Although his Hct has stabilized, there is ongoing concern"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and treatment.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has a confirmed C. diff infection, as indicated by positive cultures. He is currently being treated with IV metronidazole and oral vancomycin. Surgical consultation was sought but the patient is considered a poor surgical candidate. The patient's abdominal distension and severe abdominal pain are concerning despite some improvement in WBC count and urine output.

2. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient initially presented with CHF exacerbation but has since improved. He required IV resuscitation and will need to have his fluids removed once cleared from the acute infection. O2 therapy as needed and gentle rehydration are part of his management plan.

3. Sinus tachycardia: The patient had episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter during this admission, although no record of this was found previously. One episode broke spontaneously and another one broke with metoprolol and diltiazem. The patient may need restarting diltiazem for HR control since he may not be intolerant of decreased filling time.

4. GI bleed: The patient presented with Hct drop"

   CT Abd/pelvis: Diffuse stranding about the colon consistent with pan
   colitis. Given + cultures for C.Diff this is the most likely cause.
   Evaluation of the vessels for ischemic cause impossible given lack of
   contrast but not in the correct distribution. No evidence of
   perforation. Small bilateral effusions. Non- specific dilation4 of the
   small bowel to 3.6 cm. Healed left lateral rib fractures.
   Blood culture NG.  C. diff (+)
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.
   .
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION
 On PO and IV flagyl and PO Vanc.
   Surgery is following.  Currently stable.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc
   - IVF to keep UOP > 25 cc/hr
   - Serial abdominal exams
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  His presentation is consistent
   with acute on chronic CHF.  He was significantly diuresed, now 9L
   negative for [**Location **] O2 as needed
   - gental rehydration
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS: Low-grade temperature and persestantly elevated white
   count.  Elevated WBC could be a result of acute MI, DVT, but might also
   represent slowly brewing infection.  Urine culture negative.  Blood
   cultures pending.  CXR with no evidence of new infiltrate.
   - No antibiotics for now
   - Follow cultures.
   - re-culture if spikes
   .
   # LEG PAIN:  [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to compression from pneuomboots.  No
   swelling, but must r/o DVT.  Also possibly related to gout in setting
   of diuresis, but no evidence of joint symptoms on exam.
   - vascular ultrasound today
   .
   # NON-ST ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION - He presented with chest pain
   for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T
   wave changes on EKG.  His troponins came down over his first day and he
   remains pain free.  He was started on medical management with ASA, BB,
   statin, with a goal of adding an ACEi when renal function stabilizes.
   - ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   - transfuse for hct < 25 if symptomatic
   - Will consider further diagnostic workup with stress, cath, MR, or CT
   once stable.
   .
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had A-fib/A-flutter last night that broke with
   iincreased nodal blocking.  Will continue on increased doses of
   metoprolol 100 TID and dilt 60 mg QID, as diastolic HF not tolerant of
   A-fib.
   .
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable, although Hct is somewhat down this
   morning.  Stools remain guiac positive.  Given chest pain free, ok to
   allow Hct to drift to 25.  He had cirrhosis 30 years ago but hadn't had
   any further characterization, since then has cut down his drinking.  No
   physical exam findings of liver disease, but ultrasound showed fatty
   change.  US findings could be consistent with cirrhosis but is more
   likely related to congestion.
   - Will recheck Hct in PM
   - GI following, scope planned for monday but may need to be earlier if
   bleeding picks up.
   - protonix PO BID
   .
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Baseline Cr 1.6, Peak here 3.
   - History consistent with prerenal causes but FeUrea not consistent
   (45%). [**Month (only) 8**] be ATN secondary to prolonged hypoperfusion, vs med related,
   vs postrenal.
   - If not improving obtain renal ultrasound
   .
   # ANION GAP ACIDOSIS: anion gap was elevated on admission without
   significant lactare or ketones and modestly elevated BUN.  This has
   since resolved, with a gap today of 12.
   .
   # HYPERKALEMIA: resolved with diuresis
   .
   # DM: lantus 7uqhs.  insulin sliding scale, goal BG < 150.
   - Poor control, so lantus increased to 10U
   .
   FEN: Will advance diet.  NPO when planned for EGD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical complications that can arise include:

1. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient is currently being treated with oral and intravenous Flagyl (metronidazole) as well as oral vancomycin. Surgery is following, and the patient is described as stable.

2. Diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's presentation is consistent with acute on chronic CHF. The patient has been significantly diuresed and is now 9L negative for oxygen as needed. Gentle rehydration is recommended.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could be due to an acute myocardial infarction (MI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or a slowly brewing infection. Blood cultures are pending, and no antibiotics have been started yet.

4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient presented with chest pain for 48 hours prior to admission and positive troponins but no ST or T wave changes on the electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient's troponins came down over the first day, and he remains pain-free. The patient is being managed medically with aspirin (ASA), beta-blocker (BB), and a statin. Further diagnostic workup with stress, catheterization, magnetic resonance (MR), or computed tomography (CT) will be considered once the patient is"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CT Scan:
   1. Focus of eccentric dilatation of descending colon, in the left lower
   quadrant, with asymmetrical distribution of contrast and air and
   significant fat tissue stranding, which either represents acute
   diverticulitis or perforation realted to colitis. There is currently no
   evidence of free intraperitoneal spillage or air.
   2. Second eccentric dilatation, which might be site of giant sigmoid
   diverticulum.No inflammation is seen around this and while contrast is
   seen within it it does not appear to represent an acute finding.
   3. There is no small-bowel obstruction, the dilated loops of the small
   bowel are likely due to ileus.
   4. Severe pancolitis-relative sparing proximally.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small basilar
   atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure.

   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.  Course
   complicated by severe CDiff colitis
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:
   - On exam appears stable (abdomen distended, tympanitic and tender in
   LLQ)
   - CT scans showed pancolitis and area of ? contained bowel perforation
   vs diverticulitis. Reevaluated by surgery but considered to not require
   urgent surgery as continues to be hemodynamically stable, abd pain not
   worsening and poor surgical candidate.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc; PR Vanco if no improvement.
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving. Has been getting IVF in setting of infection
   and hypotension, responding well with UOP.  Satting well.
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.
   - Will consider EGD once acute medical issues resolved.
   - protonix PO BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Returned to baseline of 2.2. Continue
   IVF as per adequate UOP.
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be
   new for pt) now resolved.
   - Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF and

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, resulting in anemia and cardiac ischemia. The patient's condition further complicated by severe Clostridium difficile infection, diastolic congestive heart failure, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Progressive deterioration of heart failure symptoms due to worsening diastolic dysfunction.
2. Development of new or worsening arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or flutter.
3. Worsening of renal function, leading to further fluid retention and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Persistent or recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, potentially requiring surgical intervention.
5. Increased risk of developing pressure ulcers due to immobility.
6. Possible need for tracheostomy placement if prolonged mechanical ventilation is required.
7. Risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
8. Potential need for endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures, such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), to evaluate and manage ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's condition and potential complications based on the provided information. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine the best course"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   CT Scan:
   1. Focus of eccentric dilatation of descending colon, in the left lower
   quadrant, with asymmetrical distribution of contrast and air and
   significant fat tissue stranding, which either represents acute
   diverticulitis or perforation realted to colitis. There is currently no
   evidence of free intraperitoneal spillage or air.
   2. Second eccentric dilatation, which might be site of giant sigmoid
   diverticulum.No inflammation is seen around this and while contrast is
   seen within it it does not appear to represent an acute finding.
   3. There is no small-bowel obstruction, the dilated loops of the small
   bowel are likely due to ileus.
   4. Severe pancolitis-relative sparing proximally.
   5. Bilateral pleural effusion with some adjacent small basilar
   atelectasis, and evidence of prior asbestos exposure.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.  Course
   complicated by severe CDiff colitis
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:
   - On exam appears stable (abdomen distended, tympanitic and tender in
   LLQ)
   - CT scans showed pancolitis and area of ? contained bowel perforation
   vs diverticulitis. Reevaluated by surgery but considered to not require
   urgent surgery as continues to be hemodynamically stable, abd pain not
   worsening and poor surgical candidate.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc; PR Vanco if no improvement.
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving. Has been getting IVF in setting of infection
   and hypotension, responding well with UOP.  Satting well.
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.
   - Will consider EGD once acute medical issues resolved.
   - protonix PO BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Returned to baseline of 2.2. Continue
   IVF as per adequate UOP.
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be
   new for pt) now resolved.
   - Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF and
   dependency on filling time

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and coronary artery disease. He presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation, acute coronary syndrome, and severe C. difficile colitis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Progression of C. difficile infection: The patient has severe C. difficile colitis, which can lead to worsening abdominal pain, diarrhea, and systemic illness if not properly managed.

2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presented with an acute coronary syndrome. There is a risk of further cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction if not managed appropriately.

3. Diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and is currently experiencing an exacerbation. This condition can lead to fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and poor cardiac output if not managed effectively.

4. Renal failure: The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease and there is a risk of further deterioration of renal function due to the ongoing infection and fluid management.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding, which can recur if not treated properly.

6. Asbestos exposure-related complications: The patient has evidence of prior asbestos exposure, which increases the risk of developing complications such as pleural effusion and lung fibrosis.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presents with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS. Likely progression of events: GIB -> Anemia ->
   Cardiac ischemia -> Tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time + 2U
   pRBC for Hct 22 in setting of chest pain -> CHF exacerbation.  Course
   complicated by severe CDiff colitis
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:
   - On exam appears stable (abdomen distended, tympanitic and tender in
   LLQ)
   - CT scans showed pancolitis and area of ? contained bowel perforation
   vs diverticulitis. Reevaluated by surgery but considered to not require
   urgent surgery as continues to be hemodynamically stable, abd pain not
   worsening and poor surgical candidate.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc; PR Vanco if no improvement.
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving. Has been getting IVF in setting of infection
   and hypotension, responding well with UOP.  Satting well.
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.
   - Will consider EGD once acute medical issues resolved.
   - protonix PO BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Returned to baseline of 2.2. Continue
   IVF as per adequate UOP.
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be
   new for pt) now resolved.
   - Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF and
   dependency on filling time

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome. The patient's likely progression of events included gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, cardiac ischemia, and tachycardia with poor diastolic filling time. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit level of 22 in the setting of chest pain, which led to a worsening of congestive heart failure. The patient also has severe Clostridium difficile infection, as indicated by a CT scan showing pancolitis and an area of possible contained bowel perforation versus diverticulitis. The patient is currently being treated with IV flagyl and PO Vanc, with PR Vanco if there is no improvement. Other medical issues include acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease with a previous non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's current condition is stable, with ongoing management and monitoring in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yoM w/ h/o CKD presented with acute on chronic diastolic CHF
   exacerbation and ACS in the setting of GI bleed, then developed C. diff
   colitis while awaiting EGD/colonoscopy.
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:  Continues to be stable to
   improving.  Abdomen distended, tympanitic and slighltly less tender in
   LLQ, WBC down and afebrile.  CT scans showed pancolitis and area of
   possible contained bowel perforation vs diverticulitis.  He was
   reevaluated by surgery but considered not to require surgery as
   continues to be hemodynamically stable, abd pain not worsening and poor
   surgical candidate.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc.
   - NPO
   - IV nutrition as will be NPO for several days
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving. Has been getting IVF in setting of infection
   and hypotension, responding well with UOP.  Satting well without
   crackles on exam.  Will continue to monitor with conservative fluid
   repleation as needed.
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Currently Guiac negative.
   - Will consider EGD once acute medical issues resolved.
   - protonix IV BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Returned to baseline of 2.2. Continue
   IVF as per adequate UOP.
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   # SINUS TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be
   new for pt) now resolved.
   - Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF and
   dependency on filling time
   FEN: NPO for bowel rest.  Nutrition consult for TPN recs
   ACCESS: PIV's.  Will attempt to place PICC today for TPN.

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding. He developed Clostridium difficile infection while awaiting esophagogastroduodenoscopy/colonoscopy.

Summary:
- The patient is stable to improving with no fever or significant pain.
- Vital signs are stable, with blood pressure within normal range.
- The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.
- Respiratory support is not required.
- Physical examination shows distended abdomen with tympanicity and tenderness in the left lower quadrant, but no rebound or guarding.
- Extremities are warm and well-perfused.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Bowel perforation: The CT scan showed an area of possible contained bowel perforation versus diverticulitis. If the bowel perforation worsens or becomes uncontained, it could lead to severe infection, sepsis, and potentially death.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has a history of diabetes. Poorly controlled diabetes or inadequate insulin administration can lead to DKA, which is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of diastolic congestive heart failure and acute coronary syndrome. Further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or heart failure exacerbation may"

   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:  Continues to be stable to
   improving.  Abdomen distended, tympanitic and slighltly less tender in
   LLQ, WBC down and afebrile.  CT scans showed pancolitis and area of
   possible contained bowel perforation vs diverticulitis.  He was
   reevaluated by surgery but considered not to require surgery as
   continues to be hemodynamically stable, abd pain not worsening and poor
   surgical candidate.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc.
   - NPO and NPR
   - IV nutrition as will be NPO for several days
   Abd distended/firm.  No pain.  active BS.  Passing mucoid stool [**4-10**]
   times/night.
   # MALNUTRITION: PICC misplaced, will be readjusted today by IR,
   meanwhile started PPN.
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Originally presented in CHF, but
   has since been improving. Has been getting IVF in setting of infection
   and hypotension, responding well with UOP.  Satting well without
   crackles on exam.  Will continue to monitor with conservative fluid
   repleation as needed.
   # GI BLEED: He presented with Hct drop and melena but since admission
   and transfusion Hct has been stable.  Currently Guiac negative.
   - Will consider EGD once acute medical issues resolved.
   - protonix IV BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Returned to baseline of 2.2. Continue
   IVF as per adequate UOP.
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol, Statin
   # TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be new for
   pt) now resolved.
   -          Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF
   and dependency on filling time
   # HYPERTENSION: Increased dose of Lopressor to 20mg IV q4hrs
   FEN: NPO for bowel rest.  Nutrition consult for TPN recs

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) who presented with acute-on-chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.
- The patient developed Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis while awaiting esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)/colonoscopy.
- The patient's abdomen is distended, tympanitic, and slightly less tender in the lower left quadrant (LLQ). White blood cell (WBC) count is down, and the patient is afebrile. Computed tomography (CT) scans show pancolitis and an area of possible contained bowel perforation versus diverticulitis.
- Surgery reevaluation determined that the patient does not require surgery as he is hemodynamically stable, abdominal pain is not worsening, and he is considered a poor surgical candidate.
- The patient is currently receiving intravenous (IV) Flagyl and oral Vancomycin.
- The patient is nothing by mouth (NPO) and nasogastric tube (NGT) are in place. Parenteral nutrition (PPN) has been started due to expected prolonged NPO status.
- The patient's diastolic congestive heart failure is improving, with good response"

   colitis while awaiting EGD/colonoscopy.
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Na 147, trending upwards.  Likely secondary to being
   NPO and lack of free water in TPN.  Deficit is 2.5L.
   -          Will start patient on D5 @ 100cc/hr, for 1.5L.  Will hold if
   patient
s SBP > 160.
   # CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE INFECTION:  No longer tender abdomen but still
   distended. Decreased stool frequency and volume.   Improved.
   - Not currently surgical emergency.  Surgery recommends starting po
   once patient has started to have proper BMs.  Will start Ice chips
   today.
   - IV flagyl, PO Vanc.
   - NPO and NPR
   # DIASTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE:  Appears euvolemic.
   - Will monitor closely as patient is receiving IVFs
   # GI BLEED: Presented with GIB, but since then has been stable, guaiac
   neg and Hct stable.
   - will defer EGD until stable
   - protonix IV BID
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: Improved.  Cr 1.6.  Renal function
   better than baseline of 2.2
   # DM: On lantus and ISS (amaryl held while NPO)
   # CAD
 s/p NSTEMI in setting of GI bleed, not cathed.
   - Medically managed with ASA, Metoprolol
   # TACHYCARDIA: Had episodes of A-fib/A-flutter (confirmed to be new for
   pt) now resolved.
   - Can restart dilt if HR control required, given diastolic CHF and
   dependency on filling time
   # HYPERTENSION: SBPs have been has high as 170s.  Concern for possible
   flash pulmonary edema.
   -          Continue Lopressor to 20mg IV q4hrs

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease who presented with acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure exacerbation and acute coronary syndrome in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient also developed Clostridium difficile colitis while awaiting endoscopy. The patient is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 147, which is likely secondary to being NPO (nothing by mouth) and lack of free water in total parenteral nutrition (TPN). A deficit of 2.5 liters is noted. To address this, the plan is to start the patient on D5 (5% dextrose) at 100cc/hr for 1.5 liters, but to hold if the patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) is greater than 160.

2. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient has symptoms consistent with C. difficile infection, including decreased stool frequency and volume. Although the abdomen is still distended, there is improvement. The plan is to start the patient on ice chips today and continue IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. The patient will remain NPO (nothing by mouth) and NPR (nothing per rectum) for now.

3. Diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient appears euvolemic but has signs of diastolic congestive heart failure"
