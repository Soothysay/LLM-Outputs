   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 82M with who presents with abdominal pain and is found
   to have pancreatitis and renal failure.
   .
   * Abdominal pain / Pancreatitis
   His abdominal pain presentation seems most consistent with
   pancreatitis. He has severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC,
   and LDH), no evidence of necrosis on imaging - though limited by lack
   of contrast. Likely due to gallstone, though stone not visualized on
   imaging -- may have passed stone. No history of EtoH abuse. No mass
   reported on imaging, TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above
   baseline suggesting hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with
   nl albumin.
   DDX of his abdominal pain also includes cholangitis, PUD, and coronary
   ischemia (discussed below) and even constipation. No history of
   gastroparesis. These alternative seem less likely to account for his
   significant pain.
   - ERCP as above
   - IVF
   - Morphine as needed for pain control
   - Consider enteral feeds after ERCP done tomorrow
   .
   * Leukocytosis
   His presentation with leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and jaundice is
   concerning for cholangitis. However he has not had fevers, chills, or
   sweats making this somewhat less compelling (with caveat that infection
   may present atypically in elderly) - and time course is less acute.
   Pancreatitis itself could also account for the leukocytosis and even
   bandemia, but need to rule out additional infectious process. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - Empiric Amp/sulbactam
   - ERCP in AM
   - Surgery and GI recs appreciated
   - F/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis
   Likely due to biliary obstruction however would expect his ALKP to be
   elevated. In setting of infection consider also shock liver -- but less
   likely as not hypotensive here. Other causes such as EtoH, viral
   hepatitis, ingestion less likely. With his diabetes he may have
   underlying NASH -- though prior LFTs have been unremarkable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Add on direct bilirubin
   - Acetaminophen level
   - Will hold on sending viral hepatitis serologies for now
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient has been taking significant amount of aspirin and ibuprofen
   recently which may be contributory. He may be prerenal from decreased
   PO -- or 3rd spacing given suspected infection and pancreatitis. No
   evidence for hypotension so ATN less likely.
   - Hydration overnight
   - Check urine lytes
   - Continue to trend Cr, follow urine output
   - Spin urine in AM if Cr not improved with hydration
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Gap acidosis
   Probably due to lactic acidosis in the setting of infection and
   metformin use with renal failure. Not hyperglycemia less likely DKA. No
   history of injestion. Renal failure itself may also be contributory.
   - Treating suspected cholangitis as above
   - IVF
   - Lactate and ABG.
   - Serum tox
   - Osms
   - Repeat electrolytes
   .
   * LBBB
   In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump think less likely to have
   acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG in our system since [**2150**]
   so the timing of the LBBB development is uncertaion. He does report
   symptoms concerning for stable angina so a repeat outpatient stress
   would be reasonable.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   - Repeat cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Mild decrease in platelets worrisome for a consumptive process such as
   sepsis. No splenomegaly.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily for now
   .
   * Heme positive stools
   With his NSAID use may have gastritis or even PUD. With his prior
   endovascular graft, need to consider aorto-enteric fistula though I
   think this is much less likely. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S, PIV x2
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Consider repeat endoscopy as an outpatient. Will get limited view of
   upper GI tract on ERCP.
   .
   * DM
   - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
   - Hold atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency and infection. His
   mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect decreased atenolol
   clearance (also consider vagal response with pain or ischemia, but less
   likely)
   .
   * COPD
   - Continue home inhalers
   - Wean O2 to target O2 sat >92%
   - Check ABG given SOB, tachypnea
   .
   * Constipation
   In setting of pancreatitis, ileus is a possibility. Reported passing
   flatus so SBO less likely.
   - lactulose enema

","The patient's progress note indicates that he is an 82-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including renal failure, acute pancreatitis, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis and renal failure. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Pancreatitis: This condition can lead to systemic inflammation and can potentially result in organ dysfunction. It may also cause complications such as pseudocysts, abscesses, or necrosis.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is already compromised, and further deterioration can occur due to factors such as inadequate fluid resuscitation, use of nephrotoxic drugs, or sepsis.

3. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection. This could be due to cholangitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or secondary infection related to pancreatitis. Timely identification and treatment of infection are crucial.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings are relatively low, indicating a risk of hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, dehydration, or renal failure. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary.

5. Hyperglycemia: Given the patient's history of diabetes, it is important to monitor his blood glucose levels closely. Hyperglycemia can complicate the course of his"

   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
   s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  He has
   severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC, and LDH), no
   evidence of pancreatitic necrosis on imaging - though limited by lack
   of contrast.  No history of EtoH abuse. No mass reported on imaging,
   TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above baseline suggesting
   hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with nl albumin.
   - D5W with Bicarb for now to treat severe metabolic acidosis following
   procedure
   - Morphine as needed for pain control
   - NGT placement for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures q12hrs
   - check ionized calcium q4hrs
   - switch to fentanyl and versed bolus sedation
   - will require more access following ERCP
 central line and A-line
   today
   .
   * Leukocytosis
   Most likely due to his gallstone pancreatitis, but ruling out
   additional infectious processes. No evidence of GU or pulmonary
   infection.
   - Empiric Amp/sulbactam for gram negative rods
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis
   Likely due to biliary obstruction given high direct bili.  However,
   would expect his ALKP to be elevated in an obstructive process. In
   setting of infection consider also shock liver -- but less likely as
   patient has been hemodynamically stable. Other causes such as EtoH,
   viral hepatitis, ingestion less likely. With his diabetes he may have
   underlying NASH -- though prior LFTs have been unremarkable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will hold on sending viral hepatitis serologies for now
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
   Patient has been taking significant amount of aspirin and ibuprofen
   recently which may be contributory. He may be prerenal from decreased
   PO -- or 3rd spacing given suspected infection and pancreatitis. No
   evidence for hypotension so ATN less likely.
   - IVF
   - Check urine lytes
   - Continue to trend Cr, follow urine output
   - Spin urine in AM if Cr not improved with hydration
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Gap acidosis
   Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD with acute
   metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactic acidosis in the
   setting of infection.  Can also consider metformin use with renal
   failure. Not hyperglycemia less likely DKA. No history of injestion.
   Renal failure itself may also be contributory.
   - IVF, will give Bicarb for now in the acute setting given severe
   acidosis following ERCP
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * LBBB
   In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump think less likely to have
   acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG in our system since [**2150**]
   so the timing of the LBBB development is uncertain. He does report
   symptoms concerning for stable angina so a repeat outpatient stress
   would be reasonable.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
   Mild decrease in platelets worrisome for a consumptive process such as
   sepsis. No splenomegaly.  Concern for DIC in setting of acute
   pancreatitis
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   - monitor hapto, fibrinogen, d-dimer, FDP
   .
   * Heme positive stools
   With his NSAID use may have gastritis or even PUD. With his prior
   endovascular graft, need to consider aorto-enteric fistula though I
   think this is much less likely. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S, PIV x2
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Consider repeat endoscopy as an outpatient. Will get limited view of
   upper GI tract on ERCP.
   .
   * DM
   - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
   - Hold atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency and infection. His
   mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect decreased atenolol
   clearance (also consider vagal response with pain or ischemia, but less
   likely)
   .
   * COPD
   - MDIs while on the vent
   - Wean O2 to target O2 sat >92%
   - Check ABG given SOB, tachypnea
   .
   * Constipation

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including acute pancreatitis, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. 

The patient presented with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis and renal failure. The ERCP showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis. He has severe disease by Ranson's criteria but no evidence of pancreatic necrosis on imaging. 

The patient's current assessments and plans include:

1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely secondary to pancreatitis. His baseline BUN/creatinine levels were 26-27/1.4-1.5. He is receiving IV fluids and his medications are being renally dosed.

2. Pain Control: The patient received a total of 10 mg of IV morphine in the ED and has been in pain for three days prior to admission. He has not experienced pain relief with Tylenol and ibuprofen. 

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis with elevated lipase levels. He is being treated with antibiotics (Flagyl and levofloxacin) due to the presence of sludge and pus in the bile duct.

4. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is on an Atrovent inhaler and his oxygen saturation is above 95% at"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with moderate respiratory distress and supraclavicular retractions. He also has icteric sclerae, distended abdomen, and grimacing with light palpation. His vital signs include a blood pressure of 147/63 mmHg, heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of leukocyte count, bands, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, lactate, and troponin-T. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for hypocalcemia. The imaging studies reveal pancreatic inflammation and a large gallbladder, but no necrosis or calcification.

The patient's assessment and plan include severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia. He has been diagnosed with SIRS and has undergone an ERCP procedure, which showed sludge, pus, and stones in the bile duct. The patient's current condition requires aggressive monitoring of electrolytes and acid/base status.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to prerenal"

   sludge, pus and stones, leukocytosis with bandemia; sphincterotomy
   performed, and stent placed. Very severe pancreatitis
 hemodynamically
   stable. Will need aggressive monitoring of electrolytes and acid/base
   status.
   - IVF resuscitation
   - careful electrolyte monitoring
   - bladder pressure and UOP monitoring
   - OGT/NGT needs to be placed for decompression
   - surgery recs for ?repeat imaging
   - unasyn
   - monitor LFT's
   - place [**Year (4 digits) 1618**] for CVP monitoring and central venous sat measurement
   Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
 patient is unable to maintain
   adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis. Will remain vented
   for now
 was initially on [**5-29**] but seems to be sucking hard at the ETT
   and ABG indicated failure of respiratory compensation. Will try tube
   compensation to minimize dead space, sedating and ventilating on AC at
   high respiratory rate.
   -place [**Month/Day (1) **]
   Mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis - patient has
   known COPD with poor FEV1
 old ABG indicates Co2 retention. Acute
   metabolic acidosis with a small gap in the setting of acute
   pancreatitis and cholangitis. Continuing with bicarb repletion for now.
   Will use vent to compensate more effectively at this time.
   ARF - likely prerenal azotemia. IVF repletion.
   Thrombocytopenia - no heparin products - could be marrow supression vs.
   DIC
   - check coags, hapto, d-dimer, fibrinogen
   New LBBB - ROMI. Seems to be new from [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain.
   Can follow up with stress as outpatient.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed sludge, stones, and pus in the biliary tree, leading to the performance of sphincterotomy and stent placement.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, with moderate respiratory distress and supraclavicular retractions. The vital signs indicate tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient has a distended abdomen and grimaces with light palpation. There are also icteric sclerae, cool extremities, and wheezing on chest auscultation.

Laboratory results show elevated leukocyte count with 30% bands, elevated transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, as well as elevated lipase and amylase. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. Imaging studies reveal pancreatic inflammation and a large gallbladder without evidence of necrosis or calcification. 

The patient's assessment and plan include severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia. The patient is also diagnosed with SIRS due to the presence of leukocytosis with bandemia. The plan involves"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 82M with who presents with abdominal pain and is found
   to have pancreatitis and renal failure.
   .
   # Acute repiratory failure
 Pt continued to be ventilated s/p ERCP due
   to ** ?severe metabolic acidosis, airway protection. Pt received much
   fluids overnight and now may be fluid overloaded. Tolerating PSV 5/5
   very well this AM.
   -ABG
   -SBTs
   -Extubation later today
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
   s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  He has
   severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC, and LDH), no
   evidence of pancreatitic necrosis on imaging - though limited by lack
   of contrast.  No history of EtoH abuse. No mass reported on imaging,
   TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above baseline suggesting
   hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with nl albumin.
   - Continue LR
   - Morphine as needed for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures q12hrs
   - check ionized calcium q4hrs
 replete as necessary.
   - switch to fentanyl and versed bolus sedation
   -appreciate surgery recs
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - Empiric Amp/sulbactam for gram negative rods
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Trending downwards. Likely due to biliary obstruction
   given high direct bili.  However, would expect his ALKP to be elevated
   in an obstructive process. In setting of infection consider also shock
   liver -- but less likely as patient has been hemodynamically stable.
   Other causes such as EtoH, viral hepatitis, ingestion less likely. With
   his diabetes he may have underlying NASH -- though prior LFTs have been
   unremarkable.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will hold on sending viral hepatitis serologies for now
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 with worsening renal function
   despite aggressive hydration. UOP now increasing to 50-60cc/hr. Patient
   has been taking significant amount of aspirin and ibuprofen recently
   which may be contributory. He may be prerenal from decreased PO -- or
   3rd spacing given suspected infection and pancreatitis. Pt had episodes
   of hypotension s/p ERCP, so ATN also possible.
   - continue IVF
   - Continue to trend Cr, follow urine output
   - Spin urine as Cr not improved with hydration
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 AG 13 today. Acidosis improving. Patient likely has
   chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD with acute metabolic acidosis
   from the pancreatitis.  Lactic acidosis in the setting of infection.
   Can also consider metformin use with renal failure. Renal failure
   itself may also be contributory.
   - continue LR
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina so a
   repeat outpatient stress would be reasonable.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia - Mild decrease in platelets worrisome for a
   consumptive process such as sepsis. No splenomegaly.  Concern for DIC
   in setting of acute pancreatitis. DIC labs are trending in right
   directions.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   - monitor hapto, fibrinogen, d-dimer, FDP
   .
   * Heme positive stools
   With his NSAID use may have gastritis or even PUD. With his prior
   endovascular graft, need to consider aorto-enteric fistula though I
   think this is much less likely. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S, PIV x2
   - Follow Hct daily
   - Consider repeat endoscopy as an outpatient. Will get limited view of
   upper GI tract on ERCP.
   .
   * DM
   - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
   - Hold atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency and infection. His
   mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect decreased atenolol
   clearance (also consider vagal response with pain or ischemia, but less
   likely)
   .
   * COPD
   - MDIs while on the vent
   - Wean O2 to target O2 sat >92%
   - Check ABG given SOB, tachypnea

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis. He presents with abdominal pain and is found to have pancreatitis and acute renal failure. He underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but continued to be ventilated due to severe metabolic acidosis and airway protection. The patient may be fluid overloaded, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information. These include acute respiratory failure, leukocytosis, transaminitis, acute on chronic renal failure, gap acidosis, left bundle branch block (LBBB), thrombocytopenia, heme-positive stools, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient is currently ventilated and has a history of COPD. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure, especially if there are complications such as pneumonia or fluid aspiration.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammation. This could be due to the pancreatitis or another underlying condition.

3. Transaminitis: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential liver injury or inflammation. This could be related to the pancreatitis or other causes such"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis. He is currently admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/57 mmHg to 171/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, mild jaundice, crackles at the lung bases bilaterally, soft and distended abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, and warm extremities without edema.

Laboratory findings indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, lactate, lipase, amylase, D-dimer, and low levels of hemoglobin, platelets, calcium, and albumin. The patient's ABG results show metabolic acidosis with appropriate compensation on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's assessment and plan include management of renal failure, pain control, pancreatitis, COPD exacerbation, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PP"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Unable to maintain adequate compensation for his
   metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure). Underlying COPD.
   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35,
   pCO2= 50.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial once metabolic
   acidosis improves/resolves.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 old
   ABG indicates Co2 retention. Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure. Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF
   repletion, monoitor.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- avoid heparin products - could be marrow supression
   vs. DIC.  Check coags, hapto, d-dimer, fibrinogen
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 monitor and replete.  [**Month (only) 51**] require constant infusion.
   LBBB, NEW -- ROMI. Seems to be new from [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest
   pain. Can follow up with stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable, no evidence for acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains with significant NGT output.  Hold TF.
   Consider TPN if remains intubated and with ileus.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   HTN -- holding usua antihypertensives.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. He remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's respiratory failure is due to an inability to maintain adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis, which is likely caused by infection and renal failure. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a critical concern as he is unable to maintain adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis. Close monitoring of ABG and maintaining mechanical ventilation to maintain pH between 7.30-7.35 and pCO2 of 50 is necessary. Once metabolic acidosis improves, a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation may be considered.

2. Acidosis: The patient has mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis. The underlying COPD with poor FEV1 contributes to the chronic respiratory acidosis. The acute metabolic acidosis is due to renal failure and infection. Monitoring ABG values and maintaining mechanical ventilation will help compensate for the acidosis.

3. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient's acute pancreatitis is attributed to gallstones. An ERCP procedure was performed to extract stones, drain pus, and place a stent. Monitoring liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase/lipase levels is important. IV fluid res"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Unable to maintain adequate compensation for his
   metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure). Underlying COPD.
   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35,
   pCO2= 50.  Hope to work towards SBT and extubation trial once metabolic
   acidosis improves/resolves.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 old
   ABG indicates Co2 retention. Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure. Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF
   repletion, monoitor.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- avoid heparin products - could be marrow supression
   vs. DIC.  Check coags, hapto, d-dimer, fibrinogen
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 monitor and replete.  [**Month (only) 51**] require constant infusion.
   LBBB, NEW -- ROMI. Seems to be new from [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest
   pain. Can follow up with stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable, no evidence for acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains with significant NGT output.  Hold TF.
   Consider TPN if remains intubated and with ileus.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   HTN -- holding usual antihypertensives.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The respiratory failure is due to an inability to maintain adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure) and underlying COPD. 

The patient has mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. The ABG indicates CO2 retention, and the patient's pH is below the normal range. 

The patient also has acute renal failure, likely prerenal azotemia and contrast dye-induced renal failure. There is thrombocytopenia, possibly due to marrow suppression or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

The patient requires fluid resuscitation, monitoring of I/O, and maintenance of a CVP >10 cm H2O. Hypocalcemia needs to be monitored and repleted. 

The patient has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) that seems to be new, but without symptoms of chest pain. The patient's COPD is stable, and nutritional support is needed due to significant NGT output. The patient's diabetes and hypertension should be monitored as well. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on systemic anticoagulation, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and venous thromboembolism (VAP) prevention measures. The patient's code status"

   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Remains on AC with high respiratory rate due to
   inability to compensate for his metabolic acidosis as he is a chronic
   retainer.  Pt has been receiving high volumes of LR  and is likely
   fluid overloaded. New R haziness on CXR which may represent VAP (read
   as pleural effusion) but pt without white count and fever. [**Month (only) 51**] also
   have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Pt is out of 48h
   window for aggressive hydration and acidosis is improving
   -Monitor clinically for signs of infection/VAP
   -Respiratory failure will improve with resolution of his metabolic
   acidosis
   -Goal even today with UOP>30cc/hr.
   -will try to decrease RR as acidosis improves
   - Follow up ABGs
   - monitor CVP
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. He has severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC,
   and LDH), no evidence of pancreatitic necrosis on imaging - though
   limited by lack of contrast.  No history of EtoH abuse. No mass
   reported on imaging, TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above
   baseline suggesting hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with
   nl albumin.
   - Continue Unasyn (day 4/5-7)
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures qday
   - check ionized calcium q2- q4hrs
 replete as necessary.
   - appreciate surgery recs (diuresis
 will hold for now; TPN, 5-7d
   unasyn, bladder pressure qday)
   - Maintain UOP > 30cc/hr
   - ERCP: Will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
Renal function slightly improved from
   yesterday despite aggressive hydration. UOP is good with 70 cc/hr
   overnight. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes. Yesterday, Fe urea was 31% suggesting he
   was pre-renal. No Eosinophils on urine smear so AIN less likely. No
   casts noted on Urine specimen but pt may have ATN but no casts.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 now with anemia. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional, but T. bili increasing (last to resolve in obstruction)
   despite other LFTs decreasing. D. bili elevated on admission, not
   trended. Other DIC labs are trending in right direction. Concern for
   hemolysis vs hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Also with heme positive stools
   on admission. With his NSAID use may have gastritis or even PUD. With
   his prior endovascular graft, need to consider aorto-enteric fistula
   though I think this is much less likely. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.
   -Send Haptoglobin although it may be elevated in inflammatory state;
   peripheral smear
   -Repeat CT abdomen
 if Hct continues to decrease
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient.
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - Empiric Amp/sulbactam for gram negative rods
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Trending downwards. T bili still elevated but will be
   last to resolve.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 Continued gap acidosis (AG=13), most likely due to
   uremia. Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD
   with acute metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactate is
   normal.
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets increasing. Mild decrease in platelets
   worrisome for a consumptive process such as sepsis. No splenomegaly.
   Concern for DIC in setting of acute pancreatitis. DIC labs are trending
   in right directions.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   - Stop checking DIC labs
   .
   * DM
   - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
   - Hold atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency and infection. His
   mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect decreased atenolol
   clearance (also consider vagal response with pain or ischemia, but less
   likely)

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and benign hypertension. He presented with abdominal pain and was found to have pancreatitis and acute renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, pain control, and suspected gallstone pancreatitis. His condition has been complicated by several medical complications including hypercarbic respiratory failure, anemia, leukocytosis, transaminitis, gap acidosis, left bundle branch block (LBBB), thrombocytopenia, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of COPD and is experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure due to the inability to compensate for metabolic acidosis. There is also a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with a baseline BUN/creatinine of 26-27/1.4-1.5. The cause of AKI could be due to pre-renal, intrinsic renal, or post-renal factors. Monitoring urine output, trends in creatinine, and fluid balance are essential.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe gallstone pancreatitis, and there is a concern for complications such as necrosis,"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 82M with who presents with abdominal pain and is found
   to have pancreatitis and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Remains on AC with high respiratory rate due to
   inability to compensate for his metabolic acidosis as he is a chronic
   retainer.  Pt has been receiving high volumes of LR  and is likely
   fluid overloaded.
   -Respiratory failure will improve with resolution of his metabolic
   acidosis
   -Pt is out of 48h window for aggressive hydration and acidosis is
   improving. Continue LR at 150cc/hr.
   -will try to decrease RR as acidosis improves
   - Follow up ABGs
   -monitor CVP
   -Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. He has severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC,
   and LDH), no evidence of pancreatitic necrosis on imaging - though
   limited by lack of contrast.  No history of EtoH abuse. No mass
   reported on imaging, TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above
   baseline suggesting hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with
   nl albumin.
   - Continue LR at 150cc/hr
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures q12hrs
   - check ionized calcium q2- q4hrs
 replete as necessary.
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Maintain UOP > 30cc/hr
   - ERCP: Will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks, cont NPO and NG
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
Renal function slightly improved from
   yesterday despite aggressive hydration. UOP is good with 70 cc/hr
   overnight. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes. Yesterday, Fe urea was 31% suggesting he
   was pre-renal. No Eosinophils on urine smear so AIN less likely. No
   casts noted on Urine specimen but pt may have ATN but no casts.
   - continue LR at 150cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr, follow urine output
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 now with anemia. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional, but T. bili increasing despite other LFTs decreasing. D.
   bili elevated on admission, not trended. Other DIC labs are trending in
   right direction. Concern for hemolysis vs hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
   Also with heme positive stools on admission. With his NSAID use may
   have gastritis or even PUD. With his prior endovascular graft, need to
   consider aorto-enteric fistula though I think this is much less likely.
   Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices.
   -Send Haptoglobin although it may be elevated in inflammatory state
   -? Repeat CT abdomen
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient.
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - Empiric Amp/sulbactam for gram negative rods
   - f/u surgery and GI recs
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Trending downwards. Likely due to biliary obstruction
   given high direct bili.  However, would expect his ALKP to be elevated
   in an obstructive process. Other causes such as EtoH, viral hepatitis,
   ingestion less likely.
   - Continue to trend LFTs
   - Will hold on sending viral hepatitis serologies for now
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 Continued gap acidosis (AG=13), most likely due to
   uremia. Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD
   with acute metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactate is
   normal.
   - continue LR
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets increasing. Mild decrease in platelets
   worrisome for a consumptive process such as sepsis. No splenomegaly.
   Concern for DIC in setting of acute pancreatitis. DIC labs are trending
   in right directions.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   - Stop checking DIC labs
   .
   * DM
   - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
   - Hold atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency and infection. His
   mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect decreased atenolol
   clearance (also consider vagal response with pain or ischemia, but less
   likely)

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and a recent episode of abdominal pain. He has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and acute pancreatitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 143/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on AC 500x26 with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild icterus, conjunctival pinkness, mild jaundice in the mouth and throat, distant heart sounds, soft distended abdomen with tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, warm extremities without edema, palpable distal pulses, and mildly jaundiced skin.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lipase levels. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. The urine culture shows no growth, and the abdominal ultrasound reveals mild dilation of the left atrium with normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic function, but cannot exclude focal wall motion abnormality.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Unable to maintain adequate compensation for his
   metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure). Underlying COPD.
   Maintain mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35,
   pCO2= 50.  New  RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton.  Hope to work towards
   SBT and extubation trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and
   VAP responds to therapy.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 old
   ABG indicates Co2 retention. Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure. Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF
   repletion, monoitor.
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- Could be marrow supression vs. DIC.  Check coags,
   haptoglobin, d-dimer, fibrinogen.  Avoid heparin products.
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 monitor and replete.  [**Month (only) 51**] require constant infusion.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable, no evidence for acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains with significant NGT output.  Hold TF.
   Consider TPN if remains intubated and with ileus.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   HTN -- holding usual antihypertensives.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. He also has several other medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and a left bundle branch block. The patient's current medications include PPI for stress ulcer prophylaxis and systemic anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to underlying COPD and the presence of a new right lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's profound metabolic acidosis needs to be closely monitored and managed. This could be due to infection, renal failure, and other factors.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient's hypocalcemia requires monitoring and repletion. Severe hypocalcemia can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and neuromuscular excitability.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may progress if not appropriately managed. It is likely prerenal azotemia with superimposed contrast dye-induced renal failure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's thrombocytopenia could"

   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Pt had high peak pressures yesterday despite
   treatment with nebs. Tidal volume and RR were decreased. Acidosis is
   improving. Pt has received high volumes of fluid and is likely fluid
   overloaded. [**Month (only) 51**] also have atelectasis from increased abdominal
   pressure. VAP unlikely at this time as he has no white count and
   remains afebrile. Barriers to extubation include weakness and need to
   transition him from this metabolic acidosis to his baseline chronic
   respiratory acidosis as his bicarbonate is currrently where it would be
   expected for a metabolic acidosis alone.
   -Diurese gently with goal -500cc total. 10mg IV lasix today. Monitor
   CVPs.
   -Vent settings: will decrease RR to goal minute ventilation 7-8. F/u
   ABGs
 we would tolerate a lower pH and slighlty increased CO2. Once we
   have reached this setting, we will change back to PSV (difficult as he
   is weak now). Respiratory failure will improve with resolution of his
   metabolic acidosis
   -Monitor clinically for signs of infection/VAP
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable  -change to bolus sedation
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. Note Ca low on presentation with nl albumin.
   - Continue Unasyn (day 5/5-7)
 will d/c in AM.
   -TPN for nutrition
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures qday
   - check ionized calcium q4hrs, esp with diuresis
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs (diuresis, TPN, trend LFTs)
   - Maintain UOP > 30cc/hr
   - ERCP: Will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good
   with 100 cc/hr overnight. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis,
   pre-renal, ATN given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct decreases
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - unasyn for GNR
 will stop tomorrow
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Most likely from pancreatitis. LFTs added today per
   surgery
s request
   - LFT
s every other day.
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 Gap is closing. (AG=11), most likely due to uremia.
   Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD with acute
   metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactate remains normal.
   - Change vent settings as above
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets now increasing.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   * DM
 Glucose elevated today.  Unable to determine if insulin
   increased in TPN.
   -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   -Will adjust ISS as necessary if hyperglycemia persists.
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Pt with labile BP with sedation. Holding atenolol
   in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -start metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally cleared
   -monitor BP closely

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and continues to require ventilator support. High peak pressures were observed yesterday, indicating possible airway resistance or increased airway pressures. Tidal volume and respiratory rate were decreased to improve oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's metabolic acidosis is improving, but there may be some fluid overload due to high fluid intake.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Although bile levels are still elevated, other liver function tests are decreasing. The patient is receiving pain management with fentanyl and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for nutrition. An ERCP is planned in 6 weeks.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. Creatinine levels are trending downward, and urine output is good. The differential diagnosis includes third-spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal azotemia, and acute tubular necrosis. The patient is being closely monitored for any changes in renal function and is receiving diuretics to maintain urine output.

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 82M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Pt had high peak pressures yesterday despite
   treatment with nebs. Tidal volume and RR decreased. Acidosis is
   improving. Pt has received high volumes of fluid and is likely fluid
   overloaded. [**Month (only) 51**] also have atelectasis from increased abdominal
   pressure.
   -Monitor clinically for signs of infection/VAP
   -Respiratory failure will improve with resolution of his metabolic
   acidosis
   -Goal even today with UOP>30cc/hr.
   -will try to decrease RR as acidosis improves
 allow permissive
   hypercapnea
   - Follow up ABGs
   - monitor CVP
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. He has severe disease by Ransons's (score=3 for age, WBC,
   and LDH), no evidence of pancreatitic necrosis on imaging - though
   limited by lack of contrast.  No history of EtoH abuse. No mass
   reported on imaging, TGs previously unremarkable. Hct elevated above
   baseline suggesting hemoconcentration. Note Ca low on presentation with
   nl albumin.
   - Continue Unasyn (day 5/5-7)
   -TPN for nutrition
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures qday
   - check ionized calcium q2- q4hrs
 replete as necessary.
   - appreciate surgery recs
   - Maintain UOP > 30cc/hr
   - ERCP: Will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good
   with 100 cc/hr overnight. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis,
   pre-renal, ATN given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct continues to decrease
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - Empiric Unasyn for gram negative rods
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Most likely from pancreatitis. LFTs not checked today
   as they have been trending downwards.
   - check LFTs tmrw vs stop checking.
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 Gap is closing. (AG=11), most likely due to uremia.
   Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD with acute
   metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactate remains normal.
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets now increasing.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   * DM - Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   .
   * HTN
 Pt with labile BP with sedation. Hold atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency. His mild bradycardia on presentation might reflect
   decreased atenolol clearance.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 82-year-old male with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure.
2. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 189/74 to 206/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
3. The patient's abdominal exam shows tenderness in the right upper quadrant and epigastrium, but no rigidity or guarding.
4. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, high levels of glucose and lactic acid, low levels of calcium, hemoglobin, and platelets.
5. Imaging tests reveal no evidence of pancreatitis necrosis, but limited by lack of contrast. No history of ethanol abuse and no reported mass on imaging.
6. The patient's renal function is improving with a decreasing creatinine level.
7. The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level, which may be dilutional due to fluid administration. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin is elevated and peripheral smear is essentially normal.
8. The patient has leukocytosis, which has resolved, most likely due to gallstone pancreatitis. No evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
9. The patient has transaminitis,"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory failure is due to an inability to maintain adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure) along with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's acidosis is a mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis, likely attributed to acute pancreatitis and cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP with stone extraction, stent placement, and monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase/lipase levels.

The patient also has acute renal failure, possibly prerenal azotemia and contrast dye-induced renal failure. This is slowly improving, and the patient's urinalysis should be monitored. The patient's thrombocytopenia is stable, and he should be monitored. Fluid resuscitation continues with net volume resuscitation, monitoring of input/output (I/O), central venous pressure (CVP), and maintaining a CVP >10 cm H2O.

The patient's hypocalcemia has improved, and he should be monitored for any further changes. A new left bundle branch block (LBBB) has been noted, but the patient is asymptomatic and can be followed up with stress testing as an outpatient.

The patient's COPD is stable with evidence of mild acute exacerbation,"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient has respiratory failure and is unable to maintain adequate compensation for his metabolic acidosis (infection, renal failure). He has underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of the bed, performing daily mouth care, and assessing the respiratory system for new infiltrates.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to prerenal azotemia and contrast dye-induced renal failure. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count. Monitoring for bleeding complications and close observation are necessary.

4. Hypocalcemia: The patient has low calcium levels. Monitoring for symptoms of hypocalcemia and repletion as needed is important.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent DVT, such as using compression stockings or systemic ant"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Pt had high peak pressures yesterday despite
   treatment with nebs. Tidal volume and RR were decreased. Acidosis is
   improving. Pt has received high volumes of fluid and is likely fluid
   overloaded. [**Month (only) 51**] also have atelectasis from increased abdominal
   pressure. VAP unlikely at this time as he has no white count and
   remains afebrile. Barriers to extubation include weakness and need to
   transition him from this metabolic acidosis to his baseline chronic
   respiratory acidosis as his bicarbonate is currrently where it would be
   expected for a metabolic acidosis alone.
   -Diurese gently with goal -500cc total. 10mg IV lasix today. Monitor
   CVPs.
   -Vent settings: will decrease RR to goal minute ventilation 7-8. F/u
   ABGs
 we would tolerate a lower pH and slighlty increased CO2. Once we
   have reached this setting, we will change back to PSV (difficult as he
   is weak now). Respiratory failure will improve with resolution of his
   metabolic acidosis
   -Monitor clinically for signs of infection/VAP
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable  -change to bolus sedation
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. Note Ca low on presentation with nl albumin.
   - Continue Unasyn (day 5/5-7)
 will d/c in AM.
   -TPN for nutrition
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures qday
   - check ionized calcium q4hrs, esp with diuresis
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs (diuresis, TPN, trend LFTs)
   - Maintain UOP > 30cc/hr
   - ERCP: Will need repeat ERCP in 6 weeks
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good
   with 100 cc/hr overnight. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis,
   pre-renal, ATN given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct decreases
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   * Leukocytosis
 resolved. Most likely due to his gallstone
   pancreatitis, but ruling out additional infectious processes. No
   evidence of GU or pulmonary infection.
   - unasyn for GNR
 will stop tomorrow
   - f/u blood cultures and reculture if febrile
   .
   * Transaminitis- Most likely from pancreatitis. LFTs added today per
   surgery
s request
   - LFT
s every other day.
   .
   * Gap acidosis
 Gap is closing. (AG=11), most likely due to uremia.
   Patient likely has chronic respiratory acidosis due to COPD with acute
   metabolic acidosis from the pancreatitis.  Lactate remains normal.
   - Change vent settings as above
   - follow Lactate and ABG
   - monitor electrolytes
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 Platelets now increasing.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   * DM
 Glucose elevated today.  Unable to determine if insulin
   increased in TPN.
   -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital
   -Will adjust ISS as necessary if hyperglycemia persists.
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Pt with labile BP with sedation. Holding atenolol
   in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -start metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally cleared
   -monitor BP closely

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and sedated. The patient has received high volumes of fluid, suggesting possible fluid overload. There are no signs of white blood cell count elevation or fever, making ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) unlikely at this time.

The patient's respiratory failure is expected to improve with the resolution of his metabolic acidosis. He will be diuresed gently with a goal of removing 500-1000cc of fluid. The ventilator settings will be adjusted to decrease respiratory rate and increase tidal volume. Once these changes are made, the patient may be transitioned from controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) to pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is not resolving despite an ERCP procedure. His liver function tests (LFTs) are improving, except for elevated total bilirubin. The patient's anemia is stable, and further investigation is needed if the hemoglobin drops. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diverticulosis, and adenomas, which may contribute to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of pancreatitis, which can lead to infection. Monitoring for signs of infection or VAP is crucial. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Un"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Pt diuresed approx 900cc
   yesterday. Now febrile, with leukocytosis with worsening infiltrates on
   CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). Pt still fluid overloaded on exam
   but given hypernatremia, may be intravascularly depleted in setting of
   infection. [**Month (only) 51**] also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and need to transition him from
   this metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   -Give 500cc-1L D5
 NS to give free water in setting of hypernatremia.
   -Vent settings: will obtain ABG on CPAP/PS [**1-1**] and reassess
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction in setting in increasing T. bili with decreasing LFTs,
   pancreatic necrosis although per surgery, pt would appear much more
   ill. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected
   lines. C. diff less likely without diarrhea. Other causes such as osteo
   or endocarditis are less likely at this time. Sepsis in setting of
   unasyn does not mean he failed unasyn
 if pt has cholangitis with
   obstruction, antibiotic may not have been able to penetrate source of
   infection.
   -ERCP today by GI
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   -Send sputum cx
   -Send C. diff if pt has diarrhea
   -F/u BCx, UCx
   -If no improvement after ERCP, CT abdomen to evaluate for pancreatic
   necrosis
 PO contrast only in setting of ARF.
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   -Fluids as above
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis. T bili remains high despite ERCP although other LFTs are
   decreasing. Concern for cholangitis in setting of fever. Pt had partial
   sphincterotomy with retained stone.
   -Repeat ERCP today.
   -Trend LFTs
   - D/c Unasyn and begin treatment as above
   -TPN vs tube feeds for nutrition
 recs in for both. Will hold TF in
   setting of ERCP and restart pending GI/Surgery recs.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - NGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures qday
   - check ionized calcium q6-q8
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good
   with 100-200 cc/hr overnight. [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly
   depleted vs now septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis,
   pre-renal, ATN given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct decreases
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy as an outpatient
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -start metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   -If BP continues to be elevated on sedation/fentanyl
 will add another
   [**Doctor Last Name **], e.g. hydralazine, increase metoprolol, or change to different
   beta blocker.
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 resolved.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   * DM
 FSBS increased despite TPN. New TPN recs ordered with increased
   insulin dose.
   -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if needed
   after TPN
   -Will adjust ISS as necessary if hyperglycemia persists.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, renal failure, and hypercarbic respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a fever, leukocytosis, worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, and increasing total bilirubin levels, suggesting a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and cholangitis. He also has an elevated blood pressure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible VAP. Treatment options include antibiotic therapy and bronchoscopic procedures.
2. Cholangitis: The patient's increasing total bilirubin levels, along with fever and leukocytosis, suggest a possible cholangitis. ERCP procedure may be necessary for diagnosis and treatment.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a history of renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is crucial.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are low, indicating anemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, which could be related to hemorrhagic pancreatitis or gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and appropriate"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent. Ongoing acidosis (infection and new
   evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.
   Persistent RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton --> VAP.  Would expand
   antimicrobials.  Eventually hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to
   therapy.
   FEVERS -- persistent, now with higher Tm, concern for evolving
   infection.  Concerns include persistent or partially completed
   hepatobiliary infection, and new VAP.  Other considerations include
   line-related infection, C. Diff, or complication of acute pancreatitis
   (ex. pseudocyst).  While on TPN, at risk for fungal infection.  Also
   consider DVT.  Plan check blood, sputum and urine cultures, stool for
   C. Diff, trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.  Would proceed with ABD CT
   scan, and consider repeat ERCP to assess patency of biliary stent.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 prior
   ABG indicates Co2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.  WOuld perform ABD CT scan to assess
   for complications of acute pancreatits.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure --> now may have plateaued.  Unclear
   whether this represents new baseline, or further insult of new
   infection.  Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF repletion, monoitor BUn,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 Improved.  Monitor, replete prn.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable.  Evidence for mild acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains with significant NGT output.  Hold TF.
   Consider TPN if remains intubated and with ileus.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has persistent fever, higher Tm, and a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 39.1°C, heart rate of 89 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/42 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 94% on mechanical ventilation. His lungs show crackles bilaterally and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe. There is no evidence of cyanosis or clubbing. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. Blood glucose levels are elevated, as well as liver enzymes and amylase/lipase levels. Electrolyte imbalances include hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, and hypomagnesemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent. Ongoing acidosis (infection and new
   evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.
   Persistent RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton --> VAP.  Would expand
   antimicrobials.  Eventually hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to
   therapy.
   FEVERS -- persistent, now with higher Tm, concern for evolving
   infection.  Concerns include persistent or partially completed
   hepatobiliary infection, and new VAP.  Other considerations include
   line-related infection, C. Diff, or complication of acute pancreatitis
   (ex. pseudocyst).  While on TPN, at risk for fungal infection.  Also
   consider DVT.  Plan check blood, sputum and urine cultures, stool for
   C. Diff, trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.  Would proceed with ABD CT
   scan, and consider repeat ERCP to assess patency of biliary stent.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 prior
   ABG indicates Co2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.  WOuld perform ABD CT scan to assess
   for complications of acute pancreatits.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure --> now may have plateaued.  Unclear
   whether this represents new baseline, or further insult of new
   infection.  Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF repletion, monoitor BUn,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 Improved.  Monitor, replete prn.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable.  Evidence for mild acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 remains with significant NGT output.  Hold TF.
   Consider TPN if remains intubated and with ileus.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated with an unfavorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI). The patient has recurrent fever, suggesting an evolving infection. There are signs of persistent right lower lobe infiltrate, likely aspiration-related ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's condition is complicated by acute renal failure, possibly due to prerenal azotemia and contrast-induced renal failure. The patient also has a new left bundle branch block (LBBB), stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and a history of diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate, indicating a possible aspiration event leading to VAP. This condition needs to be addressed promptly with expanded antimicrobials and consideration for sedation break and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) once metabolic acidosis improves.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and critical illness, there is a risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and systemic anticoagulation should be considered.
3. Fungal infection: Due to total parenteral nutrition (TPN), the patient is at risk for fungal infection. Monitoring blood cultures and considering"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - resend sputum (although 3 prior inadequate samples); if unsuccessful,
   will consider future bronch with BAL for sample
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill. Pt may also have UTI in
   setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. C. diff also possible
   as is DVT. Other causes such as osteo or endocarditis are less likely
   at this time. Sepsis in setting of unasyn does not mean he failed
   unasyn
 if pt has cholangitis with obstruction, antibiotic may not
   have been able to penetrate source of infection.
   -ERCP yesterday not convincing for biliary source
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   -Send sputum cx
   -Send C. diff if pt has diarrhea
   - empirically treat c diff with po vanc
   -F/u BCx, UCx
   -plan for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis,
   lung consolidation
 PO contrast only in setting of ARF.
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   -Fluids as above
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP yesterday with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs
   - D/c Unasyn and begin treatment as above
   -TPN vs tube feeds for nutrition
 recs in for both. Will hold TF in
   setting of increased abdominal distention and restart pending
   GI/Surgery recs.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium q8
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good.
   [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now septic. DDx
   includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN given
   hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct decreases
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   - New guaiac positive stool likely related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * Thrombocytopenia
 resolved.
   - Continue to trend CBC daily
   .
   * DM
 FSBS increased despite TPN. New TPN recs ordered with increased
   insulin dose.
   -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if needed
   after TPN
   -Will adjust ISS as necessary if hyperglycemia persists.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, and renal failure.
- He is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU.
- The patient has been experiencing fever, increased abdominal distention, and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- He meets the criteria for sepsis due to elevated temperature, white blood cell count, and respiratory rate.
- The patient underwent an ERCP procedure yesterday, which showed multiple erosions in the stomach possibly due to nasogastric tube trauma and severe edema of the duodenum.
- A new biliary stent was placed during the ERCP.
- The patient's laboratory results show hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, renal failure, and elevated levels of lactate and D-dimer.
- The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit, but there is concern for dilutional or hemorrhagic causes.
- His blood pressure is elevated, which may be due to pain or sedation.
- The patient has a history of COPD, but is retaining CO2 at baseline and is unable to compensate for metabolic acidosis.
- He has left bundle branch block (LBBB) with negative cardiac enzymes, suggesting less likelihood of acute ischemia.
- Thrombocytopenia has resolved.
- The patient has diabetes mellitus with fasting blood sugar levels increased despite total"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis, worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, and a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also meets SIRS criteria for sepsis and has multiple possible sources of infection including VAP, cholangitis, or continued obstruction. The patient's potassium levels are low, and he has hypernatremia. He is being treated with antibiotics, and further diagnostic tests are planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's febrile response, leukocytosis, and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest a possible VAP. This condition is a common complication in patients who are intubated for an extended period.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria for sepsis, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. With multiple possible sources of infection, there is a high risk of sepsis progressing to septic shock.
3. Cholangitis: The patient's high levels of total bilirubin and liver function tests, along with the presence of gallstones, suggest cholangitis. If not treated promptly, it can lead to severe complications such as sepsis or organ failure.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancre"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent. Ongoing acidosis (infection and new
   evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.
   Persistent RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton --> VAP --> now on expanded
   antimicrobials.  Eventually hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to
   therapy.
    FEVERS -- persistent, now with higher Tm, concern for evolving
   infection.  Attributed to VAP, but new concern for possible C. diff.
   No evidence for new hepatobiliary infection.  Other considerations
   include line-related infection, or complication of acute pancreatitis
   (ex. pseudocyst).  While on TPN, at risk for fungal infection.  Also
   consider DVT.  Plan check blood, sputum and urine cultures, stool for
   C. Diff, trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.  ERCP without new findings, and
   biliary ducts draining, with sludge.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 prior
   ABG indicates Co2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.  Plan ABD CT scan to assess for
   complications of acute pancreatits.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure --> now may have plateaued.  Unclear
   whether this represents new baseline, or further insult of new
   infection.  Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF repletion, monoitor BUn,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 Improved.  Monitor, replete prn.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable.  Evidence for mild acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TPN.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. He is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to persistent underlying COPD and an evolving infection. The patient also has persistent fevers, likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and is on expanded antimicrobials. There is a concern for Clostridium difficile infection as well. Other potential sources of infection include line-related infections, complications of acute pancreatitis (such as pseudocysts), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and fungal infection related to total parenteral nutrition (TPN). The patient's acidosis is a result of mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic causes. Acute renal failure is likely prerenal azotemia with superimposed contrast dye-induced renal failure. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored, and he should continue to receive IV fluids for resuscitation. Hypocalcemia has improved but should be monitored and repleted as necessary. The patient has a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) without symptoms of chest pain, which can be followed up as an outpatient. His COPD is stable but may have experienced a mild acute exacerbation. TPN should continue for nutritional support. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2 (NIDDM) should be monitored, keeping glucose levels below 150. Overall, the patient's condition remains critical."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with severe gallstone pancreatitis with a profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Persistent. Ongoing acidosis (infection and new
   evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.
   Persistent RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton --> VAP --> now on expanded
   antimicrobials.  Eventually hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to
   therapy.
    FEVERS -- persistent, now with higher Tm, concern for evolving
   infection.  Attributed to VAP, but new concern for possible C. diff.
   No evidence for new hepatobiliary infection.  Other considerations
   include line-related infection, or complication of acute pancreatitis
   (ex. pseudocyst).  While on TPN, at risk for fungal infection.  Also
   consider DVT.  Plan check blood, sputum and urine cultures, stool for
   C. Diff, trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.  ERCP without new findings, and
   biliary ducts draining, with sludge.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 prior
   ABG indicates Co2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase. Continue IVF resuscitation, monitor bladder pressure.
   Continue empirical antibiotics.  Plan ABD CT scan to assess for
   complications of acute pancreatits.
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now superimposed
   contrast dye-induced renal failure --> now may have plateaued.  Unclear
   whether this represents new baseline, or further insult of new
   infection.  Check urinalysis.  Continue IVF repletion, monoitor BUn,
   creatinine.
   FLUIDS -- continue net volume resusitation.  Monitor I/O.  Monitor CVP,
   maintain >10 cm H2O.
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 Improved.  Monitor, replete prn.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable.  Evidence for mild acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT
 continue TPN.
   NIDDM --  monitor glucose, maintain <150.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a persistent right lower lobe infiltrate, likely due to aspiration pneumonia (VAP), for which expanded antimicrobials have been initiated. The patient's fevers have persisted, and there is concern for evolving infection, possibly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Other potential sources of infection include line-related infection, acute pancreatitis complications, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient's mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis is being managed with mechanical ventilation. Acute renal failure is suspected, and ongoing fluid resuscitation and monitoring of renal function are planned. The patient's acute pancreatitis is attributed to gallstones, and ERCP with stone extraction, pus removal, and stent placement has been performed. Nutritional support via total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is ongoing, and the patient's other medical conditions, including COPD, diabetes mellitus, and left bundle branch block (LBBB), are being managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's persistent right lower lobe infiltrate suggests the possibility of VAP. This can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially systemic infection.

   CXR [**2153-9-22**]:
   There has been interval resolution of the right-sided pleural
   effusion and atelectasis. There has also been improvement on the left;
   however, there is residual atelectasis of the left lower lobe, and
   probably a
   small left-sided pleural effusion. The remainder of the left lung is
   clear.
   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes such as osteo or
   endocarditis are less likely at this time. Sepsis in setting of unasyn
   does not mean he failed unasyn
 if pt has cholangitis with
   obstruction, antibiotic may not have been able to penetrate source of
   infection.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - D/c PO Vanco as pt is C diff negative
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including COPD, pancreatitis, renal failure, and diabetes. He is currently admitted to the ICU for hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. 

The patient's recent progress notes indicate that he is febrile with leukocytosis and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, which raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has elevated abdominal pressures and metabolic acidosis. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), with possible sources of infection including VAP, cholangitis, pancreatic necrosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or infected lines. 

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis has been treated with an ERCP, which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis. He had a partial sphincterotomy with retained stone, and another ERCP was performed with old stent removal and new stent placement. The patient's abdomen was grossly distended after the procedure, but the abdominal exam improved after placing the OG on suction, and there is no suspicion of obstruction as the patient had stool output. 

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is characterized by increased creatinine levels, but the urine output is good (80-100 cc/hr). The differential diagnosis includes third spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, or acute tubular necrosis (ATN) given hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - resend sputum (although 3 prior inadequate samples); if unsuccessful,
   will consider future bronch with BAL for sample
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill. Pt may also have UTI in
   setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. C. diff also possible
   as is DVT. Other causes such as osteo or endocarditis are less likely
   at this time. Sepsis in setting of unasyn does not mean he failed
   unasyn
 if pt has cholangitis with obstruction, antibiotic may not
   have been able to penetrate source of infection.
   -ERCP yesterday not convincing for biliary source
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   -Send sputum cx
   -Send C. diff if pt has diarrhea
   - empirically treat c diff with po vanc
   -F/u BCx, UCx
   -plan for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for pancreatic necrosis,
   lung consolidation
 PO contrast only in setting of ARF.
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   -Fluids as above
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP yesterday with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs
   - D/c Unasyn and begin treatment as above
   -TPN vs tube feeds for nutrition
 recs in for both. Will hold TF in
   setting of increased abdominal distention and restart pending
   GI/Surgery recs.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium q8
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr trending downwards. UOP is good.
   [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now septic. DDx
   includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN given
   hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Pt receiving lots of fluids so this may be
   dilutional. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and
   peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be due to
   gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less likely. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.
   - Repeat CT abdomen if Hct decreases
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   - New guaiac positive stool likely related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * DM
 FSBS increased despite TPN. New TPN recs ordered with increased
   insulin dose.
   -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if needed
   after TPN
   -Will adjust ISS as necessary if hyperglycemia persists.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. 

Summary of the patient's health progress:
- The patient has a fever of 101.6°F and leukocytosis with worsening infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to elevated temperature, white blood cell count, and respiratory rate, along with multiple possible sources of infection including VAP, cholangitis, or continued obstruction.
- The patient had gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, which showed a retained stone. Another ERCP was performed with stent placement.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with decreasing creatinine levels. There is concern for intravascular volume depletion, pre-renal azotemia, or acute tubular necrosis.
- The patient has anemia with a stable hematocrit level. There is concern for dilutional anemia due to fluid administration, hemolysis, or hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
- The patient has hypertension with elevated blood pressure readings. This may be due to pain or stress.
- The patient has a history of COPD and is unable to breathe off CO2, leading to hypercarbic respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, Acute on CRF, and respiratory failure in setting
   of severe gallstone pancreatitis c/b profound metabolic acidosis and
   hypocalcemia with ongoing fevers.
   Issues include:
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Multifactorial in setting of ongoing metabolic
   acidosis (evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD,
   distended abd, and RLL infiltrate concerning for VAP.
         Continue ACV, monitor ABG, maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.
   Continue broadened antibx coverage and f/u cx data.  Consider wean/SBT
   once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to therapy.
   # FEVERS/leukocytosis
fever curve trending down.  Likely [**2-26**] VAP
   though broad ddx has been considered including-- C. diff neg, LENis neg
   for LE clot, osteo and SBE low on ddx. Repeat ercp less convincing for
   recurrent biliary source.  Other considerations include line-infection
   (no growth from blood cx sent from line), complication of acute
   pancreatitis (ex. pseudocyst, though not evident on ct abd), and fungal
   infection given TPN.
   Continue empiric antbx.  Given neg c diff  cx, can d/c po vanco.
   Continue to trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.
   # ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
with
   h/o chronic CO2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   # GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS -- s/p ERCP with extraction of stones, pus and
   stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and amylase/lipase.  Monitor bladder
   pressure in setting of abd distention and aggressive fluids.  F/u
   additional surgical and Gi recommendations.
   #ABD DISTENSION
probable partial ileus.  Continue to hold TFs, OGT for
   decompressions, follow bladder pressures and serial exam.
   # HYPOCALCEMIA
 has improved.  Replete prn.
   # ACUTE on chronic RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now w/
   superimposed contrast dye-induced renal failure --> cr may have
   plateaued at new baseline vs remains elevated [**2-26**] additional insult
   from ongoing/evolving infection.  Continue IVF repletion, follow u/o,
   avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and ongoing fevers. The patient's condition is multifactorial, including ongoing infection, renal failure, underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), abdominal distension, and hypothermia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure due to a combination of factors such as metabolic acidosis, underlying COPD, abdominal distension, and a right lower lobe infiltrate concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient will require continued assisted ventilation and broadened antibiotic coverage.

2. Fevers/Leukocytosis: The patient has persistent fevers and leukocytosis, which could be attributed to various causes including VAP, line infection, acute pancreatitis, or fungal infection. Further investigations are needed to determine the exact source of infection.

3. Acidosis: The patient is experiencing mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis due to acute renal failure, infection, and chronic COPD. Mechanical ventilation will be continued to compensate for the acidosis.

4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, and an ERCP procedure was performed to extract stones, pus, and stent placement. Monitoring of liver"

   all contributing to ongoing need for vent support.  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG
 maintain pH 7.30-7.35, pCO2= 50.  Persistent
   RLL infiltrate, likley aspiraton --> VAP --> now on expanded
   antimicrobials.  Eventually hope to work towards SBT and extubation
   trial once metabolic acidosis improves/resolves and VAP responds to
   therapy.
   FEVERS --Concern for evolving infection.  Attributed to VAP, C. diff
   neg, LENis neg for leg clot, osteo and SBE low on ddx. Repeat ercp less
   convincing for recurrent biliary source.  Other considerations include
   line-related infection (no growth from blood cx sent from line, or
   complication of acute pancreatitis (ex. pseudocyst), though not evident
   on ct abd.  While on TPN, at risk for fungal infection.
   Continue empiric antbx pending neg cx work up.  Given neg c diff can
   d/c po vanco. trend LFTs and amylase/lipase.
   ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
 prior
   ABG indicates Co2 retention.  Acute metabolic acidosis with a small gap
   in the setting of acute pancreatitis and cholangitis.  Maintain
   mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate
   ACUTE PANCREATITIS -- attributed to gallstones.  s/p ERCP with
   extraction of stones, pus and stent placement.  Monitor LFTs and
   amylase/lipase.  Monitor bladder pressure.  F/u additional surgical and
   Gi recommendations
   HYPOCALCEMIA
 Improved.  Monitor, replete prn.
   ACUTE on chronic RENAL FAILURE -- likely prerenal azotemia and now
   superimposed contrast dye-induced renal failure --> now may have
   plateaued at new baseline vs additional insul from infection.  Continue
   IVF repletion, monoitor Bun, creatinine.  Avloid nephrotoxins and
   renally dose meds.
   LBBB -- New since [**2150**]. No symptoms of chest pain. Can follow up with
   stress as outpatient.
   COPD -- Stable.  Evidence for mild acute exacerbation.  Continue MDI's.

   CXR [**9-22**]:
   There has been interval resolution of the right-sided pleural
   effusion and atelectasis. There has also been improvement on the left;
   however, there is residual atelectasis of the left lower lobe, and
   probably a
   small left-sided pleural effusion. The remainder of the left lung is
   clear.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with worsening infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes such as osteo or
   endocarditis are less likely at this time. Sepsis in setting of unasyn
   does not mean he failed unasyn
 if pt has cholangitis with
   obstruction, antibiotic may not have been able to penetrate source of
   infection.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - s/p PO Vanco as pt is C diff negative
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - D/c Unasyn and begin treatment as above
   -TPN vs tube feeds for nutrition
 recs in for both. Will hold TF in
   setting of increased abdominal distention and restart pending
   GI/Surgery recs.
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now
   septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
 not commented on in prelim CT read but no IV
   contrast given so may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less
   likely. Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices. New guaiac positive stool likely related to stomach ersions
   seen on ERCP from OG trauma
   -F/u final CT chest/[**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if
   needed after adjustments made in TPN

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a complex medical history and current health issues. The patient has hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, renal failure, sepsis, gallstone pancreatitis, anemia, hypertension, COPD, left bundle branch block (LBBB), and diabetes mellitus.

The patient is currently intubated and sedated, indicating respiratory failure. He is also febrile with leukocytosis and worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's elevated abdominal pressures and metabolic acidosis require careful monitoring and management.

The patient meets the criteria for sepsis due to temperature elevation, white blood cell count increase, and respiratory rate increase. Multiple possible sources of infection are present, including VAP, cholangitis, continued obstruction, pancreatic necrosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and bacteremia or infected lines. C. difficile infection has been ruled out.

The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP procedure with partial sphincterotomy and stent placement. His abdominal exam improved after placing the orogastric tube on suction, and he has been producing stool output.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is characterized by an increase in creatinine levels, but his urine output is good. The differential diagnosis includes third spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN).

   There has been interval resolution of the right-sided pleural

   probably a
   small left-sided pleural effusion. The remainder of the left lung is
   clear.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes include sinusitis, osteo or
   endocarditis.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend C diff (although negx1) and empirically start tx with IV
   flagyl
   - adding on diff to WBC
   - plan for CT sinus, KUB and RUQ ultrasound to eval for sinusitis,
   bowel obstruction or cholecystitis/obstruction
   - low threshold for changing his central and arterial lines if no
   source found although line infection seems unlikely given neg cx
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   -continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now
   septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
 not commented on in prelim CT read but no IV
   contrast given so may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less
   likely. Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices.  Likely related to stomach ersions seen on ERCP from OG trauma
   -F/u final CT chest/[**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status- Patient is +16L for length of stay and has had elevated
   pressures, edema on exam.  Will start gentle diuresis with 10mg lasix
   IV x1 for goal diuresis of -500cc today.
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if
   needed after adjustments made in TPN

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and sedated, not arousable to voice. The patient has been febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has elevated abdominal pressures and metabolic acidosis that requires respiratory compensation. Other potential sources of infection include cholangitis, pancreatic necrosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), and bacteremia or infected lines. The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with partial sphincterotomy and retained stone. He is on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and has acute-on-chronic renal failure with increased creatinine. There is concern for anemia, possibly due to hemorrhagic pancreatitis or gastrointestinal bleeding from gastritis or peptic ulcer disease. The patient has fluid overload and hypertension, and his COPD exacerbation is complicated by the inability to breathe off CO2. He also has left bundle branch block (LBBB) with negative cardiac enzymes. The patient has diabetes mellitus (DM) and is on insulin coverage in the hospital. ICU care includes TPN without lipids, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The main concerns include hypercarbic respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, renal failure, sepsis, anemia, hypertension, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). 

The patient's current condition shows fever, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, and elevated abdominal pressures. These findings suggest the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and sepsis. 

The patient's recent history includes gallstone pancreatitis, for which an ERCP was performed, but a stone was retained. Another ERCP was done with stent placement and improvement in abdominal exam. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, lipase, amylase, and D-dimer. The patient's electrolytes are also abnormal, with low potassium, sodium, and magnesium levels. 

The patient's vital signs show elevated temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. The respiratory rate is high, likely due to COPD and the need to compensate for metabolic acidosis. Oxygen saturation is 94% on ventilator support. 

Physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, soft distended abdomen, 2+ hand edema, cold feet, and positive deep tendon reflexes. 

The patient's medical history includes COPD, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypertension,"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with acute on CRF and respiratory failure in setting of severe
   gallstone pancreatitis c/b profound metabolic acidosis and
   hypocalcemia, VAP on empiric broad coverage, with ongoing fevers and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   Primary issues include:
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Multifactorial in setting of metabolic acidosis
   (evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD, distended abd,
   and VAP.
         Continue ACV, monitor ABG, Continue broad empiric antibx coverage
   to complete course, as Infiltrates are now improving on f/u cxr.  At
   this time, on broad antibx, utility of bronch bal would be very low.
   Not currently candidate for wean/sbt.  Intubated for 1 wk, will begin
   to address issue of possible trach with pt family.
   # FEVERS/leukocytosis
concerned for evolving infection, with unclear
   source.  Initially attributed to VAP but persists despite broad empiric
   antibx.  Now improvement in pulm Infiltrates, stable O2 requirements,
   and no further increase or change in sputum.  Broad ddx considered
   including-- C. diff, clot, SBE, osteo, biliary obstruction/acalculous
   chole, complication from pancreatitis, and line infection, fungal inf
   given tpn.  C-diff cx neg, LENis neg for LE clot, osteo and SBE low on
   ddx. Repeat ercp less convincing for recurrent biliary source and ct
   abd without evidence of pseudocyst, necrosis, or loculated pleural
   process. Lactate remains normal, no skin breakdown, or rash
   --CT sinus,
   --repeat c diff cx and restart empiric treatment (flagyl),
   --repeat ruq u/s,
   --send diff,
   --Check kub,
   --Consider drug fever, though temps started prior to initiation of
   antibx and would not likely explain leukocytosis.
   --Consider line changes, noting in X 1 wk and no pos blood cxs to date
   --Continue empiric antbx.
   # ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
with
   h/o chronic CO2 retention.
   --Continue mechanical ventilation to more effectively compensate.
   --Follow lactate
   # GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS -- s/p ERCP with extraction of stones, pus and
   stent placement.
   --Monitor LFTs and amylase/lipase.
   --Monitor bladder pressure in setting of abd distention and aggressive
   fluids.
   --additional surgical and Gi recommendations.
   ---Repeat ruq ultrasound as at risk for acalulous chole.
   #ABD DISTENSION
probable ileus.  Urine oupt adequate and renal fx
   holding stable
   --Continue to hold TFs,
   --OGT for decompressions
   --follow bladder pressures
   --serial exam.
   -- KUB.
   # ACUTE on chronic RENAL FAILURE -- cr may have plateaued at new
   baseline vs remains elevated [**2-26**] additional insult from
   ongoing/evolving infection.  Urine outpt adequate
   --avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds.
   --attempt very gentle diuresis
   # altered consiousness

   Addendum:
   I spoke with pts wife, granddaughter and daughter and updated them as
   to his current condition and treatment plans.  All questions were
   answered.  Family understands that pt has had decline given increasing
   wbc and continued fevers, though at present he remains hemodynamically
   stable without excalation of oxygen requirements.  Family informed that
   we are aggressively evaluating for possible infection given his
   continued leukocytosis and fevers with unclear etiology.  We discussed
   w/u to date and plans for sinus ct, empiric c diff treatment with
   repeat c diff cx, and repeat ruq u/s.  Discussed likely changing lines
   if these studies are unrevealing, though lines are 1 wk old and bl cx
   have been neg.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with acute on chronic renal failure and respiratory failure in the setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis, complicated by profound metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia. The patient is currently receiving broad empiric antibiotic coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), with ongoing fevers and worsening leukocytosis.

The patient's primary issues include:
1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE: Multifactorial in setting of metabolic acidosis (evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD, distended abdomen, and VAP. Continue airway protection, monitor ABG, continue broad empiric antibx coverage to complete course, as infiltrates are now improving on follow-up chest X-ray. The utility of a bronchial blocker would be very low at this time. The patient is not currently a candidate for weaning/sedation. Intubated for 1 week, the issue of possible tracheostomy will be addressed with the patient's family.

2. FEVERS/LEUKOCYTOISIS: Concerned for evolving infection, with unclear source. Initially attributed to VAP but persists despite broad empiric antibx. Now, there is an improvement in pulmonary infiltrates, stable oxygen requirements, and no further increase or change in sputum.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, respiratory failure, and severe gallstone pancreatitis. He has profound metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia. The patient has been febrile, with ongoing fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. He also has leukocytosis and is suspected to have ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's respiratory function is supported by mechanical ventilation, and he is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infection. He has abdominal distension, likely due to a partial ileus, and his renal function is compromised. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including ongoing metabolic acidosis, evolving infection, underlying COPD, distended abdomen, and right lower lobe infiltrate concerning for VAP. Continuous aerosolized bronchodilators and weaning off mechanical ventilation should be considered once metabolic acidosis improves and VAP responds to therapy.
2. FEVERS/Leukocytosis: The patient continues to have fevers with an unclear source, despite broad empiric antibiotic coverage. Broad differential diagnoses have been considered, including C. difficile infection, line infection, complication of acute pancreatitis, fungal infection, and drug"

   suggestion
   of gallbladder distention that would suggest acute cholecystitis.
   2. Diffusely coarsened and echogenic liver consistent with fatty
   infiltration. Hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on the
   basis of
   imaging studies.
   3. Trace perihepatic ascites, as seen on recent CT.
   CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2153-9-23**]):
   1. Mild mucosal thickening of scattered paranasal sinuses, likely

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes include sinusitis, osteo or
   endocarditis.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend C diff (although negx1) and empirically start tx with IV
   flagyl
   - adding on diff to WBC
   - plan for CT sinus, KUB and RUQ ultrasound to eval for sinusitis,
   bowel obstruction or cholecystitis/obstruction
   - low threshold for changing his central and arterial lines if no
   source found although line infection seems unlikely given neg cx
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   -continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now
   septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
 not commented on in prelim CT read but no IV
   contrast given so may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less
   likely. Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices.  Likely related to stomach ersions seen on ERCP from OG trauma
   -F/u final CT chest/[**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status- Patient is +16L for length of stay and has had elevated
   pressures, edema on exam.  Will start gentle diuresis with 10mg lasix
   IV x1 for goal diuresis of -500cc today.
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if
   needed after adjustments made in TPN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, renal failure, and other comorbidities. He is currently intubated in the ICU due to hypercarbic respiratory failure and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by various medical issues including suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), sepsis, gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypertension, left bundle branch block (LBBB), and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's recent progress includes the development of a fever with a temperature of 102.5°F, leukocytosis with a WBC count of 25.2K/uL, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which are concerning for VAP. He also has signs of sepsis with elevated inflammatory markers and multiple possible sources of infection such as VAP, cholangitis, or a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's renal function has worsened with an increase in serum creatinine levels.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for gallstone pancreatitis, but the procedure revealed a retained stone. The patient's abdominal exam showed improvement after placing an orogastric tube (OGT) on suction, suggesting no obstruction. However, the patient continues to have elevated abdominal pressures and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's anemia is"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also
   received fluids and may have some pulmonary edema, now s/p gental
   diuresis. Barriers to extubation include weakness and need to
   transition him from this metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD, will
   increase PEEP to 10 to assist ventilation.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP
   not convincing for biliary source. Other causes include sinusitis,
   osteo or endocarditis.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend another C diff (although negxx) and empirically start tx
   with IV flagyl
   - plan for CT sinus, KUB and RUQ ultrasound to eval for sinusitis,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition:

1. Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and requires ventilator support. He also has metabolic acidosis, which needs to be corrected.

2. Sepsis: The patient meets the criteria for sepsis, as indicated by fever, elevated white blood cell count, and increased respiratory rate. Possible sources of infection include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), cholangitis, bowel obstruction, pancreatic necrosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, or infected lines. Empiric antibiotics have been started, and further investigations are planned.

3. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to gallstone obstructive pancreatitis. There was a partial sphincterotomy with retained stone. Another ERCP was performed with old stent removal and new stent placement. The patient's abdomen was grossly distended afterward, but the abdominal exam improved after placing the oral gastric tube on suction. Trend LFTs and total bilirubin levels are advised.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased again, but urine output is good. He may have become intravascularly depleted or septic."

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Limited examination, including not unanticipated non-visualization
   of the
   gallbladder, which was recently filled with air on CT. However, no
   suggestion
   of gallbladder distention that would suggest acute cholecystitis.
   2. Diffusely coarsened and echogenic liver consistent with fatty
   infiltration. Hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on the
   basis of
   imaging studies.
   3. Trace perihepatic ascites, as seen on recent CT.
   CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2153-9-23**]):
   1. Mild mucosal thickening of scattered paranasal sinuses, likely
   related to
   intubation rather than sinusitis.
   2. Opacification of scattered mastoid air cells, with a few air-fluid
   levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes include sinusitis, osteo or
   endocarditis.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend C diff (although negx1) and empirically start tx with IV
   flagyl
   - adding on diff to WBC
   - plan for CT sinus, KUB and RUQ ultrasound to eval for sinusitis,
   bowel obstruction or cholecystitis/obstruction
   - low threshold for changing his central and arterial lines if no
   source found although line infection seems unlikely given neg cx
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   -continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now
   septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
 not commented on in prelim CT read but no IV
   contrast given so may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less
   likely. Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices.  Likely related to stomach ersions seen on ERCP from OG trauma
   -F/u final CT chest/[**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks

   * Fluid status- Patient is +16L for length of stay and has had elevated
   pressures, edema on exam.  Will start gentle diuresis with 10mg lasix
   IV x1 for goal diuresis of -500cc today.

   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI

 -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if
   needed after adjustments made in TPN

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, renal failure, and other medical conditions. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's current health issues include hypercarbic respiratory failure, sepsis, gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypertension, left bundle branch block (LBBB), and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infection, and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He meets SIRS criteria for sepsis, which may be due to various sources including VAP, cholangitis, pancreatic necrosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), bacteremia, or infected lines. Empiric antibiotic treatment has been initiated.

The patient also has evidence of gallstone pancreatitis, as indicated by imaging studies and ERCP findings. He had a partial sphincterotomy with retained stone, and another ERCP was performed with old stent removal/new stent placement. The abdominal exam improved after placing the OG on suction, and there is no suspicion of obstruction since the patient has stool output.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is being managed by maintaining urine output and trending creatinine levels. The patient is also anemic, with a stable hematocrit level. There is a concern for hemolysis, but haptoglobin is"

   IMGAGING:
   Liver and gallbladder US ([**2153-9-23**]):
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Limited examination, including not unanticipated non-visualization
   of the
   gallbladder, which was recently filled with air on CT. However, no
   suggestion
   of gallbladder distention that would suggest acute cholecystitis.
   2. Diffusely coarsened and echogenic liver consistent with fatty
   infiltration. Hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on the
   basis of
   imaging studies.
   3. Trace perihepatic ascites, as seen on recent CT.
   CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2153-9-23**]):
   1. Mild mucosal thickening of scattered paranasal sinuses, likely
   related to
   intubation rather than sinusitis.
   2. Opacification of scattered mastoid air cells, with a few air-fluid
   levels.
   KUB portable ([**2153-9-23**]):
   Nonspecific and nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
   CXR ([**2153-9-24**]): (my read): stable babasilar atelectasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Metabolic acidosis was improving and we were
   trying to transition to pt
s baseline. Now febrile, with leukocytosis
   with bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**]
   also have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Has also now
   received fluids again and may have some pulmonary edema. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - F/u sputum
   - Sedation to make pt more comfortable
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Also
   with multiple possible sources, including VAP, Cholangitis or continued
   obstruction (although not seen on ERCP), pancreatic necrosis although
   per surgery, pt would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT
   [**Last Name (un) **] prelim read. Pt may also have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia
   or infected lines. C. diff negative and LENI negative for DVT. ERCP not
   convincing for biliary source. Other causes include sinusitis, osteo or
   endocarditis.
   -Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend C diff (although negx1) and empirically start tx with IV
   flagyl
   - adding on diff to WBC
   - plan for CT sinus, KUB and RUQ ultrasound to eval for sinusitis,
   bowel obstruction or cholecystitis/obstruction
   - low threshold for changing his central and arterial lines if no
   source found although line infection seems unlikely given neg cx
   -F/u BCx, UCx, sputum
   -F/u final read for CT chest/abdomen/pelvis
   -Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained stone.  Had
   another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent placement with
   grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam improved after placing
   OG on suction and do not suspect obstruction as pt had stool output.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   -continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). [**Month (only) 51**] may have become intravascularly depleted vs now
   septic. DDx includes 3^rd spacing from pancreatitis, pre-renal, ATN
   given hypotensive episdoes.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable today. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Also considered
   hemorrhagic pancreatitis
 not commented on in prelim CT read but no IV
   contrast given so may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Aorto-enteric fistula less
   likely. Other possible sources include diverticular bleed given known
   diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of
   varices.  Likely related to stomach ersions seen on ERCP from OG trauma
   -F/u final CT chest/[**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status- Patient is +16L for length of stay and has had elevated
   pressures, edema on exam.  Will start gentle diuresis with 10mg lasix
   IV x1 for goal diuresis of -500cc today.
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   -continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   -Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   -Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * LBBB
 CE negative x3. In absence of chest discomfort or enzyme bump
   think less likely to have acute ischemia. Unfortunately there is no EKG
   in our system since [**2150**] so the timing of the LBBB development is
   uncertain. He does report symptoms concerning for stable angina
   - repeat outpatient stress
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Continue ASA while r/o MI
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents and cover with insulin in hospital if
   needed after adjustments made in TPN

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has developed fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has sepsis, likely due to multiple sources such as VAP, cholangitis, or pancreatic necrosis. Other possible causes include sinusitis, osteomyelitis, or endocarditis. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis has been treated with ERCP, but there is a concern for ongoing obstruction. He is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypertension, and left bundle branch block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate the possibility of VAP. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and lead to sepsis.
2. Sepsis: With multiple potential sources of infection, including VAP, cholangitis, or pancreatic necrosis, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis. This condition can progress rapidly and be life-threatening.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and good urine output suggest an acute deterioration in renal function. This could be due to factors such as hyp"

   IMGAGING:
   Liver and gallbladder US ([**2153-9-23**]):
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Limited examination, including not unanticipated non-visualization
   of the
   gallbladder, which was recently filled with air on CT. However, no
   suggestion
   of gallbladder distention that would suggest acute cholecystitis.
   2. Diffusely coarsened and echogenic liver consistent with fatty
   infiltration. Hepatic cirrhosis/fibrosis cannot be excluded on the
   basis of
   imaging studies.
   3. Trace perihepatic ascites, as seen on recent CT.
   CT SINUS/MANDIBLE/MAXILLOFACIAL W/O CONTRAST ([**2153-9-23**]):
   1. Mild mucosal thickening of scattered paranasal sinuses, likely
   related to
   intubation rather than sinusitis.
   2. Opacification of scattered mastoid air cells, with a few air-fluid
   levels.
   KUB portable ([**2153-9-23**]):
   Nonspecific and nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.
   CXR ([**2153-9-24**]): (my read): stable babasilar atelectasis.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   .
   # Hypercarbic repiratory failure
 Pt with h/o COPD and continued
   ventilator requirement. Pt has anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely
   secondary to uremia. Increasing PEEP to 10 and Vt to 480 didn
t improve
   acidosis.  Now febrile, with leukocytosis with bilateral infiltrates on
   CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**] also have atelectasis from
   increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to extubation include weakness
   and need to transition him from this metabolic acidosis to his
   baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   tomorrow
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. C. diff negative x2 and
   LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out sinusitis.  Endocarditis and
   osteo remains on the differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - TTE today
   - change lines today (CVL and A-line)
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs and T. bili
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - f/u urine eos
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider renal consult
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status: pt appears euvolemic.
   - keep Is and Os even today
   .
   * HTN
 BP elevated. Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or
   sedation/fentanyl decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   ..
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN.
   - insulin drip if can give through CVL or can get a PIV

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and sedated, with no response to voice. He has hypercarbic respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, and sepsis. The patient also has gallstone pancreatitis with ongoing abdominal distention despite initial improvement after OGT placement. There is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient has an elevated white blood cell count. He is also experiencing anemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Fluid status appears euvolemic, and the patient has a history of diverticulosis and colon cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's elevated white blood cell count, fever, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of VAP. Treatment includes increasing PEEP to 10 and Vt to 480, and starting empiric antibiotic therapy.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output. Causes of AKI include acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Treatment involves maintaining urine output >30 cc/hr, monitoring central venous pressure (CVP), and consulting a nephrologist.
3. Sepsis: The patient meets sepsis criteria due to temperature"

   83 yo M with acute on CRF and respiratory failure in setting of severe
   gallstone pancreatitis c/b profound metabolic acidosis and
   hypocalcemia, VAP on empiric broad coverage, with ongoing fevers and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis
          Met acidosis (GAP, NG)
          Resp failure
          Abd distention
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 Multifactorial in setting of metabolic acidosis
   (evolving infection, renal failure), underlying COPD, distended abd,
   and VAP.
         Continue ACV, monitor ABG, Continue broad empiric antibx coverage
   to complete course, as Infiltrates are now improving on f/u cxr.  At
   this time, on broad antibx, utility of bronch bal would be very low.
   Not currently candidate for wean/sbt.  Intubated for 1 wk, will begin
   to address issue of possible trach with pt family.
   # FEVERS/leukocytosis/Sepsis
concerned for evolving infection, with
   unclear source.  Initially attributed to VAP but persists despite broad
   empiric antibx.  Stable O2 requirements, and no further increase or
   change in sputum.  Broad ddx considered including-- C. diff, clot, SBE,
   osteo, biliary obstruction/acalculous chole, complication from
   pancreatitis, and line infection, fungal inf given tpn.  C-diff cx neg
   X2, LENis neg for LE clot (though would not contribute to leukocytosis
   and such high temps), osteo and SBE low on ddx. Repeat ercp less
   convincing for recurrent biliary source and ct abd without evidence of
   pseudocyst, necrosis, or loculated pleural process/infected effusion.
   Lactate remains normal, min skin breakdown, no rash, CT sinuses less
   concernign for sinutiisit, KUB without obstruction, lfts a/l continue
   to iprove. No evidene of [**Last Name (un) 9738**] chole
   Will continue broad empiric VAP coverage, will treat empirically with
   iv flagyl for high concern for c diff despite neg cx.  Given ileus
   unclear regarding vanco absorption).  Will change out lines today
   (though has had no pos cxs and site appear clean) and obtain TTE to
   assess veggies, thouygh relatively [**Name2 (NI) 9739**] for SBE given neg bl
   cx and no other SBE stigmate.
   --repeat c diff cx and restart empiric treatment (flagyl),
   --repeat ruq u/s,
   --send diff,
   --Check kub,
   --Consider drug fever, though temps started prior to initiation of
   antibx and would not likely explain leukocytosis.
   --Consider line changes, noting in X 1 wk and no pos blood cxs to date
   --Continue empiric antbx.
   # ACIDOSIS -- mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis
   (acute renal failure and infection).  Known COPD with poor FEV1
with
   h/o chronic CO2 retention.   Continues to worsen slowly.  Becoming more
   limited in ability to compensate with vent.
   --Continue mechanical ventilation follow abgs. Can try slight increase
   in TV and peep to recruit and assist further with compensatory
   ventilation.
   --Follow lactates
   # GALLSTONE PANCREATITIS -- s/p ERCP with extraction of stones, pus and
   stent placement.
   --Monitor LFTs and amylase/lipase
which continue to trend down

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of acute on chronic renal failure and respiratory failure due to severe gallstone pancreatitis. He presents with profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has ongoing fevers and worsening leukocytosis. He is currently on broad empiric antibiotic coverage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and unclear source of infection raise concern for sepsis. Initial VAP treatment has been administered, but the infection persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis due to renal failure and infection. His ability to compensate with the ventilator is becoming limited.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including evolving infection, underlying COPD, abdominal distention, and VAP. He will continue with assisted ventilation and close monitoring of ABG results.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. C-difficile has been ruled out.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have plateaued at a new baseline or remain elevated. Ongoing infection may contribute to further renal dysfunction.
6. Abdominal Distention: The patient's abdominal distention is likely"

   evaluation, we have been unable to identify a clear etiology/source.
   Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis for functional recovery.
    Agree with plan to continue ACV. We will attempt to better compensate

The patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis, acute-on-chronic renal failure, acute respiratory failure, and severe gallstone pancreatitis. He is experiencing profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, and abdominal distention/ileus. The patient requires full ventilator support and is not a candidate for weaning or spontaneous breathing trials.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including inability to compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis, sepsis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), distended abdomen, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to an ongoing infection, which can lead to further systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.
2. Acidosis (AGMA): The patient has mixed chronic respiratory and acute metabolic acidosis. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to worsening respiratory failure and multiorgan dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure requires ongoing full ventilator support. If the ventilator settings are not optimized or if there is a progression of respiratory failure, the patient may not be able to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, and abd
   distention/ileus.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis
          Acidosis (AGMA)
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of  sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  Despite that his gallstone pancreatitis is improving without
   evidence of necrosis/pseudocyst and decreasing a/l and LFTs, he
   continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.  Despite
   ongoing extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
   Agree with plan to continue ACV. We will attempt to better compensate
   with [**Month/Day (2) 494**] for his ongoing/worsening AGMA with recruiting alveoli by
   increasing his TV and PEEP as his distended abd is likely contributing
   to atelectasis. We will monitor his lactate and abgs closely. We will
   begin discussions with family regarding trach placement given prolonged
   ventilation.
   ---We continue broad empiric antibx coverage for VAP.  We have
   discussed a broad potential infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI,
   line infection, fungal infection given tpn, recurrent biliary
   obstruction, acalculous chole, pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis,
   loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE) and continue extensive infection
   work-up.  We will change out lines (no growth to date from blood and
   sites without erythema) and obtain SBE to eval for vegetations (low
   clinical suspicion with neg bl cxs and no stigmata of sbe).  We will
   start empiric anti-fungal coverage given risk of [**Female First Name (un) **] from tpn, and
   will continue empiric flagyl for ? c diff  (cx neg X 2, ileus with poor
   GI absorption for PO vanco).
   --His acute on CRI is slowly worsening with increasing uremia.  We
   continue to compenasate with [**Female First Name (un) 494**] as above and he is making adequate
   urine. If acoidosis worsens and unable to optimize with [**Last Name (LF) 494**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] be HD
   candidate.
   --His abd remains distended, likely related to ileus. KUB without
   obstruction.  He remains NPO given bilous output.  We continue to
   follow bladder pressures, though urine outpt remains adequate and there
   has been no evidence of  abd compartment syndrome.  We continue to
   appreciate additional surgical and Gi recommendations.
   --He remains sedated, with MS [**First Name (Titles) 9749**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9750**] by uremia and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from ICU/infection.
   --He remains hyperglycemic despite adjustments to TPN and SSI.  We will
   start an insulin gtt.
   We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

   Addendum
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 974**] (pulm fellow) and I spoke with pt
s family and updated
   them.  All questions were addressed.  Family understands that he is
   critically ill requiring full ventilatory support with MODS (lungs,
   kidneys) with ongoing infection. I discussed ongoing infection work-up
   and plan to resite central and a-line.  I began discussion regarding
   tracheostomy, explaing about the procedure and indications.  Family
   will continue to think about this and we will rediscuss over the next
   1-2 days.  Family understands that pt is very ill and his condition is
   slowly declining but we continue ongoing aggressive care and will
   continue to update them regularly.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis, respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and gallstone pancreatitis. He has profound metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia, and is currently experiencing fevers and leukocytosis. The patient is in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with poor prognosis.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including an inability to compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, renal failure, COPD, abdominal distention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He requires full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for weaning or spontaneous breathing trials.

Despite improving gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of necrosis or pseudocyst, the patient continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis. The source of infection remains unclear despite extensive infection evaluation.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is slowly worsening, and he is making adequate urine with ongoing hemodialysis (HD) discussions. His abdomen remains distended due to ileus, and he remains NPO with bilious output. There has been no evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome, and bladder pressures are being closely monitored.

The patient remains sedated due to uremia and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from the ICU/infection. He is also hyperglycemic despite adjustments to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and stress sugar intake. An insulin gtt will be"

Imaging:
TTE ([**9-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic fu
nction are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen. Ther
e is no anterior pericardial effusion.
Technically suboptimal study. No definite evidence for valvular regurgitation or
 valvular pathology identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed and apical/parasternal views also
 available) of [**2153-9-17**], the right ventricle appears normal in cavity size on the
 current study.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggest
ed to better define the cardiac valves.
CT abd/pelvis ([**9-21**]):
1. Severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections.
2. No abscesses or fluid collections identified.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung collapse.

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement. He has
   COPD which could have contributed to this respiratory distress. Also,
   pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his CO2 to
   compensate for his metabolic acidosis. Pt also has anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, likely secondary to uremia. Increasing PEEP to 10 and Vt to
   480 didn
t improve acidosis.  Now febrile, with leukocytosis with
   bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**] also
   have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   tomorrow

   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.
   diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out
   sinusitis.  Endocarditis was not seen on TTE.  Osteo remains on the
   differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Vanc trough low at
   5.7, will need to go up on the dose.
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - f/u urine eos
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider renal consult
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - insulin drip if can give through CVL or can get a PIV
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status: pt appears euvolemic.
   - keep Is and Os even today

   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or sedation/fentanyl
   decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally

========================================
Imaging:
TTE ([**9-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic fu
nction are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen. Ther
e is no anterior pericardial effusion.
Technically suboptimal study. No definite evidence for valvular regurgitation or
 valvular pathology identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed and apical/parasternal views also
 available) of [**2153-9-17**], the right ventricle appears normal in cavity size on the
 current study.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggest
ed to better define the cardiac valves.
CT abd/pelvis ([**9-21**]):
1. Severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections.
2. No abscesses or fluid collections identified.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung collapse.

========================================
Imaging:
TTE ([**9-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic fu
nction are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen. Ther
e is no anterior pericardial effusion.
Technically suboptimal study. No definite evidence for valvular regurgitation or
 valvular pathology identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed and apical/parasternal views also
 available) of [**2153-9-17**], the right ventricle appears normal in cavity size on the
 current study.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggest
ed to better define the cardiac valves.
CT abd/pelvis ([**9-21**]):
1. Severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections.
2. No abscesses or fluid collections identified.
3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung collapse.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement. He has
   COPD which could have contributed to this respiratory distress. Pt has
   anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia, he retains
   CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his CO2 to compensate for
   his metabolic acidosis. Now febrile, with leukocytosis with bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**] also have
   atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to extubation
   include weakness and need to transition him from this metabolic
   acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   today
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.
   diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out
   sinusitis.  Endocarditis was not seen on TTE.  Osteo remains on the
   differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Vanc trough low at
   5.7, dose increased from Q48 to Q24.
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - ID consult today
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - continue Morphine Sulfate 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN pain
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   - touch base with radiology re MRI to assess for pancreatic abscesses
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal consult , consider HD in the future
   - pt appears euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure, keep Is
   and Os even today
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach erosions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or sedation/fentanyl
   decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of COPD, pancreatitis, and renal failure.
- He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to hypercarbic respiratory failure.
- The patient is febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, raising concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- He also has severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections or abscesses, and gallstones have been identified as the cause.
- The patient's abdomen is distended, and he has elevated abdominal pressures, likely contributing to atelectasis.
- He has anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia, and is unable to compensate for his respiratory distress.
- There is a concern for sepsis, with unclear sources, and potential urinary tract infection (UTI) given the presence of a Foley catheter.
- The patient's blood cultures are pending, and his urine culture is negative twice.
- He has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, indicating renal failure.
- His calcium level is improving, but he is still hyperglycemic.
- Anemia of inflammation is suspected, and there is a concern for gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient's blood pressure is elevated, possibly due to pain or sedation.
- The goals of care are discussed, considering the patient's poor prognosis.
- The patient's family has been updated on his status."

========================================
Imaging:
TTE ([**9-24**]): Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global systolic fu
nction are normal (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are not well seen. No definite mitral regurgitation is seen. Ther
e is no anterior pericardial effusion.
Technically suboptimal study. No definite evidence for valvular regurgitation or
 valvular pathology identified.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed and apical/parasternal views also
 available) of [**2153-9-17**], the right ventricle appears normal in cavity size on the
 current study.
If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate or high, a TEE is suggest
ed to better define the cardiac valves.
CT abd/pelvis ([**9-21**]):
   1. Severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections.
   2. No abscesses or fluid collections identified.
   3. Bilateral pleural effusions with associated lung collapse.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement. He has
   COPD which could have contributed to this respiratory distress. Also,
   pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his CO2 to
   compensate for his metabolic acidosis. Pt also has anion gap metabolic
   acidosis, likely secondary to uremia. Increasing PEEP to 10 and Vt to
   480 didn
t improve acidosis.  Now febrile, with leukocytosis with
   bilateral infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**] also
   have atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to
   extubation include weakness and need to transition him from this
   metabolic acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   tomorrow
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.
   diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out
   sinusitis.  Endocarditis was not seen on TTE.  Osteo remains on the
   differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Vanc trough low at
   5.7, will need to go up on the dose.
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - f/u urine eos
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider renal consult
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - insulin drip if can give through CVL or can get a PIV
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status: pt appears euvolemic.
   - keep Is and Os even today
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or sedation/fentanyl
   decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP

   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.
   diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out
   sinusitis.  Endocarditis was not seen on TTE.  Osteo remains on the
   differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Vanc trough low at
   5.7, will need to go up on the dose.
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - Fentanyl for pain control
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - f/u urine eos
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - consider renal consult
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - insulin drip if can give through CVL or can get a PIV
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach ersions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintatin active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * Fluid status: pt appears euvolemic.
   - keep Is and Os even today
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or sedation/fentanyl
   decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to COPD exacerbation. He is febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has severe pancreatitis with no fluid collections, no abscesses or fluid collections identified on CT abdomen/pelvis, and severe COPD with hypercarbic respiratory failure. He has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two ERCP procedures. He has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely secondary to VAP, and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other complications include acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, and fluid overload. The patient's condition is described as poor prognosis, and a family meeting has been held to discuss this.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of VAP. This is a common complication in patients who are intubated for an extended period of time.
2. Sepsis: The patient meets the SIRS criteria for sepsis, indicating a systemic inflammatory response. Given his history of pancreatitis, COPD, and other comorbidities, he is at"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, and abd
   distention/ileus.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis
          Acidosis (AGMA)
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of  sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  Despite that his gallstone pancreatitis is improving without
   evidence of necrosis/pseudocyst and decreasing a/l and LFTs, he
   continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.  Despite
   ongoing extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
   Agree with plan to continue ACV. We will continue current settings.  We
   are temporaizing but limnited in terms of further compensatoing with
   vent for his ongoing/worsening AGMA.  We will monitor his lactate and
   abgs closely. We will cont to discuss with family regarding trach
   placement given prolonged ventilation.
   ---His wbc is down slightly but he remains febrile.  Thgough this may
   be from his pancreatitis that appears to be improving and we are more
   concerned for evolving infections. We continue broad empiric antibx
   coverage for VAP.  We have discussed a broad potential infection ddx
   (including c. diff, UTI,  line infection, fungal infection given tpn,
   recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole, pseudocyst or
   pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE) and continue
   extensive infection work-up.Lines were changed yesterday.  Without
   evidence of SBE on TTE though limited study our clincial suspicion of
   this is low. We continue empiric antifungal coverage and c diff
   coverage.  We will change out lines (no growth to date from blood and
   sites without erythema) and obtain SBE to eval for vegetations (low
   clinical suspicion with neg bl cxs and no stigmata of sbe).  We will
   start empiric anti-fungal coverage given risk of [**Female First Name (un) **] from tpn, and
   will continue empiric flagyl for ? c diff  (cx neg X 2, ileus with poor
   GI absorption for PO vanco).  Follow vano levels.  Will consult ID for
   any further input regarding antibx and infectious sources.
   --His acute on CRI is slowly worsening with increasing uremia and gap.
   As we are limtied as to furthe compensation with vent, he will likely
   require HD.  Will consult renal for input.  Continue renal dosing of
   meds.
   --His abd remains distended, likely related to ileus. His OG outpt is
   decreasing slowly.  KUB without obstruction.  He remains NPO given
   bilous output.  We continue to follow bladder pressures, though urine
   outpt remains adequate and there has been no evidence of  abd
   compartment syndrome.  We continue to appreciate additional surgical
   and Gi recommendations.
    --He remains sedated, with MS [**First Name (Titles) 9749**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9750**] by uremia and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from ICU/infection.  We will try to
   lighten sedation and follow exam as able.  Will follow triglycerides
   and pancreatic enzymes given propofol.
   --He remains hyperglycemic now on insulin gtt.
   We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a complex medical history including respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, abdominal distention, fevers, leukocytosis, acute on chronic renal failure, and severe gallstone pancreatitis.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including the inability to compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, renal failure, COPD, distended abdomen, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient continues to require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for weaning or spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is improving without evidence of necrosis or pseudocyst formation, but he continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis. Despite ongoing extensive infection evaluation, the source of infection has not been identified.

The patient is in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with a poor prognosis. The plan is to continue antibiotic coverage for VAP, and the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of infection.

The patient's white blood cell count is down slightly, but he remains febrile. Although this may be due to his improving pancreatitis, there is concern for evolving infections, and broad empiric antibiotic coverage will be continued.

   sputum yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abd distention/ileus,
   and declining renal function/uremia.
   Primary issues include:
          Sepsis
          Acidosis (AGMA)
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  Despite that his gallstone pancreatitis seems to be
   improving without evidence of necrosis/pseudocyst and decreasing a/l
   and LFTs, he continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
   Agree with plan to continue ACV support.  We will continue current vent
   settings. Will discuss with family regarding trach placement given
   prolonged ventilation.
   --His acute on CRI is worsening. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   uremia.  Pt may benefit from dialysis for fluid removal and clearance.
   Will will consult renal team for input.  .  Continue renal dosing of
   meds.
   ---His leukocytosis is slightly decreased, but he remains febrile.
   Seems unlikely to be [**2-26**] to his pancreatitis and we remain more
   concerned for evolving infections. We have evaluated for a broad
   potential infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal
   infection given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole,
   pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE)
   which has been unrevealing. Lines were changed yesterday. We continue
   broad empiric antibx coverage for VAP. We continue empiric antifungal
   coverage (day 2) and c diff coverage (day 3).  Will consult ID for any
   further input regarding antibx and infection source.
   --His abd remains distended, likely related to ileus. His OG outpt is
   decreasing slowly.  KUB without obstruction.  He remains NPO given
   bilous output.  We continue to follow bladder pressures, though urine
   outpt remains adequate and there has been no evidence of  abd
   compartment syndrome.
    --He remains sedated, with MS [**First Name (Titles) 9749**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9750**] by uremia and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from ICU/infection.  Will minimize
   sedation and follow exam as able.  Will follow triglycerides and
   pancreatic enzymes given propofol.
   --He remains hyperglycemic now on insulin gtt.
   We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, and severe gallstone pancreatitis. He has profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, and is experiencing ongoing fevers and leukocytosis. The patient requires full ventilator support and is not a candidate for weaning. He also has abdominal distention, ileus, and worsening renal function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS): Given the patient's critical condition and multiple organ dysfunction, there is a high risk of MODS.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression: The patient's renal function is worsening, and if left untreated, it may progress to end-stage renal disease.
4. Infection: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the patient remains febrile and leukocytosis, indicating a potential ongoing infection.
5. Complications related to pancreatitis: The patient has severe gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocyst formation, and infected pancreatic necrosis.
6. Abdominal compartment syndrome: The patient's abdominal distention and ileus increase the risk of developing abdominal compartment syndrome.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement. He has
   COPD which could have contributed to this respiratory distress. Pt has
   anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia, he retains
   CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his CO2 to compensate for

   atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to extubation
   include weakness and need to transition him from this metabolic
   acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   today

   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.

 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient has anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia, and is unable to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. He is also febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which is concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and had two ERCP procedures with partial sphincterotomy and stent placement. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). Other conditions include diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, and diverticular disease. The patient's prognosis appears to be poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's febrile response, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray are concerning for VAP. This is a potential complication of mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. This could be due to ATN, pre-renal azotemia, or AIN. Prompt intervention is necessary to prevent further deterioration of renal function.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. He is intubated and sedated, with a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has COPD, metabolic acidosis, and elevated abdominal pressures. There is a history of gallstone pancreatitis, with an ERCP showing a retained stone. The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with an increased creatinine level. Other conditions include diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's prognosis appears poor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP): The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray indicate a possible infection. Immediate treatment is necessary to prevent further complications.
2. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and difficulty in breathing may lead to an exacerbation of his chronic respiratory condition.
3. Pancreatitis complications: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's renal failure and elevated creatinine level suggest a risk of worsening kidney function, potentially requiring dialysis.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's heme-positive stools and history of gastritis, PUD, diverticulosis, and colon cancer may indicate gastrointestinal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. This could be VAP, but pt has been on vanc, zosyn and cipro for
   about a week, and continues to have fevers.
   - d/c IV Flagyl (C diff neg x3)
   - d/c VAP abx tomorrow after 8d course
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin, consider d/c
   in 1-2d
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR revealed new LLL opacity, concerning for pleural effusion in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - since pt has been on ventilator for over a week, no sign of
   extubation soon, will talk with family re trach and get trach consult
   today
   - continue to be off propofol
   - renal rec: no HD for now
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. PIP significantly higher
   than plateau pressure, question if he has higher resistance due to COPD
   exacerbation.
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving. s/p ERCP x2 which showed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - peel off abx tomorrow
   - OGT in place for GI decompression, output decreasing
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will consider transition to TF since pt has less OGT output now -> get
   him on IR schedule for Fri
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus for pain as well
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following.  No HD for now. Cr
   increased again but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal consult , consider HD in the future
   - pt appears euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure, keep Is
   and Os even today
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions, including ERCP, antibiotics, and other medications. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure ranging from 148/50-188/89 mmHg, heart rate of 84 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, difficulty assessing lung bases, distended abdomen without guarding or rigidity, swollen testes, and 2+ hand edema. His mental status is poor, with eyes wide open and unresponsiveness to voice.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but decreased hematocrit, creatinine, calcium, and magnesium levels. His liver function tests are slightly abnormal, with elevated alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase. The amylase and lipase levels are significantly elevated, indicating ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Blood cultures have been negative, and there is no evidence of infection in the urine or catheter tip cultures. Imaging studies reveal new right lower lobe opacity, possibly due to atelectasis, effusion, plug, or infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis
   and renal failure.
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement. He has
   COPD which could have contributed to this respiratory distress. Pt has
   anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely secondary to uremia, he retains
   CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his CO2 to compensate for
   his metabolic acidosis. Now febrile, with leukocytosis with bilateral
   infiltrates on CXR, concerning for VAP (see below). [**Month (only) 51**] also have
   atelectasis from increased abdominal pressure. Barriers to extubation
   include weakness and need to transition him from this metabolic
   acidosis to his baseline.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt has elevated abdominal pressures
   (again) and metabolic acidosis that requires RR to compensate
   appropriately in setting of chronic resp acidosis from COPD.
   - cannot increase RR too much as pt is [**Name (NI) 9752**], and pt may stack
   breaths. Also, if inceasing RR too much, may end up just ventilating
   dead space.
   -Treatment of VAP (see below)
   - Continue sedation to make pt more comfortable
   - The treatment for uremic acidosis would be dialysis, consult renal
   today
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis.
   - Correct metabolic acidosis as above
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt meets SIRS criteria again for Temp, WBC, and RR. Unclear
   sources. Could be VAP. Cholangitis or continued obstruction is possible
   but not seen on ERCP.  Pancreatic necrosis is less likely given pt
   would appear much more ill and it was not noted on CT [**Last Name (un) **]. Pt may also
   have UTI in setting of foley, bacteremia or infected lines. Urine
   culture neg x2. Blood cx NGTD from [**Date range (1) 9733**]. Lines were changed. C.
   diff negative x2 and LENI negative for DVT. CT sinus ruled out
   sinusitis.  Endocarditis was not seen on TTE.  Osteo remains on the
   differential.
   - Empiric treatment with vanco, zosyn and cipro. Vanc trough low at
   5.7, dose increased from Q48 to Q24.
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin
   - will resend another C diff (although neg x 2) and empirically start
   tx with IV flagyl
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - ID consult today
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis - s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone
   obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt had partial sphincterotomy with retained
   stone.  Had another ERCP [**2153-9-20**] with old stent removal/new stent
   placement with grossly distended abdomen after.  Abdominal exam showed
   continued distention after initial improvement after OGT placement.
   Pancreatitis improving. Calcium level improving.
   -Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - continue zosyn, vanc and cipro as above
   - OGT in place for GI decompression
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will transition to TF when pt has less OGT output
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - continue Morphine Sulfate 2-4 mg IV Q2H:PRN pain
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   - touch base with radiology re MRI to assess for pancreatic abscesses
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Cr increased again but UOP is good
   (80-100cc/hr). DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal consult , consider HD in the future
   - pt appears euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure, keep Is
   and Os even today
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct continues to drop.  Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. The most
   likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd but no IV contrast given so
   may not be able to assess. Heme positive stools on admission
 may be
   due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include diverticular
   bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o adenomas. No
   history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach erosions seen on
   ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated when pt turned or sedation/fentanyl
   decreased. [**Month (only) 51**] be in response to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of
   renal insufficiency.
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, and renal failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is also febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, which raises concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient has a history of COPD, which could contribute to his respiratory distress. He is retaining CO2 at baseline and unable to compensate for metabolic acidosis. The patient's current treatment includes antibiotics for suspected VAP, sedation to maintain comfort, and continuation of TPN due to increased abdominal pressures.

The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by an increase in creatinine levels. He has acute on chronic renal failure, and the differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The plan is to maintain urine output above 30 cc/hr, monitor central venous pressures, and consult with a nephrologist.

The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, possibly due to pancreatitis, stress response, and TPN. Insulin therapy is being continued to manage hyperglycemia.

The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Hemolysis is not supported by elevated haptoglobin and normal peripheral smear. Possible sources"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including hypercarbic respiratory failure, pancreatitis, renal failure, COPD, sepsis, gallstone pancreatitis, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and sedated. He is febrile with leukocytosis and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has elevated abdominal pressures, metabolic acidosis, and anion gap metabolic acidosis likely due to uremia. He has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two ERCP procedures with partial improvement. The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he requires renal consultation for potential dialysis. His blood glucose levels are uncontrolled, and his anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation. His blood pressure is poorly controlled, and he requires continued monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's clinical presentation suggests VAP, indicated by fever, leukocytosis, and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Appropriate treatment should be initiated promptly.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azot"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abd distention/ileus,
   and declining renal function/uremia.
   Primary issues include:
          Acidosis (AGMA), [**2-26**] uremia
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention/ileus
              VAP

          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
              COPD
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  He continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and may possibly all be related to pancreatitis
   or less likely drug fever. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
   ---Agree with plan to continue ACV support.  We will continue current
   vent settings. Will talk with family again regarding trach placement
   given prolonged ventilation, and likely consult IP team today.
   Continue mdis.
   --His acute on CRI is worsening. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   uremia.  Renal input appreciated.  Continue renal dosing of meds and
   avoidance of nephrotoxins. F/u urine studies.  Appears to be heading
   toward HD, and family is agreeable to this.
   ---His continues to have high temps and leukocytosis.  Possibly all [**2-26**]
   to severe pancreatitis.  We have evaluated for a broad potential
   infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal infection
   given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole, pseudocyst
   or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE) which has
   been unrevealing. Lines were changed. We continue broad empiric antibx
   coverage for VAP day [**8-1**]. We will d/c flagyl, as c diff cx are neg X
   3.  Will continue empiric micofungin (day 3) given TPN and will
   reasses.  Appreciate ID input.  Will plan to reimage pancrease/abd in
   several days or if acute change in clinical exam or status.
   --His OG outpt is decreasing and ileus slowly resolving.  Will c/s for
   post-pyloric DHT placement by IR and consider initiating TFs in next
   few days. Remains on TPN for now.  We continue to follow bladder
   pressures, though urine outpt remains adequate and there has been no
   evidence of abd compartment syndrome.
    --He remains unresponsive, now off sedation. His MS is further
   impacted by uremia and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from
   ICU/infection.Continue to monitor. Pain control as needed. Follow
   triglycerides and pancreatic enzymes w/ propofol.
    --He remains on insulin gtt for BS control.
   --We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, and renal failure (acute on chronic renal insufficiency). The patient is currently in the ICU and is experiencing several medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, indicating an ongoing infection. Despite extensive infection evaluation, the source of infection has not been identified.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in the setting of sepsis, renal failure, COPD, abdominal distention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He requires full ventilator support and is not a candidate for weaning or spontaneous breathing trials.

3. Abdominal Distention/Ileus: The patient has a distended abdomen and ileus. This can be a result of his severe gallstone pancreatitis or due to other factors such as medications or critical illness.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Insufficiency (ACRI): The patient's renal function is worsening, and he is heading toward hemodialysis (HD).

5. Metabolic Acidosis with Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis (AGMA): The patient has profound metabolic acidosis, which is further complicated by uremia.

6. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abd distention/ileus,
   and declining renal function/uremia.
   Primary issues include:
          Acidosis (AGMA)
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  He continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and this is possibly all related to his
   pancreatitis. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
   Agree with plan to continue ACV support.  We will continue current vent
   settings. Will talk with family again regarding trach placement given
   prolonged ventilation, and liekly consult IP team today.  Continue
   mdis.
   --His acute on CRI is worsening. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   uremia.  Renal input appreciated.  Continue renal dosing of meds.
   Likely headed toward HD.
   ---His continues to have high temps and leukocytosis.  Possibly all
   attribtued to his pancreatitis.  We have evaluated for a broad
   potential infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal
   infection given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole,
   pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE)
   which has been unrevealing. Lines were changed yesterday. We continue
   broad empiric antibx coverage for VAP day [**8-1**]  We will d/c falgyl today
   as c diff cx are neg X 3.  Will continue empiric micofungin (day 3)
   given TPN and will reasses.  Appreciate ID input.  Will plan to reimage
   pancrease/abd in several days.
   --His OG outpt is decreasing and ileus resolving.  Will plan for
   post-pyloric DHT placement and consider initaiing TFs in next few
   days,  Remains on TPN for now.  We continue to follow bladder
   pressures, though urine outpt remains adequate and there has been no
   evidence of  abd compartment syndrome.
    --He remains sedated,we have stopped propfol to assess MS [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
   further impacted by uremia and toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from
   ICU/infection. Pain control as needed. Will follow triglycerides and
   pancreatic enzymes given propofol.
    --He remains on insulin gtt.
   We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with sepsis, acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency (ACRI), acute respiratory failure, severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient's condition is worsening, and potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed high fevers and leukocytosis, indicating a possible infection. VAP is a common complication in patients receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is declining, and he has acute on chronic renal insufficiency. AKI can lead to further deterioration of renal function and may require dialysis.

3. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis due to an infection, which can progress to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).

4. Complications of pancreatitis: The patient has severe gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, abscess formation, and biliary complications.

5. Metabolic disturbances: The patient has metabolic acidosis and hypocalcemia, which can lead to various complications such as cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, and altered mental status.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may require prolonged mechanical ventilation and"

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read): compared to yesterday, L sided pleural
   effusion has significantly decreased. R lung field opacity has
   decreased as well but continues to have blunted right diaphragm.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. This could be VAP, but pt has been on vanc, zosyn and cipro for
   about a week, and continues to have fevers.
   - d/c IV Flagyl (C diff neg x3)
   - d/c VAP abx tomorrow after 8d course
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin, consider d/c
   in 1-2d
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR revealed new LLL opacity, concerning for pleural effusion in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - since pt has been on ventilator for over a week, no sign of
   extubation soon, will talk with family re trach and get trach consult
   today
   - continue to be off propofol
   - renal rec: no HD for now
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. PIP significantly higher
   than plateau pressure, question if he has higher resistance due to COPD
   exacerbation.
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving. s/p ERCP x2 which showed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - peel off abx tomorrow
   - OGT in place for GI decompression, output decreasing
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will consider transition to TF since pt has less OGT output now -> get
   him on IR schedule for Fri
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus for pain as well
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following.  No HD for now. Cr
   increased again but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN.
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal consult , consider HD in the future
   - pt appears euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure, keep Is
   and Os even today
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two ERCP procedures. The patient has been on various antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBI), but no source of infection has been identified. His urine output is good, and he is euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure. The patient's condition remains poor, and he has multiple medical complications that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Despite being on appropriate antibiotics for VAP, the patient continues to have fevers, which may indicate persistent infection or antibiotic resistance.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBI): The patient's central lines should be monitored for signs of infection, and cultures should be obtained to rule out CRBI.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are increasing. He requires careful fluid management and monitoring of renal function.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which is slowly improving. His pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) should be trended, and he should be monitored for any complications related to pancre"

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read): compared to yesterday, L sided pleural
   effusion has significantly decreased. R lung field opacity has
   decreased as well but continues to have blunted right diaphragm.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. This could be VAP, but pt has been on vanc, zosyn and cipro for
   about a week, and continues to have fevers.
   - d/c IV Flagyl (C diff neg x3)
   - d/c VAP abx today after 8d course
   - d/c vanco with continued monitoring
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin, consider d/c
   in 1-2d
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of [**Known lastname 9812**] and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR revealed new LLL opacity, concerning for pleural effusion in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - since pt has been on ventilator for over a week, no sign of
   extubation soon, will talk with family re trach and f/u trach consult
   - continue to be off propofol
   - renal rec: no HD for now
   - f/u with anesthesia for trach tomorrow
   .
   # COPD
 pt retains CO2 at baseline and is unable to breathe off his
   CO2 to compensate for his metabolic acidosis. PIP significantly higher
   than plateau pressure, question if he has higher resistance due to COPD
   exacerbation.
   - MDIs while on the vent
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving. s/p ERCP x2 which showed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.
   - Trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - peel off abx today
   - OGT in place for GI decompression, output decreasing
   - continue TPN (instead of TF) given increased abdominal distention,
   will consider transition to TF since pt has less OGT output now -> get
   him on IR schedule for Fri
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus for pain as well
   - appreciate surgery recs / GI recs
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following: thinking about HD
   in [**2-27**] days. Cr increased again but UOP is good. DDx include ATN,
   pre-renal and AIN.
   - HD line today
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - f/u repeat UA, manually inspect urine sediment for casts
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - f/u renal consult , consider HD in the future
   - pt appears euvolemic despite acute on chronic renal failure, keep Is
   and Os even today
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   BP increases when eliciting pain.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   - Address pain and monitor BP
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the information provided in the physician's daily progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for over a week, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The physician has ordered a bundle of interventions to prevent VAP, including peeling off antibiotics.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This may progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Nosocomial infections: Due to the prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures, the patient is at risk for developing nosocomial infections such as bloodstream infections or catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs).
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and hypercoagulability state increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as heparin are being taken to reduce this risk.
5. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and poor responsiveness may indicate delirium, which can complicate the clinical picture and prolong recovery time.
6. Complications related to pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may"

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read): compared to yesterday, L sided pleural
   effusion has significantly decreased. R lung field opacity has
   decreased as well but continues to have blunted right diaphragm.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. This could be VAP, but pt has been on vanc, zosyn and cipro for
   about a week, and continues to have fevers.
   - d/c IV Flagyl (C diff neg x3)
   - d/c VAP abx today after 8d course
   - d/c vanco with continued monitoring
   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin, consider d/c
   in 1-2d
   - F/u BCx
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 60, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR revealed new LLL opacity, concerning for pleural effusion in the
   setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - continue to be off propofol
   - renal recs: consider HD in [**2-27**] days
   - f/u with anesthesia for trach tomorrow
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving. s/p ERCP x2 which showed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.
   - OGT output significantly slowed down, get post-pyloric feeding tube
   today by IR, no feeding yet as pt continues to have some OGT output
   - continue to have OGT in place for GI decompression, output decreasing
   - continue TPN for now
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - peel off abx today
   - check bladder pressures [**Hospital1 7**]
   - check ionized calcium [**Hospital1 7**]
 replete as necessary
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following: thinking about HD
   in [**2-27**] days. Cr increased again but UOP is good. DDx include ATN,
   pre-renal and AIN.
   - HD line today or tomorrow
   - IV lasix 80mg once today
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been treated for various infections, including pneumonia and catheter-related bloodstream infection, but no definitive source of infection has been identified. He has also been diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and gallstone pancreatitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation put him at risk for developing VAP. The healthcare team is monitoring for signs of infection and implementing appropriate preventive measures.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may worsen due to ongoing kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function and consideration of dialysis may be necessary.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation. Continued monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and imaging studies may be required.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory condition may deteriorate further, potentially necessitating tracheostomy placement and long-term ventilation support.
5. Infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have fevers. Additional diagnostic tests and cultures may be needed to identify the underlying infection and guide appropriate treatment.

   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abd distention/ileus,
   and declining renal function/[**Telephone/Fax (3) 9812**].
   Primary issues include:
          Acidosis (AGMA), [**2-26**] [**Month/Day (2) 9812**]
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention/ileus
              VAP
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
              COPD
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  He continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and may possibly all be related to severe
   pancreatitis or less likely drug fever. Pt remains in MODS with poor
   prognosis.
    Agree with plan to continue current vent settings. IP c/s
d for trach,
   planned for  [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] need his ET upsized to # 8 prior
   (anesthesiology consulted) . PIPS up in setting of abd distention and
   volume overload. Continue mdis and follow plt pr.
   --His acute on CRI continues to worsen. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   [**Month/Day (2) 9812**].  Renal input appreciated.  Will trial diuresis today.  Will
   likely initiate HD in next few days. Will needs IR placed temp HD
   catheter. Continue renal dosing of meds and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
   ---He continues to have high temps and profound leukocytosis.  Possibly
   all [**2-26**] to severe pancreatitis.  We have evaluated for a broad
   potential infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal
   infection given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole,
   pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE)
   which has been unrevealing. Flagyl stopped yesterday given neg c diff X
   3.  He has now received broad empiric antibx for possible VAPX 8 days.
   Vanco dose adjusted 2 days ago, and levels not persistently therapeutic
   prior.  However, no mrsa or pos cx data to date.  We will d/c antibx
   and reassess as also concern for drug fever.  Repeat differential for
   eos. Will continue empiric micofungin (day 4) given TPN and will
   reasses.  Appreciate ID input.  Will plan to reimage pancrease/abd in
   several days or if acute change in clinical exam or status.
    --His ileus is slowly resolving, though he continues to have high OG
   outpt.  Post-pyloric DHT placed today by IR.  Consider initiating TFs
   in next few days once OG outpt further decreased. Remains on TPN for
   now, with very poor nutritional status.  We continue to follow bladder

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, acute kidney injury, ileus, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 91 beats per minute, blood pressure of 139/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30.0 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), with an INR of 1.4. 

Imaging studies reveal atelectasis and effusions on chest X-ray, and the patient's urine analysis shows trace leukocytes and 24 red blood cells. 

The patient's current medications include broad-spectrum antibiotics, insulin, antacids, diuretics, and pain management with dilaudid. 

The patient's condition is described as critical, with ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal distention, ileus, and declining renal function. The patient remains intub"

   and declining renal function/[**Telephone/Fax (3) 9812**].

   This pt

   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  He continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and may possibly all be related to pancreatitis
   or less likely drug fever. Pt remains in MODS with poor prognosis.
    --Agree with plan to continue ACV support.  We will continue current
   vent settings. Ip c/s

   --His acute on CRI is worsening. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   [**Month/Day (2) 9812**].  Renal input appreciated.  Will trial diuresis today.  Will
   liekly intiiate HD in next vf days.  Needs IR placed temp HD line.
   Continue renal dosing of meds and avoidance of nephrotoxins.
   ---His continues to have high temps and leukocytosis.  Possibly all [**2-26**]

   infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal infection
   given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole, pseudocyst
   or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE) which has

   continue empiric micofungin (day 3) given TPN and will reasses.
   Appreciate ID input.  Will plan to reimage pancrease/abd in several
   days or if acute change in clinical exam or status.
    --His OG outpt is decreasing and ileus slowly resolving.  Post-pyloric
   DHT placed today by IR.  Consider initiating TFs in next few days once
   OG outpt less. Remains on TPN for now with very poor nutirional
   status.  We continue to follow bladder pressures, though urine outpt
   remains adequate and there has been no evidence of abd compartment

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint includes gallstone pancreatitis, sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and requires full ventilator support.

The patient's current assessment includes profound metabolic acidosis, hypocalcemia, abdominal distention/ileus, and a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient also has ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, and declining renal function.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and the need for full ventilator support indicate a high risk for developing ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, leading to impaired oxygenation.

2. Multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS): The patient's critical illness and poor prognosis suggest a risk of MODS, which occurs when multiple organs fail due to systemic inflammation or infection.

3. Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy: The patient's sepsis and hypotension may lead to sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened and dysfunction due to systemic infection.

4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's declining renal function and acute on chronic renal failure indicate a risk of developing AKI. This"

   - continue empiric antifungal treatment with micafungin, consider d/c
   in a few days
   - continued monitoring and culture if spikes
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs

   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR improved after lasix yesterday.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - tracheostomy today

   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He has been in the ICU for an extended period and is currently intubated, with no improvement in his condition. The patient has multiple comorbidities including gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, and potential gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been experiencing fevers despite being on antibiotics. The source of infection is still unknown, and the patient continues to have positive blood cultures pending. This suggests a high risk of ongoing or recurrent infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation, indicating ongoing respiratory failure. His underlying COPD may contribute to this complication, and the presence of bilateral opacities on chest X-ray suggests possible effusions or fluid overload.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as indicated by rising creatinine levels. There is a need for further evaluation and potential hemodialysis to manage his renal function.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, which is slowly improving but still requires close monitoring. Ongoing pain management and consideration of further interventions like repeat CT abdomen may be necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient has stable hematocrit levels, but further investigation is needed to determine the cause of an"

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

- Vital signs: The patient has a temperature of 102.8°F (39.3°C), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/48 mmHg to 193/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation.
- Physical examination: The patient is intubated, not sedated, and not following commands. There is distant heart sound with a regular rhythm and normal rate. The patient has a distended abdomen with guarding and hypoactive bowel sounds. There is also swollen scrotum and 2+ hand edema.
- Lab results: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), low albumin, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and abnormal electrolyte levels.
- Imaging: The patient's chest X-ray shows volume overload significantly improved compared to yesterday, with bibasilar opacities consistent with effusion but visible costophrenic angles bilaterally.
- Assessment and plan:
   - FUO: Most likely related to severe pancreatitis. No source of infection after full workup including cultures, transesophageal echocardiogram (T"

   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and may possibly all be related to severe
   pancreatitis or less likely drug fever. Pt remains in MODS with poor
   prognosis.
    Agree with plan to continue current vent settings. IP c/s

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of gallstone pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, acute respiratory failure, severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's condition is complicated by various factors. He has ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abdominal distention/ileus, and declining renal function. The respiratory failure is multifactorial, including an inability to compensate for metabolic acidosis, renal failure, COPD, abdominal distention, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient requires full ventilator support and is not a candidate for weaning or spontaneous breathing trials.

The patient also has high fevers and profound leukocytosis, which have not been fully explained despite extensive infection evaluation. This may be related to severe pancreatitis or less likely drug fever. The patient remains in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with a poor prognosis.

In terms of management, the patient's current ventilator settings will be continued, and an tracheostomy is planned for today. The patient's ileus is slowly resolving, and post-pyloric feeding has been initiated. Trophic enteral feedings will be continued, and the possibility of additional recommendations from surgery will be considered. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be continued due"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M with sepsis, acute on CRF and acute respiratory failure in
   setting of severe gallstone pancreatitis with profound metabolic
   acidosis and hypocalcemia, course further c/b VAP on empiric broad
   antibx coverage, ongoing fevers and leukocytosis, abd distention/ileus,
   and declining renal function/[**Month/Day (2) 9812**].
   Primary issues include:
          Acidosis (AGMA), [**2-26**] [**Month/Day (2) 9812**]
          Resp failure, acute
          Abd distention/ileus
          Fevers
          Leukocytosis
          Acute on CRF
          Gallstone pancreatitis
              COPD
   This pt
s respiratory failure is multifactorial--[**2-26**] inability to
   compensate adequately for metabolic acidosis in setting of sepsis, and
   renal failure as well as COPD, distended abd, and VAP.  He continues to
   require full ventilator support and is not currently a candidate for
   wean/SBT.  He continues to have high fevers and profound leukocytosis.
   Despite extensive infection evaluation, we have been unable to identify
   a clear etiology/source and may possibly all be related to severe
   pancreatitis or less likely drug fever. Pt remains in MODS with poor
   prognosis.
    Agree with plan to continue current vent settings. IP c/s
d for trach,
   planned for today. PIPSand plts imrpoved after diuresis.  Continue mdis
   and follow plt pr.
   --His acute on CRI continues to worsen. We are limited in ability to
   compensate further with vent for his worsening AGMA which appears [**2-26**]
   [**Month/Day (2) 9812**] though his ph is holding with our current MV settings.  Renal
   input appreciated.  Did respond to lasix dose but ultimately heading to
   HD given profound [**Month/Day (2) 9812**].  Scheduled for IR palced HD line today with
   plan to intiaite HD this wkd. Will continue gently diruesis with lasix
   (neg 500 cc). Continue renal dosing of meds and avoidance of
   nephrotoxins.
   ---He continues to have high temps and profound leukocytosis.  Possibly
   all [**2-26**] to severe pancreatitis.  We have evaluated for a broad
   potential infection ddx (including c. diff, UTI, line infection, fungal
   infection given tpn, recurrent biliary obstruction, acalculous chole,
   pseudocyst or pancreatic necrosis, loculated effusion, sinusitis, SBE)
   which has been unrevealing. Given neg fungal cxs and no yeast in urine,
   will d/c empiric micofungin today.  Appreciate ID input.  Will start
   empiric [**Last Name (un) 614**] for severe pancreatitis as most likely etiology of fevers.
   Will plan to reimage pancrease/abd in several days or if acute change
   in clinical exam or status.
    --His ileus is slowly resolving,and OG outpt down.  Post-pyloric DHT
   in place. Will intiiate TFs and d/w surgery for any additional recs.
   Remains on TPN for now, with very poor nutritional status until TFs at
   goal.  We continue to follow bladder pressures, though urine outpt
   remains adequate and there has been no evidence of abd compartment
   syndrome.
     --Slightly more responsive (opens eyes) , off sedation with multiple
   potential etiologies for his altered MD [**First Name (Titles) 9401**] [**Last Name (Titles) 9812**] and
   toxic/metabolic encephalopathy from ICU/infection.  Continue to
   monitor. Pain control as needed with dilaudid.
    --He remains on insulin gtt for BS control.
    --Htn
prn labetolol, treat pain, should imrpove further w/ HD.
   -- We continue to update family and address progress/goals of care.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a complex medical history including sepsis, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory failure, severe gallstone pancreatitis, profound metabolic acidosis, and hypocalcemia. The patient has been diagnosed with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and continues to have high fevers and leukocytosis. 

The patient's primary issues include metabolic acidosis (AGMA), respiratory failure, abdominal distention/ileus, ongoing fevers, leukocytosis, acute on chronic renal failure (CRF), gallstone pancreatitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including an inability to compensate for metabolic acidosis, renal failure, distended abdomen, and VAP.

The patient's condition is described as in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) with a poor prognosis. The plan includes continuing current ventilator settings, performing a tracheostomy, placing a peripherally inserted pulmonary artery catheter (PIPS), improving platelet count, and initiating hemodialysis (HD). 

The patient's ileus is slowly resolving, and an post-pyloric feeding tube has been placed. Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is being continued due to poor nutritional status. The patient remains on insulin gtt for blood sugar control and is being treated for hypertension with labetalol. Pain management is also being addressed.

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read):
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have fevers.
   - continue meropenem, will touch base with ID re whether to continue
   - d/c micafungin
   - d/c vanc
   - continued monitoring and culture if spikes
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - Maintain UOP>30 cc/hr, MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - f/u ID recs
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic acidosis in the
   setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off propofol currently.
   CXR improved after lasix yesterday.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - tracheostomy today
   - I/O goal today is -500cc today
   - continue to be off propofol
   - renal recs: consider HD in [**2-27**] days
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving. s/p ERCP x2 which showed
   gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube
   in place since [**9-27**].
   - OGT output significantly slowed down,  can start TF today
   - continue TPN for now until goal TF is reached
   - repeat CT abd tomorrow, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following: thinking about HD
   in the next few days. Cr increased again but UOP is good. DDx include
   ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urien eos neg x2.
   - HD line today
   - I/O goal today is -500cc
   - maintain UOP >30cc/hr
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Maintain active T+S
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read): no significant change compared to yesterday,
   s/p tracheostomy.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently trached.   Pt has continued ventilator
   requirement. Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic
   acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off
   propofol currently. CXR improved after lasix yesterday.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - I/O goal today is -2L  today on HD
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - OGT output significantly slowed down,  can start TF today
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd monday, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have daily high fevers.
   - continue meropenem as per ID
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session today
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He also has a tracheostomy in place. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures, urine culture, and NG tube culture are negative. Imaging shows no significant changes in the chest X-ray.

The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, fever of unknown origin, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and hypertension. 

The treatment plan includes continuing mechanical ventilation, initiating hemodialysis, treating underlying COPD with MDIs, starting tube feeds, continuing total parenteral nutrition (TPN), monitoring liver function tests, amylase, and lipase. The patient will be monitored for potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. 

The patient's prognosis is poor, and the family has been updated on the patient's status."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently trached.   Pt has continued ventilator
   requirement. Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic
   acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off
   propofol currently. CXR improved after lasix yesterday.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - I/O goal today is -2L  today on HD
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - OGT output significantly slowed down,  can start TF today
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd monday, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have daily high fevers.
   - continue meropenem as per ID
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session today
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). His recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated blood glucose levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Imaging shows no significant changes in the chest X-ray. The patient has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two unsuccessful ERCP procedures. He also has acute on chronic renal failure, anemia of inflammation, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and poor prognosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and cultures will be necessary.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function. It is important to manage his fluid balance and adjust medications accordingly to avoid further renal deterioration.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may continue to progress and lead to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes and imaging studies may be required.
4. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count and persistent fever suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently trached.   Pt has continued ventilator
   requirement. Barriers to extubation include weakness and metabolic
   acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor mental status. Pt is off
   propofol currently. CXR improved after lasix yesterday.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - I/O goal today is -2L  today on HD
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - OGT output significantly slowed down,  can start TF today
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd monday, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have daily high fevers.
   - continue meropenem as per ID, and possible reimaging CT as above
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session today
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a diagnosis of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube. The patient's condition remains stable but has not shown significant improvement. 

The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two ERCP procedures. He also has underlying COPD and is being treated with MDIs. His renal function is compromised, and he is undergoing hemodialysis (HD) to manage his electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. 

The patient's fever persists despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, suggesting an inflammatory response. 

The patient is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and is being gradually introduced to tube feeds. His blood glucose levels are being monitored and managed with insulin infusions. 

Other medical conditions present include acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. 
2. Infection: The patient's persistent fever and elevated inflammatory markers suggest the possibility of an ongoing infection, which could be related to his pancreatitis or another source.

 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach

   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently admitted to the ICU for management of his conditions.

The patient's recent events include a blood culture taken on September 29th at 01:17 PM, fever of 102.3 degrees Fahrenheit on September 29th, and a spike in fever to 104 degrees Fahrenheit early in the morning. The infectious disease (ID) team recommends continuing with Meropenem for at least 72 hours before making any further changes to the antibiotic regimen.

The patient has undergone several interventions, including a percutaneous tracheostomy, which was done on September 28th. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to remain intubated due to weakness and metabolic acidosis related to uremia and poor mental status.

The patient has gallstone pancreatitis and is slowly improving from a laboratory standpoint. He has had two ERCP procedures, which confirmed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis. The patient has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place since September 27th, but there were concerns about possible aspiration of tube feeds. Therefore, tube feeds were stopped at 1 AM.

The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, as he has acute on chronic renal failure. His serum creatinine levels have increased again, but his urine output is good. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (AT"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure on HD, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently intubated and requires ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. The patient has undergone an ERCP procedure for gallstone obstructive pancreatitis and has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place. There are concerns about possible aspiration of tube feeds. The patient's condition is slowly improving, but he continues to have daily high fevers. His renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. He is also experiencing anemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a significant concern. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires further assessment of his respiratory status. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia, and poor mental status.
2. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): Despite full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, and line change, no source of infection has been identified. The patient continues to have daily high fevers, indicating ongoing inflammation or infection.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by an increasing creatinine level. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, or acute interstitial neph"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. On admission, the patient presented with fever, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, and pain control issues. The patient is currently receiving various medications and treatments including antibiotics, insulin, and dialysis. The patient's vital signs show fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. The patient's blood cultures were taken from the hemodialysis line. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential infection. The blood cultures taken from the hemodialysis line may indicate a catheter-related bloodstream infection.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's acute respiratory failure could potentially progress to ARDS, which is characterized by severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs.

3. Kidney Injury: The patient's acute renal failure and elevated creatinine levels indicate a risk of kidney injury. This could be due to factors such as sepsis or complications from hemodialysis.

4. Pancreatitis Complications: The patient's acute pancreatitis could lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows no interval
   change.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - first HD session yesterday (began [**9-29**])
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  Concern existed about possible
   aspiration of tube feeds.
   - try to re-initiate TF today, monitor OG tube output
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd monday, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have daily high fevers.
   - consult ID concerning abx regimen in the setting of increasing WBC
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session yesterday
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two ERCP procedures. He has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to concerns about aspiration.

The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires ongoing ventilatory support, and there are concerns about his ability to wean off the ventilator due to weakness and metabolic acidosis.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels have been rising despite hemodialysis sessions. The underlying cause of renal failure is unclear and may be related to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
3. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): Despite extensive workup including cultures, transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), CT scan of the sinuses, and line changes, no source of infection has been identified. The patient continues to have daily high fevers.
4. Anemia: The patient has a stable hemoglobin level, but further evaluation is needed to determine the cause. Possible causes include anemia of inflammation, hemolysis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows no interval
   change.
   - continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current setting
   - first HD session yesterday (began [**9-29**])
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  Concern existed about possible
   aspiration of tube feeds.
   - try to re-initiate TF today, monitor OG tube output
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd monday, the last one was from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Pt
   continues to have daily high fevers.
   - continue meropenem as per ID for at least 72 hours (day 1 is [**9-28**])
   before further changes are made, and possible reimaging CT as above.
   - continue vanc as per HD protocol
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session yesterday
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone several interventions and treatments.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 104.1 F, heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure of 119/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 29 mmHg, PaO2 of 228 mmHg, and HCO3- of 91 mEq/L.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, a regular rhythm, no murmurs, distended abdomen with guarding, hypoactive bowel sounds, and swollen scrotum. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 33.9 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 7.5 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 25.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 532 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 46 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 4.1 mg/dL, glucose of 126 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 111 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 4.1 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) of 19 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) of 7.4 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.3 mg/dL, phosphorus (PO4) of 5.4 mg/dL, and total bilirubin (T Bili) of 0.9 mg/dL.

Imaging studies show no interval change on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone two endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures. A post-pyloric feeding tube has been placed, and there are concerns about possible aspiration of tube feeds.

The patient is being treated for fever of unknown origin (FUO) with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, and the first hemodialysis (HD) session was conducted yesterday. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is currently being managed with insulin g"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure on HD, and FUO.
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows no interval
   change.
   - attempt on PS and assess ventilation
   - if not, continue on AC vent settings as pt is stable on the current
   setting
   - first HD session began [**9-29**]
   - continue to be off propofol
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 slowly improving from the laboratory
   standpoint, but clinically pt hasn
t made much progress. s/p ERCP x2
   which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  Concern existed about possible
   aspiration of tube feeds.
   - try to re-initiate TF today, monitor OG tube output
   - continue TPN
   - consider repeat CT abd in coordination with Nephro, the last one was
   from [**9-24**]
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - consult ID concerning abx regimen in the setting of increasing WBC
   - F/u BCx and urine culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - f/u ID recs
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr increased again
   but UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**]
   - I/O goal today is -2L
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * DM
 -Hold home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other
   causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in
   the setting of sepsis and acute illness.
   - continue insulin gtt
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct stable. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.  Could also be attributed to
   dialysis.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - Repeat endoscopy in 8 weeks
   .
   * HTN
Noted to be more elevated after propofol was off, could be
   secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume overload in the setting of
   acute on chronic renal failure. Holding atenolol in setting of renal
   insufficiency. Better control with HD.
   - HD today
   - dilaudid for pain control
   - continue metoprolol 5mg IV q6H as it is hepatically and renally
   cleared.
   .
   * Goals of care: Patient is not improving, appear to have poor
   prognosis
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure on hemodialysis, and fever of unknown origin (FUO). He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show a high fever, tachycardia, and low blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and impaired renal function. Imaging studies reveal no significant changes in the lungs. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) but continues to have daily high fevers. He also has anemia, hyperglycemia, and hypertension. The goals of care are to update the family on the patient's status and provide comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's high fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible ongoing infection. Despite receiving antibiotics, he has not shown improvement. There is a concern for hospital-acquired infections, including VAP or bloodstream infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's continued need for mechanical ventilation indicates severe respiratory failure. There may be a risk of ventilator-associated complications such as barotrauma, ventilator-associated pneumonia, or tension pneumothorax.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's impaired renal function requires ongoing hemodialysis. Complications associated with renal failure include fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and uremic symptoms.

   IMAGING: CXR (from today):  volume overload significantly improved
   compared to yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows improvement on
   volume overload. Respiratory rate is 38-39 this AM, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - attempt on PS and assess ventilation
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF
   - continue TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF.
   - free water deficit was calculated to be 3.8L. Would mix free water in
   with TF and continuously infuse it with TF.
    - PM lytes
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. TSH pending but previously has been normal.
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - discontinue IV metoprolol as pt does not seem to respond to it well
   - discontinue dilt gtt as blood pressure went down on the gtt
   - start dilt 30mg QID
   - f/u TSH  --2.2 (normal)
   .
   * DM
 Blood sugar has been running at low 100s, and pt was not Hold
   home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for
   hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting
   of sepsis and acute illness.
   - discontinue insulin gtt
   - start insulin ss
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct slowly trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.  Could also be attributed
   to dialysis.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - If pt resumes HD, would give 1u pRBC, however would hold off if no HD
   today
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   IMAGING: CXR (from today):  volume overload significantly improved
   compared to yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows improvement on
   volume overload. Respiratory rate is 38-39 this AM, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - attempt on PS and assess ventilation
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF
   - continue TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF.
   - free water deficit was calculated to be 3.8L. Would mix free water in
   with TF and continuously infuse it with TF.
    - PM lytes
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. TSH pending but previously has been normal.
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - discontinue IV metoprolol as pt does not seem to respond to it well
   - discontinue dilt gtt as blood pressure went down on the gtt
   - start dilt 30mg QID
   - f/u TSH  --2.2 (normal)
   .
   * DM
 Blood sugar has been running at low 100s, and pt was not Hold
   home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for
   hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting
   of sepsis and acute illness.
   - discontinue insulin gtt
   - start insulin ss
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct slowly trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.  Could also be attributed
   to dialysis.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - If pt resumes HD, would give 1u pRBC, however would hold off if no HD
   today
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   IMAGING: CXR (from today):  volume overload significantly improved
   compared to yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. CXR shows improvement on
   volume overload. Respiratory rate is 38-39 this AM, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - continue current ventilator setting as pt appears comfortable.
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF, consult surgery regarding advancing TF
   - continue TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF.
   - free water deficit was calculated to be 3.8L. Would give free water
   boluses.
    - PM lytes
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. TSH pending but previously has been normal.
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - discontinue IV metoprolol as pt does not seem to respond to it well
   - discontinue dilt gtt as blood pressure went down on the gtt
   - start dilt 30mg QID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   - f/u TSH  --2.2 (normal)
   .
   * DM
 Blood sugar has been running at low 100s, and pt was not Hold
   home oral agents. Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for
   hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting
   of sepsis and acute illness.
   - discontinue insulin gtt
   - start insulin ss
   .
   * Anemia
 Hct slowly trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.  Could also be attributed
   to dialysis.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - 1u pRBC today
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). He has been experiencing daily fevers, metabolic acidosis, and poor mental status. The patient's respiratory rate is high due to an increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis and fever. His CXR shows improvement in volume overload. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis has been treated with ERCP, and he has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place. His fever of unknown origin (FUO) is most likely related to severe pancreatitis, and all antibiotics have been discontinued. The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is being managed with HD, and his hypernatremia is likely secondary to TPN or TF. He experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR) and was treated with IV medications. The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is managed with insulin. Anemia of inflammation is suspected, and the patient may require a blood transfusion. His hypertension (HTN) is better controlled now, but initially, it was elevated after stopping propofol, which could be secondary to pain. The patient's goals of care include updating the family on his status. The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, dialysis catheter, tracheostomy, HD line, post-pyloric feeding tube, and OGT. Pro"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) WITH RVR:  As per events, new afib
   overnight requiring beta blockers/CCB. Now back in sinus rhythm on po
   diltiazem.  Cycled enzymes which are unremarkable except for slight
   increase in troponin in setting of renal insufficiency. TSH within
   normal limits.  No desaturation.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA):  Now off
   antibiotics.  Will repeat cultures in setting of persistent fevers.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   baseline BUN/creatinine 26-27/1.4-1.5.  Stable at this point.  Holding
   off on hemodialysis after discussion this morning with the renal
   consult service.  Dosing meds accordingly.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   CT scan showed inflammation c/w pancreatitis, elevated LFTs with lipase
   up 4K, WBC 19K started on flagyl and levofloxacin.  On tube feeds at 10
   cc/hour and TPN.   Will discuss with surgery possibility of increasing
   tube feeds. Following electrolytes daily.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Limited ability to wean
   at this point given persistent pleural effusions, abdominal distention,
   and metabolic acidosis.  Making good urine.  COPD on MDIs.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
   received total of 10 mgs of IV morphine at the ED, has been in pain for
   3 days priot to admission unrelieved by tylenol and ibuprofen
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION
   on atrovent inhaler at home, sats > 95% at 2 lpm/NC.  MDIs.
 H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
   Have discontinued IV insulin drip, start on subcuataneous insulin.
   Follow finger sticks.
 H/O HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
   on atenolol and terazosin at home, vital signs stable.  Now on
   diltiazem in setting of afib overnight.   Consider titrating up beta
   blocker dose.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  In setting of persistent fever may have insensible
   losses and free water deficit.  Calculate free water deficit and
   replace.
 ANEMIA:  In setting of afib/RVR with slight bump in troponin, may
   benefit from blood transfusion.  Team discussed with family and patient
   and they have consented.

   CXR from today (my read): volume overload worse than yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor, get ABG on the new setting
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF, goal rate 40cc/hr
   - continue TPN until TF running at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Resolved s/p 1L free water (250cc boluses Q6H)
   yesterday.  Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss from
   fevers.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN
   .
   * Anemia
 s/p 1u pRBC yesterday with little Hct response from 23.7 to
   23.8 s/p transfusion. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - check Hct again this PM
   - consider another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - consider EPO
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary this am.
   - started on seroquel
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   IMAGING:
   CXR from today (my read): volume overload worse than yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - continue current ventilator setting as pt appears comfortable.
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at 40cc/hr
   - continue TPN until TF running at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers. s/p 1L free water (250cc boluses Q6H) yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN
   .
   * Anemia
 s/p 1u pRBC yesterday with little Hct response from 23 to
   23.7 s/p transfusion. The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   - consider EPO
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure on HD, and a history of COPD, gallstone pancreatitis, fever of unknown origin (FUO), acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia, and hypertension.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions. The plan includes continuing current ventilator settings, holding off HD session, treating underlying COPD with MDIs, being off propofol, maintaining good pain control with dilaudid, checking bladder pressures daily, and repleting ionized calcium as necessary.

Additionally, the patient's fever is being managed with cooling blankets, ice packs, and fans. The renal failure is being treated with IV lasix 40mg TID, and the hypernatremia is being managed by continuing to monitor and providing free water. The AFib/RVR is being treated with diltiazem 30mg QID.

The patient's DM is being managed by discontinuing insulin gtt and starting sc insulin (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS). The anemia is being investigated, and the patient is scheduled for a blood transfusion. The hypertension is being managed with diltiazem 30mg QID and consideration of switching to met"

   CXR from today (my read): volume overload worse than yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - continue current ventilator setting as pt appears comfortable.
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at 40cc/hr
   - continue TPN until TF running at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers. s/p 1L free water (250cc boluses Q6H) yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 s/p 1u pRBC yesterday. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and multiple medical complications. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 168/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 480 mL, respiratory rate set at 26 breaths per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 29.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) at 25.1%, platelet count (Plt) at 549 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 3.7 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 17 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) at 145 mEq/L, potassium (K+) at 4.2 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) at 110 mEq/L, calcium (Ca2+) at 8.4 mg/dL, glucose at 124 mg/dL, C-reactive protein (CRP) at 71 mg/dL, procalcitonin (PCT) at 32.3 ng/mL, and lactate at 1.9 mmol/L. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and sputum culture shows 2+ budding yeast. The urine culture is also pending.

The patient has a history of acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR), diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia, hypertension (HTN), and gallstone pancreatitis. The patient is currently receiving treatment for fever of unknown origin (FUO), respiratory failure, acute pancreatitis, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. The patient's goals of care include updating the family on patient status and providing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include worsening respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), further deterioration of renal function leading to uremia, development of a central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), progression of pancreatitis with possible pancreatic necrosis or pseudocyst formation, and worsening of anemia and electrolyte imbalances.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to guide further management."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - continue current ventilator setting as pt appears comfortable.
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at 40cc/hr
   - continue TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF. s/p 1L free water
   (250cc boluses Q6H) yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. TSH pending but previously has been normal. TSH 2.2
   (normal). discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to respond to
   it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB

   hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting
   of sepsis and acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started
   insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 s/p 1u pRBC yesterday. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.

   CXR from today (my read): volume overload worse than yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.
   - continue current ventilator setting as pt appears comfortable.
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr, CXR
   remarkably look better today even though pt had no HD session yesterday
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 CT abd unchanged, still has massive
   inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or
   presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP
   x2 which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.  Pt has
   post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at 40cc/hr
   - continue TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers. s/p 1L free water (250cc boluses Q6H) yesterday
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 s/p 1u pRBC yesterday. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - Follow Hct daily
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - diltiazem 30mg QID started today
   - HD per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure on HD, and a history of COPD, gallstone pancreatitis, and chronic renal failure. The patient has been experiencing daily fevers, metabolic acidosis, poor mental status, pleural effusion, hypernatremia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia, and hypertension (HTN).

The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F) and current temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 168/59 mmHg to 184/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator, and weight of 103.8 kg (admission weight: 88.6 kg). The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including pantoprazole, heparin sodium, diltiazem, insulin subcutaneously, and hemodialysis. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and altered liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support due to weakness,"

   Assessment and Plan
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Continues in sinus rhythm.  Continues
   diltiazem.
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA): Secondary to
   severe pancreatitis.  Off antibiotics.  Recultured today for T >102.
   Does not appear toxic, hemodynamically stable. Hold on antibiotics.
   Repeat C. Diff.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   baseline BUN/creatinine 26-27/1.4-1.5.  No clear indicatiion for
   dialysis. As per renal will porceed with trial of lasix for total body
   fluid overload.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE:  Continue to titrate up tube feeds, if able to
   discontinue TPN will help with total body fluid overload.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Main factors limiting
   wean is underlying COPD, postive fluid balance and persistent abdominal
   distention, metabolic acidosis.  Plan to start lasix today.  MDIs.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  Continues on dilaudid prn.
 ANXIETY/DEPRESSION:  Intermittently anxious, tearful this am.  Latter
   may have been related to poor NGT placement.  Seemed to improve affect
   when repositioned.  [**Month (only) 51**] benefit from anxiolytic.
 ANEMIA:  Hct did not increase in setting of transfusion but he was
   also another 1.7 L positive overnight.  [**Month (only) 51**] still be dilutional.  On a
   PPI.   Continue to monitor CBC, if this continues to trend down will
   repeat CT scan.  Guaiac all stools.  Starting epogen.
 H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Continues off the insulin drip.
   On insulin with coverage on sliding scale.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Improving with free water replacement.
 HYPERTENSION:  Adequately controlled.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF, currently at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - d/c TPN now that TF is at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held for the past few days but will get HD
   today
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hod the morning dose, restart after HD
   if BP good
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus x1
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - HD today
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO with HD today
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - consider another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - continue diltiazem 30mg QID
   - HD currently held per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary this am.
   - started on seroquel
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, daily fevers, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and poor mental status. The patient also has a pleural effusion.
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone obstructive pancreatitis. He has undergone ERCP procedures but still has massive inflammation in the abdomen without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had daily high fevers despite being off all antibiotics. No source of infection has been identified after a full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, and line change.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. His creatinine levels are stable, and he is producing good urine output. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
5. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible losses from fevers.
6. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyperphosph"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD currently held for stable Cr
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF, currently at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - d/c TPN now that TF is at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - Maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held as pt appears to be stable
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID
   - Continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus x1
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today as Hct continues to trend down
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - consider another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - continue diltiazem 30mg QID
   - HD currently held per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary this am.
   - started on seroquel
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been experiencing daily fevers and requires ventilator support. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has undergone ERCP procedures. His blood cultures have been negative, and he has been on various antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He also has acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, agitation/anxiety, and goals of care discussed with the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and poor mental status. The ventilator settings will be adjusted based on the patient's comfort and regular ABGs will be obtained.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure. His serum creatinine levels are elevated, and he has been on hemodialysis (HD). Lasix has been initiated to promote diuresis. The cause of renal failure may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN).

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had daily fevers despite extensive workup, including cultures, T"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF, currently at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - d/c TPN now that TF is at 40cc/hr
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart after HD
   if BP good
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 Most likely secondary to TPN or TF or insensible loss
   from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus x1
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - continue dilt 30mg QID, consider switching to metoprolol later as BB
   has more cardioprotective effect
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue sc insulin
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO with HD today
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - consider another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   .
   * HTN
 better controlled now. Initially noted to be more elevated
   after propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to
   volume overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure.
   Holding atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - continue diltiazem 30mg QID
   - HD currently held per renal
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary this am.
   - started on seroquel
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a tracheostomy in place, and is receiving post-pyloric feeding through a feeding tube. The patient has been febrile for several days and has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics. His renal function is stable, but he has hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and anemia of inflammation. He also has hyperglycemia, likely due to stress or TPN. The patient has hypertension, which may be related to volume overload or renal insufficiency. He is experiencing agitation and anxiety. The patient's underlying COPD needs to be treated with MDIs, and he has a history of atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires ongoing ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis, poor mental status, and pleural effusion. The ventilator settings need to be monitored and adjusted as necessary.

2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone obstructive pancreatitis, with ongoing inflammation in the abdomen. No evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts has been found. TF (total parenteral nutrition) should continue at the goal rate of 40cc/hr, and TPN should be discontinued.

   Assessment and Plan
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA):  No new culture
   data, now off antibiotics greater than 48 hours.  Fever curve seems to
   be trending down albeit still febrile.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF):  Good response to
   lasix 40 mg IV x 3, 2.7 L negative.   Bump in BUN/Cr likely reflects
   that we have been too aggressive.  Holding lasix this morning, also
   blood pressure trending down.  Hold on hemodialysis.  Consider starting
   lasix drip later today.  Phosporus increased, start phos binder.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Sodium trending up again.  Continue to replete free
   water deficit and follow labs.
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE:  Abdominal exam unchanged.  Now on tube feeds at
   goal.  Continues off antibiotics, following surveillence cultures.
   Following electrolytes, daily bladder pressures.
 NUTRITION:  Tube feeds on hold given suctioned tube feeds from NGT
   this am.  Will start a motility [**Doctor Last Name **] - emycin.  Check residuals.
   Start at lower rate.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  Has started to diurese
   which will help improve his respiratory status and facilitate weaning
   from mechanical ventilation.  No secretions.  Abdomen continues to be
   distended which is also compromising his respiratory status.
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN):  No grimacing with deep
   palpation of abdomen, seems well controlled.  Continues on dilaudid.
 H/O CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS,
   EMPHYSEMA) WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION:  No wheezing on exam.
 H/O DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II: Now off TPN with insulin.  On
   glargine and RISS, increase glargine and monitor fingersticks.
 ANEMIA:  Hct initially went back up to 25 without intervention, down
   to 22.5 in setting of aggessive diuresis and negative fluid balance.
   Guaiac stools.  Trend hct.  Transfuse 1 u pRBCs. Continues PPI.  If hct
   doesn't bump appropriately will have low threshold to repeat abdominal
   scan, concerned for hemorrhagic pancreatitis.
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Continues in sinus rhythm on diltiazem.
   Now that blood pressure on the lower side will discontinue diltiazem
   and monitor.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and other comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and atrial fibrillation. He was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of severe pancreatitis. The patient's fever has been trending down, but he still has a fever. His blood pressure is low, and he is being diuresed with Lasix. The patient's creatinine level is slightly increased, indicating possible renal impairment. He is unable to wean off pressure support due to increased respiratory rate and discomfort. The patient's abdomen is distended, which is compromising his respiratory status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is slightly increased, indicating potential renal failure. His blood pressure is also low, and he is being diuresed with Lasix. It is important to monitor his renal function closely and consider hemodialysis if necessary.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by his inability to wean off pressure support and the presence of crackles in the dependent areas of his chest. Continuous monitoring of his respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygenation are crucial.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is trending up, indicating hypernatremia. Close monitoring of his electrolytes and repletion of free water deficit are necessary to correct"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 borderline high at 146 today. Most likely secondary
   to TPN or TF or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   * HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   * Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been experiencing daily fevers, and no source of infection has been identified after a full workup. The patient has been on various antibiotics but is now off all antibiotics. He has a tracheostomy and is dependent on the ventilator. His condition is complicated by hypotension, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, agitation/anxiety, and thrush.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and poor mental status. Monitoring and adjusting ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone obstructive pancreatitis, with ongoing inflammation in the abdomen. There is no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. A repeat CT abdomen without IV contrast is planned.

3. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has daily fevers despite being off all antibiotics. No identifiable pathogen has been found after a thorough workup, including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, and line change. Further evaluation and management of FUO are needed.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 borderline high at 146 today. Most likely secondary
   to TPN or TF or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   * HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   * Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, has a tracheostomy, post-pyloric feeding tube, and nasogastric tube in place. He also has renal failure requiring hemodialysis and is being treated for acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts on repeat CT abdomen without IV contrast. He has undergone two ERCP procedures, which showed gallstone obstructive pancreatitis.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored, with ventilator settings changed to pressure support mode (PS) due to his increased drive to ventilate. The patient is also being treated for fever of unknown origin (FUO) related to severe pancreatitis, with ongoing cultures and antibiotic coverage.

The patient's renal function is unstable, with borderline high sodium levels and hyperphosphatemia likely secondary to acute on chronic renal failure. He is being managed with fluid restriction, diuretics, and hemodialysis.

Other medical complications include hypotension, hyperglycemia, anemia, hypertension, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and anxiety. The patient is being treated with appropriate medications and interventions for these conditions.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex and requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems"

   CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has increasing
   bilateral pleural effusion. Patient comfortable on PS , currently at
   14/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], second session scheduled for today
   despite improving renal function.
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, continue erythromycin to enhance GI
   motility.  Tube connected to suction.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 18, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high overnight with high of 101.2.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.

   base, cannot be excluded.
   3. Unchanged pneumobilia with decreased air within the gallbladder
   secondary to the presence of stent catheters.
   CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   # Hypernatremia
high at 152 today. Most likely secondary to TPN or TF
   or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   # Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   # HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   1. Extensive pancreatitis with peripancreatic fat-stranding and

   prior. Evaluation for hemorrhagic necrosis is not possible given the
   lack of IV contrast.
   2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
   atelectasis, however, superimposed infection, particularly at the left
   base, cannot be excluded.
   3. Unchanged pneumobilia with decreased air within the gallbladder
   secondary to the presence of stent catheters.
   CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 borderline high at 146 today. Most likely secondary
   to TPN or TF or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   * HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   * Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   CT abd (prelim)
   1. Extensive pancreatitis with peripancreatic fat-stranding and
   intraabdominal fluid, similar in appearance to examination three days
   prior. Evaluation for hemorrhagic necrosis is not possible given the
   lack of IV contrast.
   2. Increased bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive
   atelectasis, however, superimposed infection, particularly at the left
   base, cannot be excluded.
   3. Unchanged pneumobilia with decreased air within the gallbladder
   secondary to the presence of stent catheters.
   CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 Currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has pleural
   effusion. Respiratory rate higher than the set rate, possibly as pt has
   a increased drive to ventilate as he has metabolic acidosis, and as
   patient has been fevers.  Ventilator setting was changed to PS this AM,
   currently at 16/10
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 borderline high at 146 today. Most likely secondary
   to TPN or TF or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   * HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   * Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], HD has been held for stable Cr, but per
   renal, may dialyze today
   - per renal, IV lasix 40mg TID, but hold the morning dose as pt will
   get HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   * Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts but the scan had no IV
   contrast. Pt is s/p ERCP x2 which showed gallstone obstructive
   pancreatitis.  Pt has post-pyloric feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, will start erythromycin to enhance GI
   motiligy
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - continue TF, was at goal rate of 40cc/hr, given possible NGT output
   of TF, will decrease TF rate for now
   - d/c TPN
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently < 15
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   .# FUO
 Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were peeled off on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   * Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], HD held today for volume depletion
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   - per renal, lasix 40mg IV TID, hold the morning dose, restart lasix if
   BP good---consider lasix gtt
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   * Hypotension
 likely secondary to lasix use yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - no HD today
   - 500cc NS bolus, 1u pRBC today for volume repletion and hypotension
   .
   * Hypernatremia
 borderline high at 146 today. Most likely secondary
   to TPN or TF or insensible loss from fevers.
   - 250cc free water bolus Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   .
   * Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - consider calcium acetate, f/u  renal recs
   .
   * Afib with RVR
  Most likely secondary to the fevers, pain and
   inflammatory state. discontinued IV metoprolol as pt did not seem to
   respond to it well. started dilt 30mg QID.
   - dit is held give hypotension
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   * DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   * Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - start EPO today per renal
   - send another c. diff
   - guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   - CT scan if pm hct is again low at around 22
   .
   * HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - hold diltiazem 30mg QID
   - Hold
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   * Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   * Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   * Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis. He has been experiencing daily fevers, and his respiratory status has been unstable. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, and his abdominal CT scan shows extensive pancreatitis with peripancreatic fat stranding and intraabdominal fluid. There are also increased bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent compressive atelectasis. The patient has undergone an ERCP procedure. He is currently on ventilatory support and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's blood glucose levels have been elevated, indicating possible diabetes mellitus. He also has hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and anemia of inflammation. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and has had multiple blood cultures drawn. His blood pressure has been fluctuating, and he has been receiving Lasix for volume depletion. The patient's pain is being managed with Dilaudid, and he is also on erythromycin for gut motility. His mental status is fluctuating, and he is agitated and anxious. The patient has thrush in his mouth.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The patient has severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs show a fever, increased heart rate, and low blood pressure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, elevated troponin levels, and signs of acute kidney injury. The blood glucose levels are also elevated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest the possibility of an infection. This could be due to the severe pancreatitis or other underlying conditions.

2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and low oxygen saturation levels indicate a risk for developing ARDS. This condition can lead to significant lung dysfunction and require specialized care.

3. Dialysis: The patient's renal failure indicates a need for dialysis to manage the acute kidney injury and remove excess fluid from the body.

4. Complications related to pancreatitis: Severe pancreatitis can lead to various complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and abscesses. These complications may require further interventions and management.

5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots. Prophylactic measures such"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has increasing
   bilateral pleural effusion from CT. Patient comfortable on PS ,
   currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], third session scheduled for today as per
   renal due to increasing BUN and hypernatremia.
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, continue erythromycin to enhance GI
   motility.  Tube connected to suction.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - hold TF until fluoro test for post pyloric tube [**Month/Day (4) 3117**] completed
   today.  If no [**Last Name (LF) 3117**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] advance TF to goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high overnight with high of 101.2.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**]
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
 stable BP overnight.  Likely secondary to lasix use
   yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - s/p 500cc NS bolus and 1u pRBC yesterday for volume repletion and
   hypotension
   .
   # Hypernatremia
high at 148 today. Most likely secondary to TPN or TF
   or insensible loss from fevers.
   - per renal, increased 250cc free water bolus to 500cc Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - f/u another c. diff
   - f/u guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   .
   # HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   # Hypernatremia
high at 152 today. Most likely secondary to TPN or TF
   or insensible loss from fevers.
   - per renal, increased 250cc free water bolus to 500cc Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate

   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]

   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin

   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with presentation with severe pancreatitis secondary to
   gallstones now with persistent renal and respiratory failure.  He has
   perssitence of fevers without clear and obvious source and is left with
   modest volume overload persisting.  He has persistently elevated
   ventilatory support requirements and continued fever.
   1)Respiratory Failure-_Tracheostomy in place with continued restriction
   from abdomen and possible pleural effusions contributing.  He maintains
   a high RR and mild respiratory alkalosis.
   -Will need continued volume removal
   -Will maintain PSV
   3)Pancreatitis-Persistent on CT scan and with ongoing fevers.
   -Tube feeds to be confirmed by evaluation for in tact post-pyloric tube
   -IF adequate will maintain post pyloric tube feeds
   -Dilaudid for pain control
   -Bladder pressure at 16 today
will follow in the setting of volume
   removal
   3)Renal Failure-Persistent but with some trend down in Cr in the
   setting of dialysis-
   -Continue dialysis
   -Follow Urine output
   -Will look to bring down BUN and normalize electrolytes via HD
   4)Fever
do not see suggestion of systemic insult or focal source of
   infection
   -Follow culture
   -Antibiotics for evolution of clear focal source of infection.
   Additional issues to be managed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis secondary to gallstones, persistent renal and respiratory failure, and fever. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and hypertension. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has a tracheostomy in place. He is receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric tube and is being monitored for fluid balance and electrolyte levels. The patient's condition remains unstable with ongoing fevers, high ventilatory support requirements, and volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's high respiratory rate and mild respiratory alkalosis indicate ongoing respiratory failure. This may require continued volume removal and maintenance of pressure support ventilation (PSV) to assist with breathing.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis is persistent on the CT scan, and he is experiencing ongoing fevers. This suggests that the pancreatitis is not resolving and may continue to cause systemic inflammation. The patient's pain control needs to be addressed with Dilaudid for comfort.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function remains impaired, as indicated by the persistent elevated creatinine levels. Continued dialysis will be necessary to manage the renal failure and normalize electrolyte levels.
4. Fever: The patient has persistent fevers without a clear source of infection. This could be due to various causes such as bacterial infection"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt is off
   propofol currently.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement. Barriers
   to extubation is mainly volume overload in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Unfortunately  diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension
   limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient comfortable on PS
   , currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - decrease PEEP from 10 to 5 or 8 and assess respiratory status
   - start lasix gtt today
   - Albumin 25% (12.5g / 50mL) 12.5 g IV Q6HRS to maintain intracellular
   volume
   - no HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   - restart albuterol (originally held for afib)
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  As per nurse, patient seems to be
   passing more gas with erythromycin.
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - continue erythromycin to enhance GI motility.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high yesterday with high of 99.6.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - consider CVVH for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Likely secondary to lasix use and HD
   - change lasix to gtt
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine and ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - 1u pRBC today as pt is anemic and hypotensive
   - f/u guaiac stool
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). The patient is still ventilator-dependent due to volume overload and acute renal failure. The abdominal distension also impairs lung expansion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may worsen if the volume overload and abdominal distension are not managed effectively.
2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further if the underlying cause of acute renal failure is not addressed.
3. Hypotension: The patient is likely to experience hypotension due to lasix use and HD, which can lead to inadequate organ perfusion.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels may become imbalanced due to free water replacement or insensible losses from fevers.
5. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient may develop elevated phosphate levels due to acute renal failure.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen due to ongoing blood loss or inadequate erythropoietin production.
7. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged ICU stay, use of indwelling lines, and immunosuppression from severe pancreatitis.

These potential complications should be closely monitored and managed appropriately to optimize the patient's outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has increasing
   bilateral pleural effusion from CT. Patient comfortable on PS ,
   currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], third session scheduled for today as per
   renal due to increasing BUN and hypernatremia.
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, held albuterol this AM  for
   Afib
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, continue erythromycin to enhance GI
   motility.  Tube connected to suction.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - hold TF until fluoro test for post pyloric tube [**Month/Day (4) 3117**] completed
   today.  If no [**Last Name (LF) 3117**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] advance TF to goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high overnight with high of 101.2.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**]
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
 stable BP overnight.  Likely secondary to lasix use
   yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - s/p 500cc NS bolus and 1u pRBC yesterday for volume repletion and
   hypotension
   .
   # Hypernatremia
high at 148 today. Most likely secondary to TPN or TF
   or insensible loss from fevers.
   - per renal, increased 250cc free water bolus to 500cc Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 132/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and is receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). He has been experiencing daily fevers, and his blood cultures have been negative. The patient is also dealing with hypernatremia, hypotension, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, diabetes mellitus, anemia, hypertension, agitation, and anxiety.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include weakness, metabolic acidosis, uremia, and poor mental status. The patient also has increasing bilateral pleural effusion, which may impede lung expansion.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis, likely secondary to gallstones. There is massive inflammation in the abdomen, but no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his creatinine levels are elevated. He is currently undergoing hemodialysis sessions.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt has
   continued ventilator requirement. Barriers to extubation include
   weakness and metabolic acidosis in the setting of uremia and poor
   mental status. Pt is off propofol currently. Pt also has increasing
   bilateral pleural effusion from CT. Patient comfortable on PS ,
   currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - continue current ventilator PS setting as pt appears comfortable,
   continue to monitor and get regular ABGs
   - consider decreasing PS
   - first HD session began [**9-29**], third session scheduled for today as per
   renal due to increasing BUN and hypernatremia.
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   - restart albuterol (originally held for afib)
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  As per nurse, patient seems to be
   passing more gas with erythromycin.
   - suspect NGT getting TF out, continue erythromycin to enhance GI
   motility.  Tube connected to suction.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - may advance TF to goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high overnight with high of 99.6.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is stable, UOP
   is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**]
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if back on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
 stable BP overnight.  Likely secondary to lasix use
   yesterday
   - hold lasix for now
   - hold dilt for now
   - s/p 500cc NS bolus and 1u pRBC yesterday for volume repletion and
   hypotension
   .
   # Hypernatremia
high at 148 today. Most likely secondary to TPN or TF
   or insensible loss from fevers.
   - per renal, increased 250cc free water bolus to 500cc Q6H
   - continue to monitor
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine from 24u to 28u, continue ISS
   - monitor closely when d/c TPN as it contained insulin
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - f/u another c. diff
   - f/u guaiac stool
   - check Hct again this PM
   - give another unit pRBC
   - IV PPI
   .
   # HTN
 Now hypotensive. Initially noted to be more elevated after
   propofol was off, could be secondary to pain. Also secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute on chronic renal failure. Holding
   atenolol in setting of renal insufficiency.
   - dilaudid for pain control as BP worsens with pain
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with admission with severe pancreatitis and now complicated
   by persistent respiratory and renal failure.  Patient has not been able
   to tolerate negative fluid balance with significant hypotension in the
   setting of attempts yesterday.  Has some improvement in mental status
   today
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -PSV to continue with high level of support required in the setting of
   volume overload and abdominal distension
   -His acidosis is improved
   -Patient with current limitations including restriction from chest wall
   with anasarca and ascites
   -Will trial decrease in PSV today while continuing to work to negative
   fluid balance and improved abdominal distention
   -[**Month (only) 51**] need to return to higher PSV level if failure
   2)Acute Renal Failure- baseline BUN/creatinine 26-27/1.4-1.5
   -Will continue with HD on schedule
   -Will trial Lasix gtt
   -If hypotension with dialysis will have to move to CVVH
   3)Pancreatitis, Acute- CT scan showed inflammation c/w pancreatitis,
   elevated LFTs with lipase up 4K, WBC 19K started on flagyl and
   levofloxacin .  Interestingly no fevers in past 24 hours noted,
   abdominal exam unchanged
   -No abx at this time
   -Tube feedings to resume
   -Fevers have diminshed across past 24 hours
   of 10 mgs of IV morphine at the ED, has been in pain for 3 days priot
   to admission unrelieved by tylenol and ibuprofen

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, a tracheostomy tube
   has
   been placed. The tube appears to be in correct position, the tip of the
   tube
   projects 5 cm above the carina. The nasogastric tube and the bilateral
   central venous access lines are unchanged. Also unchanged are the
   bilateral
   opacities and the bilateral pleural effusions. Unchanged size of the
   cardiac
   silhouette. In the lung parenchyma, there is no evidence of newly
   occurred
   focal parenchymal opacities suggesting pneumonia.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt is off
   propofol currently.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement. Barriers
   to extubation is mainly volume overload in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Unfortunately  diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension
   limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient comfortable on PS
   , currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - decrease Fi)2 as tolerated
   - dc Lasix gtt today
   - CVVH today to take off volume
   - d/c Albumin q6h and see how BPs do
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  As per nurse, patient seems to be
   passing more gas with erythromycin.
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - continue erythromycin to enhance GI motility
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - CVVH today for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Likely secondary to lasix use and HD
   - d/c lasix gtt since plan for CVVH
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt is off
   propofol currently.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement. Barriers
   to extubation is mainly volume overload in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Unfortunately  diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension
   limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient comfortable on PS
   , currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - decrease PEEP from 10 to 5 or 8 and assess respiratory status
   - start lasix gtt today
   - Albumin 25% (12.5g / 50mL) 12.5 g IV Q6HRS to maintain intracellular
   volume
   - no HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   - restart albuterol (originally held for afib)
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  As per nurse, patient seems to be
   passing more gas with erythromycin.
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - continue erythromycin to enhance GI motility.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high yesterday with high of 99.6.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - consider CVVH for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Likely secondary to lasix use and HD
   - change lasix to gtt
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine and ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - 1u pRBC today as pt is anemic and hypotensive
   - f/u guaiac stool
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 93 beats per minute, blood pressure of 105/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is on furosemide (Lasix) infusion at 18 mg/hr, as well as other medications such as heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count (24.7), hemoglobin (27.5), and platelet count (394). His blood cultures are pending, while sputum and urine cultures have shown no growth. Imaging studies reveal massive inflammation in the abdomen without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.

The patient's condition is complicated by several medical issues, including respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, fever of unknown origin (FUO), hypotension, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR), diabetes mellitus (DM), and anemia.

The patient is currently receiving aggressive treatment for his various conditions, including diuresis with Lasix, hemodialysis (HD), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), pain management with opioids, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's care team is monitoring his progress closely and adjusting his treatment plan as necessary."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Pt is off
   propofol currently.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement. Barriers
   to extubation is mainly volume overload in the setting of acute renal
   failure. Unfortunately  diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension
   limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient comfortable on PS
   , currently at 14/10.  Abdominal distension also likely impeding lung
   expansion.
   - decrease PEEP from 10 to 5 or 8 and assess respiratory status
   - start lasix gtt today
   - Albumin 25% (12.5g / 50mL) 12.5 g IV Q6HRS to maintain intracellular
   volume
   - no HD today
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs
   - restart albuterol (originally held for afib)
   - continue to be off propofol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  As per nurse, patient seems to be
   passing more gas with erythromycin.
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - continue erythromycin to enhance GI motility.
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures daily, currently 16, worsening abdominal
   distention.  HD session should help remove some fluid.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
 Fever not as high yesterday with high of 99.6.  Most likely
   related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of infection after full
   workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on vanc,
   zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x 72hrs for
   meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   - continue treatment and monitoring as above for pancreatitis
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - consider CVVH for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Likely secondary to lasix use and HD
   - change lasix to gtt
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - maintain good pain control with dilaudid
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine and ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down. The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - 1u pRBC today as pt is anemic and hypotensive
   - f/u guaiac stool
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family on patient status

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). He has been experiencing daily fevers, and no source of infection has been identified after a full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, and line change. The patient is currently off propofol and comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PSV), with a PEEP of 10 cmH2O. He has a tracheostomy in place. The patient's abdominal distension is likely impeding lung expansion. He has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, COPD, acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFR), diabetes mellitus, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. Barriers to extubation include volume overload and acute renal failure. Decreasing PEEP from 10 to 5 or 8 should be assessed, and albumin 25% (12.5g/50mL) should be given IV q6hrs to maintain intracellular volume.
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, but there is no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts on repeat CT abdomen without IV contrast."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male admitted initially with severe pancreatitis now with
   hospital course complicated by significant and persistent ventilatory
   failure, renal failure and ongoing abdominal distention and compromise.
   1)Renal Failure-He certainly has need for ongoing negative fluid
   balance and this has been effected with intermittent HD but and lasix
   gtt and will move to CVVH if not able to maintain stable and
   signfiicant negative fluid balance without compromise of renal
   function.
   -HD today
   -Goal for even to mild negative fluid balance
   2)Respiratory Failure-Move to PSV has been reasonably tolerated and
   will continue to wean support as tolerated.  Have made progress to
   [**11-3**] with good effective ventilation.  Do have PO2 increased to 87.
   Of concern is patient with significant increase in secretions.
   -Trial of decrease in FIO2 today
   -Will decrease PSV to 8 today as goal
   -Will be restrictive defect leaving tolerance of trach mask trial
   limited.
   -Continue atrovent/fluticasone
   -Lasix gtt at 20mg/hr
   -For recurrent fevers will have to consider implementation of
   antibiotics for possible pneumonia in the setting of
   3)Pancreatitis-
   -Will continue with tube feeds at post pyloric tube
   -Follow exam
   -Does have WBC count decreased over past two days as well despite
   recurrent fever.
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. He has edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count and blood glucose levels. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if he does not tolerate weaning off the ventilator or if there are further complications such as pneumonia.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate if fluid balance is not maintained or if there is ongoing renal insult.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may progress and lead to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Infection: The patient's recurrent fever suggests an ongoing infection, which could be due to pneumonia or another source.
5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate cardiovascular compromise, which could be a result of sepsis or other systemic effects.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based solely on the provided progress note, and additional information from other sources may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued
   ventilator requirement. Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD
   causes hypotension limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient
   continued on CVVH which is less prone to cause hypotension.  Patient
   comfortable on PS , currently at 15/10, FiO2 weaned to 40%.
   - dc Lasix gtt and albumin yesterday
   - continue CVVH
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - continue erythromycin to enhance GI motility
   - when pt is on erythromycin and risperdol, get daily EKGs to monitor
   for QT prolongation
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  No source of
   infection after full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line
   change. Pt was on vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was
   on meropenem x 72hrs for meropenem. Pt continues to have daily high
   fevers.
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - leukocytosis trending down
   - tylenol for fever
   - cool pt down when he has fevers, with cooling blankets, ice packs,
   fans etc
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Likely secondary to lasix use and HD
   - CVVH
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine and ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down, s/p 1 unit PRBC transfusion with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - 1u pRBC today as pt is anemic and hypotensive
   - guaiac stool neg
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]).  Likely
   secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued
   ventilator requirement. Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD
   causes hypotension limiting the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient
   continued on CVVH which is less prone to cause hypotension.  Patient
   comfortable on PS , currently at 15/10, FiO2 weaned to 40%.
   - will perform therapeutic tap today given worsening pleural effusion
   on cxr
   - dc
ed Lasix gtt and albumin yesterday
   - continue CVVH
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr
   - discontinue erythromycin, as pt had diarrhea last night.
   - TPN discontinued
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # FUO
Most likely related to severe pancreatitis.  Afebrile overnight,
   but may also be hypothermic from CVVH.  No source of infection after
   full workup including cultures, TTE, CT sinus, line change. Pt was on
   vanc, zosyn and cipro for 8 days for VAP. Also, was on meropenem x
   72hrs for meropenem.
   - leukocytosis lowered
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - ID signed off, appreciate their recommendations
   - F/u BCx, urine culture and sputum culture
   - tylenol for fever
   - maintain MAP> 65, monitor CVPs
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Renal following. Cr is improving,
   UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for stable BP while removing excess fluid
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per HD protocol if on HD
   .
   # Hypotension
  Resolved with o/n MAP > 65.  Likely secondary to lasix
   use and HD
   - continue CVVH
   - continue metoprolol with holding parameters
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # DM
Has been hyperglycemic on TPN. Other causes for hyperglycemia
   include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and
   acute illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**]
   (fixed glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine and ISS
   - will increase glargine to 30 units qhs due to increased blood sugars
   during the day.
   .
   # Anemia
 trending down, s/p 1 unit PRBC transfusion with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - 1u pRBC today as pt is anemic and hypotensive
   - guaiac stool neg
   - IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: Pt was teary.
   - started on risperidol
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure and volume overload. The patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is being treated with medication and tracheostomy. He has a worsening right-sided pleural effusion and is expected to undergo therapeutic tapping. The patient's fever of unknown origin (FUO) has improved, and all antibiotics have been discontinued. His anemia is likely related to inflammation, and he is receiving erythropoietin. The patient's agitation and anxiety are being treated with risperidone. He also has thrush, for which he is receiving nystatin.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which may lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper bundle care and adherence to VAP prevention strategies are essential.
2. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, and CVVH is being used to manage his fluid overload. Monitoring electrolyte levels and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is crucial.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated, which may be related to tube feedings or insensible losses from fevers. Close monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is important.
4. Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has"

   Imaging: CXR--persistence of very large pleural effusions bilaterally
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with admission with severe pancreatitis and now with ongoing
   complications of respiratory failure, renal failure and persistent
   pancreatitis.  He has initiation of CVVH in the setting of persistent
   volume overload limiting capacity to move towards liberation from the
   ventilator.
   1)Pancreatitis-Patient has improvement and persistence of improvement
   in his pancreatice and liver associated enzymes.
   -Continue post pyloric feeds
   -Follow enzymes and exam
   -He has had decrease in fever
   -Has tolerated diuresis
   2)Respiratory Failure-he has primary limitation of significant pleural
   effusions limiting capacity to maintain air-space patency.  The
   argument is reasonable that ongoing pancreatic inflammation is in large
   part diminished and he is at risk for persistent hypoxemia and
   complications of ongoing ventilator support.
   -Will continue with CVVH support
   -Will continue with negative fluid balance
   -Move to drainage of effusions today with thoracentesis
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH
   -Look for fluid removal
   -Will continue to look for improvement in intrinsic renal function
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, ongoing complications of respiratory failure, renal failure, and persistent pancreatitis. He has been admitted with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.0 C (100.4 F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 of 40%, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, and PSV of 15 cmH2O. The patient has a history of fever, with a maximum temperature of 100.4 F. He is receiving intravenous antibiotics (erythromycin) and has been initiated on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to persistent volume overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary limitation is significant pleural effusions, which are causing hypoxemia and potential complications of ongoing ventilator support. Effusion drainage via thoracentesis is planned today.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's baseline BUN/creatinine levels are elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. CVVH support will continue to address fluid removal and improve intrinsic renal function.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatic enzymes (amylase/lipase) are elevated, indicating persistent inflammation. Continued monitoring and management of pancreatic function are necessary.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level indicates anemia. Further investigation and management are required.
5. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient's persistent fever needs further evaluation to identify the underlying cause.
6. Pain Control: The patient has reported acute and chronic pain, for which pain management strategies should be implemented.
7. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient's diabetes control should be monitored and managed appropriately.
8. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure should be monitored and managed to maintain optimal control.
9. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient's COPD exacerbation requires ongoing management and optimization of respiratory support.
10. Fluid Balance: The patient has a significant fluid balance deficit, requiring careful monitoring and management.

Please note that this summary and list of potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional are necessary for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning."

   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, daily fevers, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He has a tracheostomy and is receiving post-pyloric tube feeds. The patient's pleural effusion is exudative and likely due to tracking from ascites associated with pancreatitis. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) is being continued for fluid removal. The patient's underlying COPD is being treated with MDIs (metered-dose inhalers) including albuterol. There are no signs of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts on the repeat CT abdomen. The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation in the setting of acute disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. He is currently comfortable on pressure support ventilation (PS) at 15/12, FiO2 40%. 
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension was likely secondary to lasix use and HD. CVVH is being continued while monitoring for stable blood pressure.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient is on CVVH and renal follow-up is being continued. The cause"

   CXR: my read: worsening right sided pleural effusion compared to right
   after [**Female First Name (un) 217**]. Left sided pleural effusion stable
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - change ventilator setting to pressure support, [**1-3**], get ABG to
   monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is even I/Os
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  erythromycin d/c
d on [**10-9**]
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - no fever for 2 days, but patient has been on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving, UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos
   neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - d/c metoprolol
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine to 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - started on risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis now with prolonged
   course compliacted by persistent respiratory failure and renal
   failure.  He has had tolerance of negative fluild balance with
   thoracentesis and CVVH across past 24 hours--urine flow, however, has
   been quite marginal.
   1)Pancreatitis-No evidence of fevers noted, WBC count remains mildly
   elevated but enzymes have substantially normalized
   -Continue to monitor fever curve
   -continue with tube feeds
   2)Respiratory Failiure-Did have clear and complete removal of fluid
   from right chest with thoracentesis.  However, there was little change
   in effective ventilation and no capacity to decrease the intensity of
   ventilatory support.  In addition, there is significant evidence of
   return of fluild into the right chest on the film of this morning.
   -Will move to wean PSV as possible today
   -Do not see clinical evidence of substantial and persistent improvement
   following thoracentesis which makes further procedures or catheter
   drainage chronically as likely to lead to earlier liberation from
   mechanical ventilation
   -Will move to [**Doctor First Name **] PSV today as tolerated
   2.5)Pleural effusion-Exudative, may be related both to capilllary leak
   and pancreatitis
   -Will follow cultures
   -Will not pursue further thoacentesis at this time
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Continue CVVH for volume removal is tolerated by blood pressure
   today.  He retains minimal urine flow and his negative fluid balance is
   really only able to be effected by stool and thoracenteiss fluid.
   -Even fluid balance is current goal.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged course of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient underwent thoracentesis and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) across the past 24 hours. There has been moderate improvement in overall mental status.

Assessment and Plan:
1) Pancreatitis: No evidence of fevers noted, WBC count remains mildly elevated but enzymes have substantially normalized.
- Continue to monitor fever curve
- Continue with tube feeds

2) Respiratory Failure: Did have clear and complete removal of fluid from right chest with thoracentesis. However, there was little change in effective ventilation and no capacity to decrease the intensity of ventilatory support. In addition, there is significant evidence of return of fluid into the right chest on the film of this morning.

CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - change ventilator setting to pressure support, [**8-29**], get ABG to
   monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is -500  I/Os
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - speech s/c today
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  erythromycin d/c
d on [**10-9**]
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - no fever for 3 days, but patient has been on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving, UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos
   neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -500
   - keep SBP >110 to prevent any further kidney damage, using pressors if
   necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - d/c metoprolol
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using levaphed as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine to 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including hypotension, hyperglycemia, anemia, agitation/anxiety, thrush, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the patient is being monitored for this condition. Measures such as the VAP bundle are being implemented to prevent infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, which can lead to further renal damage. Pressors are being used as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 and systolic blood pressure (SBP) above 110.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) and is experiencing hyperglycemia. Insulin therapy is being used to manage blood glucose levels, and the dose of glargine has been increased to 34 units at bedtime.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which could be due to anemia of inflammation or acute blood loss. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - change ventilator setting to pressure support, [**1-3**], get ABG to
   monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is even I/Os
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  erythromycin d/c
d on [**10-9**]
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - dilaudid for pain control, and fentanyl bolus prn for pain as well
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - no fever for 2 days, but patient has been on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving, UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos
   neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of even
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - d/c metoprolol
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine to 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - started on risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Begun PO metoprolol 25mg TID
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, daily fevers, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis (HD). He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, type II diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a concern for ongoing hypotension and volume overload, which may require adjustment of ventilator settings and diuretic therapy.

2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to rhabdomyolysis and/or sepsis. CVVH is being used for fluid removal, but the patient remains intermittently hypotensive.

3. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and his blood glucose levels have been consistently over 200 mg/dL. Insulin therapy has been initiated to manage hyperglycemia.

4. Anemia: The patient is anemic, but the cause is unclear. Anemia of inflammation, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemolysis are potential causes. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

5. Thrush: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission for pancreatitis now with persistent
   respiratory failure--although able to tolerate some wean from the
   ventilator and renal faiure with CVVH continued. He has had continued
   difficulty with major fluid clearance across the day yesterday--in the
   setting of tap of effusion there was some return of fluid relatively
   quickly and continued taps without permanent drainge are not likely to
   have sustained benefit.  He may well have continued negative fluild
   balance as primary variable to move to successful liberation from
   ventilator.
   1)Respiratory Failure
   -PSV 12/5 this morning
   -Will have speech and swallow in to eval for possible PMV placement
   -Will move to wean further understanding limits primarily due to poor
   compliance with volume overload
   -Will trial tach mask when substantial decrease in PEEP well tolerated
   -Will move to [**5-29**] today x 30 minutes and move to trach mask trial.
   2)Renal Failure-
   -Continue with CVVH and will maintain blood pressure in acceptable
   level
   -Will keep MAP at 65 and SBP at 110 for aid in renal perfusion as
   possible.
   -Will use levophed as need to keep SBP >100
   -Will remove a-line and replace if intensive monitoring needed.
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/69 mmHg to 93/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and temperature of 35.8°C. The patient's weight has increased from 88.6 kg at admission to 98.2 kg currently.

The patient is receiving various medications, including KCl for CRRT, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's fluid balance shows a significant input of fluids and a negative output, indicating fluid overload.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, high potassium level, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and liver enzymes. The patient also has an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level and D-dimer level.

The patient's imaging shows no deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the right upper extremity. 

The assessment and plan highlight the patient's respiratory failure and renal failure. For respiratory failure, the plan is to continue with PSV mode, evaluate for possible tracheostomy"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - change ventilator setting to pressure support, [**8-29**], get ABG to
   monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is -500  I/Os
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - speech s/c today
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  erythromycin d/c
d on [**10-9**]
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - no fever for 3 days, but patient has been on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving, UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos
   neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -500
   - keep SBP >110 to prevent any further kidney damage, using pressors if
   necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   - send u/a from affluent bag (CVVH leak?)
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - d/c metoprolol
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using levaphed as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine to 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, daily fevers, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and has had a tracheostomy performed. The patient also has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, hypotension, diabetes mellitus, anemia, agitation/anxiety, thrush, hypernatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. Continuous ventilator requirement.
2. Hypotension: The patient intermittently experiences hypotension, which limits the amount of diuresis that can be done. CVVH is less prone to cause hypotension.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and the cause of AKI could be due to ATN, pre-renal azotemia, or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Urine eosinophils are negative.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has type II diabetes mellitus and other causes for hyperglycemia include pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute illness. Insulin therapy is being adjusted accordingly.
5. Anemia: The most"

   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and gallstone pancreatitis. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and COPD. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy in place. He is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) due to acute renal failure. The patient has had daily fevers, and a right-sided thoracentesis was performed, but the pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated. He is being treated with CVVH for fluid removal and goal is even I/Os. His labs show elevated WBC count, slightly elevated CRP, and elevated amylase and lipase levels. He has hypotension and is being supported with vasopressors. His Hct is stable, and he has received a recent PRBC transfusion with a robust response. He has been weaned off antibiotics and is now on insulin for glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to require ventilator support due to respiratory failure. Factors such as volume overload, acute renal failure, and abdominal distention may impede lung expansion.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient has acute renal failure, and ongoing monitoring of renal function is necessary. CVVH is being utilized for fluid removal and maintaining even I/Os.
3. Hypotension: The patient is"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis and now with
   persistent respiratory failure who in the setting of move to even fluid
   balance, inprovement in WBC count suggesting pancreatitis
   improving--fever is hard to follow with CVVH in place due to cooling
   effects.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient has been able to tolerate PSV at 5/5
   which represents a relatively minimal level of support and patient
   mental status does remain quite good.
   -Will move to trach mask trial today
   -Speech and swallow in to evaluate for trach mask trial today with
   valve if is able to tolerate in terms of secretion management.
   2)Pancreatitis-
   -Continue with tube feeds
   -Follow exam
   -Does appear to be diminished in part as active inflammation with
   systemic markers
   -Will have to discuss timing of repeat CT Abdomen--would certainly
   pursue for recurrence of symptoms of inflammation or decreased in
   hematocrit.
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Will be able to move to HD with continued stability--would favor
   continuation with CVVH as long as we see continued improvement.
   -Follow urine flow which has been markedly diminished in the setting of
   intermittent hypotension.
   -Will need to use pressor support until we can achieve a stable volume
   status as close to euvolemia as possible
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing intermittent decreases in blood pressure requiring pressor support. He is also showing signs of fatigue, tachypnea, and anemia. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, glipizide, atenolol, and terazosin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is already present and may worsen if there are further complications or if the current treatment is not effective.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving based on the decrease in white blood cell count, but there is still active inflammation with systemic markers. There is a risk of recurrence of symptoms or complications such as abscess formation or pseudocyst.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is also present and requires careful monitoring and management. There is a risk of further deterioration in kidney function or fluid imbalance due to the use of CVVH and intermittent hypotension.
4. Anemia: The patient is showing signs of anemia, which could be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other underlying causes. It"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis and now with
   persistent respiratory failure who in the setting of move to even fluid
   balance, inprovement in WBC count suggesting pancreatitis
   improving--fever is hard to follow with CVVH in place due to cooling
   effects.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient has been able to tolerate PSV at 5/5
   which represents a relatively minimal level of support and patient
   mental status does remain quite good.
   -Will move to trach mask trial today
   -Speech and swallow in to evaluate for trach mask trial today with
   valve if is able to tolerate in terms of secretion management.
   2)Pancreatitis-
   -Continue with tube feeds
   -Follow exam
   -Does appear to be diminished in part as active inflammation with
   systemic markers
   -Will have to discuss timing of repeat CT Abdomen--would certainly
   pursue for recurrence of symptoms of inflammation or decreased in
   hematocrit.
   3)Renal Failure-
   -Will be able to move to HD with continued stability--would favor
   continuation with CVVH as long as we see continued improvement.
   -Follow urine

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with initial admission for pancreatitis and now with persistent respiratory failure. The patient's condition has shown some improvement, including a decrease in WBC count suggesting improving pancreatitis. However, the patient still has several ongoing medical complications, including respiratory failure, renal failure, and anemia. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) due to multi-organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unable to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation on his own, necessitating mechanical ventilation. There is a plan to trial a tracheostomy mask today to evaluate for potential extubation.
2. Pancreatitis: The patient initially presented with acute pancreatitis, which appears to be improving based on the decreasing WBC count and systemic markers of inflammation. However, the patient may require repeat imaging (CT abdomen) if symptoms of inflammation recur or if there is a significant decrease in hematocrit.
3. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) is being continued, and there is a plan to transition to hemodialysis (HD) once the patient's condition stabilizes.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be related to chronic disease, blood loss, or other underlying causes. Further evaluation and"

CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis and daily fevers,
   respiratory failure, renal failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - change ventilator setting to pressure support, [**8-29**], get ABG to
   monitor respiratory status
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is -500  I/Os
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - speech s/c today
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  erythromycin d/c
d on [**10-9**]
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - no fever for 3 days, but patient has been on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving, UOP is good. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos
   neg x2.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -500
   - keep SBP >110 to prevent any further kidney damage, using pressors if
   necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - d/c metoprolol
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using levaphed as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 24u qhs+ISS)
   - increase glargine to 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hypernatremia
 resolved.  Most likely secondary to TF or insensible
   loss from fevers.
   - d/c free water boluses as pt is volume overloaded and Na is wnl
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and is being treated with CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration) for fluid removal. His renal function is improving, but he remains hypotensive and requires pressors to maintain blood pressure above 110 mmHg. The patient also has hyperglycemia due to type II diabetes and stress response, for which he is being treated with insulin. He has anemia of inflammation, hypernatremia resolved, hyperphosphatemia secondary to acute renal failure, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that is now in sinus rhythm.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there are further issues with lung expansion or ventilation.
2. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and is being treated with CVVH. There is a risk of further kidney damage if blood pressure is not maintained above 110 mmHg.

CXR today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - continue trials with trach collar
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is at least -1L  I/Os in lieu
   of 3L positive yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs concerning the balance between fluids and BP
   - add neo to maintain BP in setting of diuresis
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -1L
   - per renal, keep SBP >110 to prevent any further kidney damage, using
   pressors if necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - switch to neo from midodrine
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using neo as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 34u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine at 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - recheck Hct s/p 1 PRBC this morning
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed.
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis.
- He underwent a tracheostomy on 09/28 and a right-sided thoracentesis on 10/09. However, the pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in the right lung after thoracentesis, and the effect was not durable.
- The patient continues to be on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
- Diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension, limiting the amount of diuresis that can be given. The patient is being continued on CVVH, which is less prone to cause hypotension.
- The patient's underlying COPD is being treated with MDIs, including albuterol.
- The patient has gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. He has a post-pyloric feeding tube in place since 09/27.
- His renal function is improving, but he remains on CVVH with poor urine output. The differential diagnosis for acute kidney injury includes acute tubular necrosis, pre-renal azotemia, and allergic interstitial nephritis. Urine eosinophils are negative twice.
- The patient experiences intermittent hypotension and is being treated with CVVH and neo"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, fever of unknown origin, and pain control issues. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35°C (95°F), blood pressure of 79/40 mmHg (58/35 mmHg), heart rate of 72 bpm (71-93 bpm), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (16-30 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus rhythm.

The patient is receiving various medications and infusions, including heparin sodium, erythromycin, and ICU medications. He is also on a ventilator with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 455 mL (250-589 mL), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 61.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.9 K/uL (13.1 K/uL), anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL (24.8%), elevated glucose levels ranging from 221-258 mg/dL, and several other abnormalities in kidney and liver function tests.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and pancreatitis. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving supplemental oxygen at 40%. His vital signs include a temperature of 33.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 79/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's laboratory results show anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and elevated levels of lipase and amylase. The assessment and plan include anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may progress if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation, leading to further deterioration in his respiratory status.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may worsen if there is ongoing renal hypoperfusion or if the underlying cause of AKI is not appropriately managed.
3. Infection: Given the elevated white blood cell count and elevated inflammatory markers, there is a risk of developing or exacerbating an"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, acute renal failure (ARF), and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 33.9 degrees Celsius, blood pressure ranging from 58/35 to 79/40 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 16-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type II, atrial fibrillation, and COPD. The patient's current medications include insulin for diabetes, midodrine for hypotension, and neo for continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

The patient's lab results show elevated levels of WBC, glucose, troponin-T, CK, CKMB, D-dimer, and lactic acid, along with low levels of platelets, hemoglobin, and albumin. The patient's renal function tests indicate acute renal failure.

The patient's physical examination reveals tracheostomy with moderate respiratory distress, tachycardia, decreased breath sounds in the lungs, soft abdomen with positive bowel sounds, and trace edema in the extremities.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of type II diabetes mellitus, acute renal failure, pancreatitis, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments including CVVH, pressors, insulin, and tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the presence of multiple lines and tubes, including the arterial line, PICC line, dialysis catheter, and tracheostomy tube.
2. Bleeding: The patient's prolonged PTT and INR indicate a higher risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and watch for any signs of bleeding or bruising.
3. Hypotension: The patient's history of hypotension and use of vasopressor medications suggest a potential risk for ongoing hypotension. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure is necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible AKI. Monitoring renal function and adjusting fluid management and medications accordingly is crucial.
5. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and use of mechanical ventilation pose a risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory complications. Frequent assessment of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.
6. Pancreatitis Complications: Although the patient's pancreatitis has improved, there is still a risk for complications"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, renal failure, pancreatitis, COPD, and type II diabetes mellitus.

24-hour events include the placement of an arterial line, which was temporarily stopped and then restarted. The patient underwent CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemodialysis) and received transfusions.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 88.6 kg at admission to 97 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows an input of 5,577 mL and output of 3,077 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,500 mL. The patient has received a total of 3,984 mL of IV fluids.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including KCl, Phenylephrine, and other ICU medications. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating poorly controlled diabetes.

Lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels indicating renal dysfunction, and elevated blood urea nitrogen levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the note. However, based on the information provided, the patient is in the ICU and has several medical conditions. 

The patient has a tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. They are receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and have an arterial line. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 97 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 109/55 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 100% on room air. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the flowsheet data. The patient's weight is 97 kg, with a total fluid input of 5577 mL and output of 3077 mL. The patient is receiving medications including KCl, phenylephrine, and other ICU medications.

The patient's physical examination shows that they are trached, vented, interactive, and able to follow commands. They have minimal movement of extremities, heart sounds with regular rhythm, decreased lung sounds at the bases, and trace edema in the lower extremities.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.8 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.5 mg/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 213 mg/dL, and elevated D-dimer levels of 4923 ng/mL. Other labs are within normal range or do not show significant abnormalities.

The patient's chest X-ray shows large bilateral effusions, which are likely stable. 

The assessment and plan include leukocytosis with pending cultures and empirical PO vancomycin, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, acute pancreatitis, respiratory failure with effusions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypotension, and ongoing ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further decline in renal function, infection due to leukocytosis and use of invasive lines, and potential complications related to diabetes mellitus."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus type II, COPD, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and anemia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy since admission. Recent events include the placement of a new arterial line, initiation of CVVH (continuous veno-venous hemofiltration), and the administration of antibiotics due to leukocytosis.

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/55 mmHg to 127/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 88.6 kg at admission to 97 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,577 mL and output of 3,077 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.6 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 118 mg/dL to 258 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows large bilateral pleural effusions, likely stable.

CXR:
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  Continue to be
   on ventilator. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume
   overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention
   impeding lung expansion.  Pt has continued ventilator requirement.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.
   - continue trials with trach collar
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is at least -1L  I/Os in lieu
   of 3L positive yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs concerning the balance between fluids and BP
   - add neo to maintain BP in setting of diuresis
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -1L
   - per renal, keep SBP >110 to prevent any further kidney damage, using
   pressors if necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - switch to neo from midodrine
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using neo as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 34u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine at 34u qhs as glucose has been over 200
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - recheck Hct s/p 1 PRBC this morning
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed.
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis. He has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, right-sided thoracentesis, and post-pyloric feeding tube placement. The patient continues to require mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. Diuresis with lasix and hemodialysis has been limited by hypotension. The patient is currently on continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for fluid removal.

The patient also has gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. His liver function tests (LFTs) and amylase/lipase levels are being trended. He has been taking erythromycin and his calcium levels are being monitored daily.

Additionally, the patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with urine eosinophils negative x2. He is on CVVH and his creatinine levels are improving. The differential diagnosis includes acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). His urine output remains poor.

The patient's blood pressure has been intermittent and he is being managed with vasopressors. He has type II diabetes mellitus and his glucose levels have been over 200. Insulin therapy has been initiated"

   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is at least -1L  I/Os in lieu
   of 3L positive yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs concerning the balance between fluids and BP
   - add neo to maintain BP in setting of diuresis
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO Vanc
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -1L
   - per renal, keep SBP >100-110 to prevent any further kidney damage,
   using pressors if necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   - pt will need a tunnel catheter line in place for dialysis in near
   future
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - switched to neo from midodrine, continue neo as needed, wean as
   tolerated
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using neo as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 34u qhs+ISS)
   - blood glucose in 250s, incr glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on ventilatory support with a tracheostomy tube. He also has a post-pyloric feeding tube, NG tube, and Foley catheter in place. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and requires pressor support. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he is being managed with insulin. He has anemia and is receiving erythropoietin and IV PPI. He is also receiving treatment for thrush, hyperphosphatemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise due to the patient's underlying COPD and the need for weaning off the ventilator.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure and is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH). There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function if adequate fluid removal is not achieved.

3. Hypotension: The patient continues to be intermittently hypotensive despite being on CVVH. There is a risk of inadequate organ perfusion and further hypotension if pressor support is not maintained.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with intially severe pancreatitis, now with
   respiratory failure, renal failure and new sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt has elev WBC, is hypothermic.  Pt is hypotensive, and
   during rounds, was altered from baseline mental status.  Likely [**2-26**] to
   bactermia (gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters).  Source can be
   lines (most likely), lung, c diff, abdominal source, urine, sinusitis,
   skin, gallstones.
   - continue IV [**Month/Day (2) 339**] for gram positive cocci (will dose PRN to keep
   trough>15)
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] for empiric coverage for c diff
   - f/u on more c diff samples (currently neg x 1)
   - order stool studies/cultures to r/o other infections
   - add on cefepime and cipro to broaden coverage for possible VAP (incl
   double-coverage for pseudomonas)
   - remove current dialysis catheter line (CVVH is stopped for now
   anyway)
   - remove current PICC line
   - place CVL for access
   - f/u Lipase
   - f/u TTE
   .
   # GI bleed: most likely [**2-26**] c diff. pt now with guaic positive stools
   and residuals from tube feeds.
   - f/u c diff studies
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] empiric coverage
   - stop tube feeds for now
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - discontinue CVVH for fluid removal, as pt not tolerating it (low BPs)
   and need to remove dialysis catheter in setting of gram positive cocci
   bacteremia
   - continue mechanical ventilation, pt did not tolerate attempts to wean
   off of it
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Hypotension
  on neo, had to d/c CVVH today
   - continue neo, consider adding vasopressin if a second pressor is
   needed
   - gave 1L NS bolus this AM to maintain pressures
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using pressors as needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure

   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - discontinue CVVH today, remove dialysis catheter today

   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro

   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed

","Summary:
Mr. [Known Lastname 9611], an 83-year-old male, is currently in the ICU with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, COPD, gallstone pancreatitis, and diverticulosis. The patient is hypotensive, hypothermic, and altered from baseline mental status. He has elevated white blood cell count and positive gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on gram stain. The likely source of infection is the lines, but other potential sources include the lung, C. diff, abdomen, urine, sinusitis, skin, and gallstones.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI bleed: The patient has guaiac-positive stools and is being treated for C. diff, which may suggest a gastrointestinal bleed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of COPD. There is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to bacteria found in the sputum gram stain.
3. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, likely secondary to pancreatitis and hypotension. He is on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and has poor urine output.
4. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic infection with elevated white blood cell count and positive gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters on gram stain. He is being"

CXR: fluid overload bilat, stable from prior
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with intially severe pancreatitis, now with
   respiratory failure, renal failure and new sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt has elev WBC, is hypothermic.  Pt is hypotensive, and
   during rounds, was altered from baseline mental status.  Likely [**2-26**] to
   bactermia (gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters).  Source can be
   lines (most likely),
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.  Was briefly weaned off ventilator
   yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - continue trials with trach collar
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is at least -1L  I/Os in lieu
   of 3L positive yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs concerning the balance between fluids and BP
   - add neo to maintain BP in setting of diuresis
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - switched to neo from midodrine, continue neo as needed, wean as
   tolerated
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using neo as needed
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO Vanc
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -1L
   - per renal, keep SBP >100-110 to prevent any further kidney damage,
   using pressors if necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   - pt will need a tunnel catheter line in place for dialysis in near
   future
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 34u qhs+ISS)
   - blood glucose in 250s, incr glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and new sepsis. The patient's current conditions include sepsis, respiratory failure, hypotension, diarrhea, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, anemia, thrush, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and agitation/anxiety.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are as follows:
1. Sepsis: The patient has elevated white blood cell count, hypothermia, and altered mental status, which are signs of sepsis. The source of infection is likely to be the lines, especially the dialysis catheter.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient has tracheostomy and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and weaning difficulties.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Pressors may be required to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, and Clostridium difficile infection has been suspected. Antibiotic-associated diarrhea should be considered, and appropriate treatment should be initiated.
5. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of chronic renal disease. Ren"

CXR: fluid overloaded, stable
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal
   failure on HD
   .
   # Repiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Unfortunately, diuresis with lasix and HD causes hypotension limiting
   the amount of diuresis we can have. Patient continued on CVVH which is
   less prone to cause hypotension.  Was briefly weaned off ventilator
   yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - continue trials with trach collar
   - continue CVVH for fluid removal, goal is at least -1L  I/Os in lieu
   of 3L positive yesterday
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs concerning the balance between fluids and BP
   - add neo to maintain BP in setting of diuresis
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - resume erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - All abx were d/c-ed on [**10-1**]
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO Vanc
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - continue CVVH for goal I/O of -1L
   - per renal, keep SBP >100-110 to prevent any further kidney damage,
   using pressors if necessary
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   - pt will need a tunnel catheter line in place for dialysis in near
   future
   .
   # Hypotension
  better on CVVH compared to lasix gtt or HD, but still
   intermittently hypotensive
   - continue CVVH
   - switched to neo from midodrine, continue neo as needed, wean as
   tolerated
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using neo as needed
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 34u qhs+ISS)
   - blood glucose in 250s, incr glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - continue with risperidol
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure on hemodialysis. He has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. 

Key findings and assessments include:
- The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, and a C. difficile test was sent, leading to the initiation of oral vancomycin.
- He needs a new line for dialysis in the next few days.
- The patient is currently on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) and neo for blood pressure management.
- His insulin sensitivity has increased, so the dose of glargine was increased from 34 to 38 units at bedtime.
- There is a concern for hemolysis, but haptoglobin levels are elevated, and the peripheral smear is essentially normal.
- The patient has a history of diverticulosis and colon cancer, and there may be potential sources of bleeding such as gastritis or peptic ulcer disease.
- He has thrush and is being treated with nystatin.
- His hyperphosphatemia has resolved, likely secondary to acute renal failure.
- The patient was previously in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is now in sinus rhythm with good rate control.
- He is being managed with risperidone for agitation and anxiety, and ativan may be considered if necessary.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male admit with pancreatitis and now with persistent sepsis and
   renal failure.  He did have brief trial of trach mask with volume
   overload and mental status optimized with pancreatitis largely
   diminished.  He, however, has had return to full mechanical ventilator
   support in the setting of new positive blood cultures.  This has led to
   complication of recurrence of sepsis in the setting of prolonged
   indwelling dialysis catheter.  This represents a substantial worsening
   and secondary insult of blood stream infection wtih resulting
   hypotension and inability to tolerate renal replacement therapy will be
   a significant limitation.
   He has had prolonged illness with initial insult of pancreatitis but
   now with recurrent significant infection
GPC in blood stream
despite
   removal of CVL at earliest possible time but with required ongoing need
   for dialysis cathter.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with A/C support well tolerated--will
   require full support in the setting of ongoing sepsis/hypotension and
   inability to tolerate renal replacment therapy.
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Do have ongoing reasonable pressures with volume delivery and are able
   to support patient.
   -Trach mask trials and weaning not possible at this time.
   2)Hypotension--Secondary to Sepsis--He has worsening hypotension in the
   setting of CVVH, rising WBC count, and now has had evolution of
   signficiant positive blood culture findings with GPC's all concerning
   for catheter related blood stream infection with associated sepsis and
   hypotension through to this morning.
   -Will continue with blood culture surveilllance
   -Will need to expand pressors as have had escalating doses of neo and
   will have to add Levophed at this time.
   -We do have evidence of continued high output stool with concern for C.
   Diff raised and in this setting tube feeds have been poorly tolerated.
   -Will need broad spectrum antibiotics continuing--Vanco po,
   Nystatin/Vanco and add GNR and anerobic coverage
with Cefepime/Cipro
   -Will need to consider sources--pleural fluid, catheters, abdomen,
   gallbladder, sinus, pulmonary, urine source all possible.
   -Will remove dialysis catheter and PICC line
   -Will need to replace with CVL today
   -Will repeat CT scan and Abdominal U/S should there be any change in
   exam or enzymes
   -Will continue to test for C. Diff
   3)Renal Failure-He remains anuric and will need to consider approach to
   renal replacement therapy going forward--we will be limited in terms of
   hemodynamic instability and the current acid/base status and
   electrolyte status does not require it at this time.
   -Will D/C catheter
   -Will replace when needed based on clinical course
   -do not have evidence of severe hyperphosphatemia which would be
   difficult to manage without functioning GI tract.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and sepsis. He was admitted to the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple complications including hypotension secondary to sepsis, persistent large bilateral effusions, and recurrent positive blood cultures despite removal of the central venous line. He also has an ongoing need for dialysis catheter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure - The patient requires full support on the mechanical ventilator due to ongoing sepsis and hypotension. Tracheostomy tube is in place.
2. Hypotension - Secondary to Sepsis - The patient's hypotension is worsening, and he has a rising white blood cell count with significant positive blood culture findings, indicating a catheter-related bloodstream infection with associated sepsis.
3. Renal Failure - The patient remains anuric and will need to consider an approach to renal replacement therapy. There is hemodynamic instability, and the current acid/base status and electrolyte status do not require renal replacement therapy at this time.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a more accurate assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with intially severe pancreatitis, with respiratory
   failure, renal failure and now with  new sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt has elev WBC, is spiking fevers.  Likely [**2-26**] to bactermia
   (gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters).  Source can be lines (most
   likely), lung, c diff, abdominal source, urine, sinusitis, skin,
   gallstones.   D/c'ed dialysis line.  Placed Right subclavian triple
   lumen.  D/c'ed PICC. c. diff neg times 1. Lipase 16. urine culture grew
   out yeasts.
   - continue IV [**Month/Day (2) 339**] for gram positive cocci (day1: [**10-14**]), and cefepime
   (day1: [**10-15**]) and cipro (day1: [**10-15**])
   - continue PO [**Month/Year (2) **] for empiric coverage for c diff
   - f/u on more c diff samples (currently neg x 1)
   - consider adding fluconazole for yeasts in urine
   - f/u TTE
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70%
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - no RRT for now
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue mechanical ventilation, change to PS and monitor ABG
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Hypotension
  on neo and vasopressin and levophed,  CVVH d/c
d on
   [**10-15**]
   - continue neo and vasopressin and levophed
   - maintain MAP>65 and SBP>110 using pressors as needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 11, albumin 1.9 so continues to have a anion
   gap, most likely secondary to renal failure. Delta-delta 1.05, so there
   is no second process contributing to the process.
   - contineu to monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - discontinue CVVH today, remove dialysis catheter today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # GI bleed: most likely [**2-26**] c diff. pt now with guaic positive stools
   and residuals from tube feeds. This AM, stool continued to be guaiac
   positive but NG suction was neg.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x1 since the most recent GIB
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] empiric coverage
   - stop tube feeds for now
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - TF on hold given guaiac positive residual
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - calcium acetate d/c
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - hold risperidol given current AMS
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - order sw c/s

   CXR: persistent bilateral pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with intially severe pancreatitis, with respiratory
   failure, renal failure and now with  new sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt has elev WBC, is spiking fevers.  Likely [**2-26**] to bactermia
   (gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters).  Source can be lines (most
   likely), lung, c diff, abdominal source, urine, sinusitis, skin,
   gallstones.   D/c'ed dialysis line.  Placed Right subclavian triple
   lumen.  D/c'ed PICC. c. diff neg times 1. Lipase 16. urine culture grew
   out yeasts.
   - continue IV [**Month/Day (2) 339**] for gram positive cocci (day1: [**10-14**]), and cefepime
   (day1: [**10-15**]) and cipro (day1: [**10-15**])
   - continue PO [**Month/Year (2) **] for empiric coverage for c diff
   - f/u on more c diff samples (currently neg x 1)
   - order stool studies/cultures to r/o other infections\
   - consider adding fluconazole for yeasts in urine
   - f/u TTE
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70%
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - discontinue CVVH for fluid removal, as pt not tolerating it (low BPs)
   and need to remove dialysis catheter in setting of gram positive cocci
   bacteremia
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue mechanical ventilation, pt did not tolerate attempts to wean
   off of it
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Hypotension
  on neo and vasopressin,  CVVH d/c
d on [**10-15**]
   - continue neo and vasopressin
   - maintain MAP>65 and SBP>110 using pressors as needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 11, albumin 1.9 so continues to have a anion
   gap, most likely secondary to renal failure. Delta-delta 1.05, so there
   is no second process contributing to the process.
   - contineu to monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - discontinue CVVH today, remove dialysis catheter today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # GI bleed: most likely [**2-26**] c diff. pt now with guaic positive stools
   and residuals from tube feeds. This AM, stool continued to be guaiac
   positive but NG suction was neg.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x1 since the most recent GIB
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] empiric coverage
   - stop tube feeds for now
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - TF on hold given guaiac positive residual
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - calcium acetate d/c
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - hold risperidol given current AMS
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - order sw c/s
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: hold tube feeds for now

   Code status: DNR
   Disposition: ICU for now
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now new sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's condition has been unstable with multiple organ dysfunctions, including respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. He has been on mechanical ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, and vasopressor support. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, fever, and positive cultures for gram-positive cocci in blood. Imaging reveals persistent bilateral pleural effusion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. His sputum gram stain shows bacteria, indicating a possible lung infection.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has had multiple lines placed, including a dialysis catheter and a triple-lumen line. There is a risk of infection associated with these lines, especially since the patient has bacteremia.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient has been treated for C. diff and has negative stool cultures. However, he still requires further evaluation and treatment for this infection.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has been deteriorating, leading to the need for continuous renal replacement therapy. The cause of AKI could be due to acute tubular necrosis,"

   CXR: persistent bilateral pleural effusion
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with intially severe pancreatitis, with respiratory
   failure, renal failure and now with  new sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: pt has elev WBC, is hypothermic.  Pt is hypotensive, and
   during rounds, was altered from baseline mental status.  Likely [**2-26**] to
   bactermia (gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters).  Source can be
   lines (most likely), lung, c diff, abdominal source, urine, sinusitis,
   skin, gallstones.
   - continue IV [**Month/Day (2) 339**] for gram positive cocci (will dose PRN to keep
   trough>15)
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] for empiric coverage for c diff
   - f/u on more c diff samples (currently neg x 1)
   - order stool studies/cultures to r/o other infections
   - add on cefepime and cipro to broaden coverage for possible VAP (incl
   double-coverage for pseudomonas)
   - remove current dialysis catheter line (CVVH is stopped for now
   anyway)
   - remove current PICC line
   - place CVL for access
   - f/u Lipase
   - f/u TTE
   .
   # GI bleed: most likely [**2-26**] c diff. pt now with guaic positive stools
   and residuals from tube feeds.
   - f/u c diff studies
   - continue PO [**Month/Day (2) **] empiric coverage
   - stop tube feeds for now
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - discontinue CVVH for fluid removal, as pt not tolerating it (low BPs)
   and need to remove dialysis catheter in setting of gram positive cocci
   bacteremia
   - continue mechanical ventilation, pt did not tolerate attempts to wean
   off of it
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Hypotension
  on neo, had to d/c CVVH today
   - continue neo, consider adding vasopressin if a second pressor is
   needed
   - gave 1L NS bolus this AM to maintain pressures
   - MAP>65 and SBP>110 using pressors as needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 on CVVH. Renal following. Cr is
   improving. DDx include ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He
   has very poor urine output.
   - HD first session [**9-29**], third session on [**10-6**]
   - discontinue CVVH today, remove dialysis catheter today
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend Cr
   - dose meds renally or per CVVH protocol
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue TF at goal rate of 40cc/hr after KUB confirm appropriate
   location of post-pyloric tube and NGT
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable. last PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**] with robust
   response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation in the
   setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - continued calcium acetate as needed
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - hold risperidol given current AMS
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - order sw c/s

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with Pancreatitis now with failure to
   wean from ventilatory support and with clinical course complicated by
   recurrent sepsis with gram positive bacteremia now having catheters
   changed and antibiotics continued in effort to relieve what may be
   catheter related blood stream infection.
   1)Sepsis
   -Vanco po
   -Vanco IV/Cipro/Cefepime
   -Vasopressin/Levophed/Neo
   -Catheters exchanged
   -Will bias towards pressor support rather than fluild bolus given
   volume overload
   2)Respiratory Failure
   -Will continue with pressure support ventilation today
   3)Renal Failure--Urine output is only 22cc in past day suggesting that
   recover of renal function is simply unlikely.
   -Will move to HD if blood pressure improved, will have to consider CVVH
   when respiratory status is obviously impacted upon by volume overload
   or acdemia/uremia/hyperkalemia in evidence.
   4) PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
   CT scan showed inflammation c/w pancreatitis, elevated LFTs with lipase
   up 4K, WBC 19K started on flagyl and levofloxacin
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple health issues including pancreatitis, sepsis, respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient is currently in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and has been experiencing a series of medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Catheter-related bloodstream infection: The patient has recurrent sepsis with gram-positive bacteremia, which may be due to a catheter-related bloodstream infection. Changing catheters and continuing antibiotics are being done to address this issue.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation support. Pressure support ventilation will be continued, and the possibility of tracheostomy tube placement may be considered.

3. Renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, suggesting renal dysfunction. Hemodialysis (HD) may be necessary if blood pressure improves, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) may be required if the respiratory status worsens.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, as indicated by inflammation on CT scan and elevated lipase levels. Antibiotics (flagyl and levofloxacin) have been started.

5. Pain management: The patient has acute and chronic pain, and pain control measures need to be implemented, including the use of morphine.

   Microbiology: Cultures-
   [**10-14**] is last positive culture with GPC's
   Sputum--Klebsiella
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with pancreatitis and now with persistent renal failure,
   respiratory failure and hospital course complicated by gram positive
   bacteremia.  He has had titration of pressors to Levophed/Vasopressin
   and has been able to tolerate wean of mechanical ventilation.  Of
   concern is that patient has had persistence of minimal urine output.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient able to wean down in mechanical
   ventilation to PSV mode at 5/5 with good tolerance
but with mild
   elevation in RR to 24 and Ve=12
   -Continue with PSV today
   2)Sepsis-Improved with catheter change and pressors.  Interestingly
   patient does have yeast in urine and on catheter tip only
   -Cipro(#3)/Cefepime(#4)/Vanco (#4) and po Vanco
   -Levophed off this morning
   -Will have to consider intervention for yeast as is found in two sites
   but patient with substantial clinical improvement
   -Will look to wean vasopressin at this time
   -Will continue Vanco and move to single coverage of gram negative rods
   3)Renal Failure-Do have continued rise in Cr with more than doubling in
   number in 48 hours.  He maintains oliguria and volume overload.  We
   have issues of looking to document clearance of bacteria from blood as
   primary barrier to start of dialysis.  We have rising creatinine and
   rising K+ as concern.
   -Would favor restart of dialysis with CVVH at this time
and would like
   to move to permanent access if possible.
   -Would move to tunneled catheter for access and move to CVVH today.
   4)Pacreatitis-
   -Will return to tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with PSV mode at 5/5. The patient has shown improvement in sepsis with a change in catheter and pressors, but still has a yeast infection in the urine and on the catheter tip. He is also experiencing ongoing renal failure with rising creatinine levels and oliguria. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns regarding his minimal urine output. The plan is to restart dialysis with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and move to permanent access if possible. The patient will also be moved to a tunneled catheter for access and CVVH today. Tube feeds will be re-trialled today. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and although he is tolerating weaning of mechanical ventilation, there is still a mild elevation in respiratory rate. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate respiratory function.

2. Sepsis: The patient has shown improvement with catheter change and pressors, but there is still a yeast infection present. It is important to monitor"

 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The

   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He has several medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Sepsis: The patient has a catheter-related gram-positive bacteremia. His lines and catheters have been changed, and antibiotics have been continued to treat the infection. Other sources of infection include the urine and sputum.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and right-sided thoracentesis. However, his respiratory failure persists, likely due to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. The sputum gram stain shows bacteria, and the patient is currently septic, making ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) also a possibility.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is most likely secondary to renal failure. Monitoring is recommended.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, with creatinine levels increasing. This could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal, or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). Poor urine output is a concern, and the patient may require reinitiation of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH).

   CXR Today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - dc PO [**Known lastname 339**] bc c diff neg x2
   - dc Cef as no pseudomonas so no need for double coverage (there is
   Klebsiella in sputum)
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**]
   - continue cipro (day1: [**10-15**])
   - f/u on more c diff samples (currently neg x 1)
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70%
   - wean pressors today with goal SBP > 90
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - pt able to tolerate [**5-29**];  Continue with PS.
   - monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, treated with cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 16, albumin 2.0 so continues to have a anion
   gap, most likely secondary to renal failure. Delta-delta 1.05, so there
   is no second process contributing to the process.
   - continue  to monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - likely will require reinitiation of CVVH as per renal
   - per renal, request temp HD line today (by IR)
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO [**Month/Day (1) **]
   - restart TF
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - will need dialysis soon.  Followed by renal
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 dropped crit from 29.3 to 25.1.  PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**]
   with robust response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - calcium acetate d/c
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - hold risperidol given current AMS
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - order sw c/s

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been diagnosed with several infections, including yeast in the catheter tip, gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters in blood cultures, and pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum. He also has a history of diarrhea and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload due to acute renal failure and abdominal distention. He has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap, acute on chronic renal failure, and gallstone pancreatitis. The patient's anemia is most likely due to anemia of inflammation. He also has hyperphosphatemia, which has resolved, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic with multiple lines and catheters changed, and antibiotics continued to treat possible catheter-related gram-positive bacteremia.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention.
3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis with an anion gap, likely secondary to renal failure.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with worsening creatinine levels and poor urine output.

   CXR Today
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.  Had increasing
   secretions with increased O2 requirement.
   - increase PEEP and consider switch back to A/C in setting of
   respiratory distress
   - monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, treated with cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - f/u with metabolic acidosis after initiation of CVVH
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - dc PO [**Month/Year (2) 339**] bc c diff neg x2
   - dc Cef as no pseudomonas so no need for double coverage (there is
   Klebsiella in sputum)
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**]
   - continue cipro (day1: [**10-15**])
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70%
   - wean pressors today with goal SBP > 90
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 16, albumin 2.0 so continues to have a anion
   gap, most likely secondary to renal failure. Delta-delta 1.05, so there
   is no second process contributing to the process.
   - continue  to monitor
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - likely will require reinitiation of CVVH as per renal
   - per renal, request temp HD line today (by IR)
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO [**Month/Year (2) **]
   - restart TF
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - pt has diarrhea, WBC bumped up -> sent c diff, started PO [**Name (NI) 339**]
   - pt has bacteremia, started IV [**Name (NI) **], cefepime and cipro
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - will need dialysis soon.  Followed by renal
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 dropped crit from 29.3 to 25.1.  PRBC transfusion on [**10-7**]
   with robust response.  The most likely cause is anemia of inflammation
   in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but haptoglobin
   elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal. Hemorrhagic
   pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on admission
   may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources include
   diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer given h/o
   adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to stomach
   erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Thrush:
   - nystatin swish and swallow
   .
   # Hyperphosphatemia
 Resolved. Most likely secondary to ARF.
   - calcium acetate d/c
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - hold risperidol given current AMS
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - order sw c/s

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. He has a tracheostomy in place. 

The patient has metabolic acidosis with a decreased bicarbonate level and an elevated base deficit. His kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by the elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. He also has hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia. 

The patient's blood cultures have shown growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci and gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, which are resistant to oxacillin. He also has yeast growth in his catheter tip and urine cultures. 

The patient's abdominal distention and pleural effusion may be contributing to his respiratory distress. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation. His blood glucose levels are elevated, and he has a history of type II diabetes mellitus. 

The patient has a history of diverticulosis and colon cancer, and there is a possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding. 

The patient's agitation and anxiety may be related to his acute illness and pain. 

The patient has thrush in his oral cavity and requires treatment with nystatin. 

The patient's AFib with RVR is currently under control, but he should be monitored closely.

   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.  Had increasing
   secretions with increased O2 requirement.
   - increase PEEP and consider switch back to A/C in setting of
   respiratory distress
   - monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, treated with cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - f/u with metabolic acidosis after initiation of CVVH
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - dc PO Vanc bc c diff neg x2
   - dc Cef as no pseudomonas so no need for double coverage (there is
   Klebsiella in sputum)
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**]
   - continue cipro (day1: [**10-15**])
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 16, albumin 2.0 so continues to have a anion
   gap, most likely secondary to renal failure. Delta-delta 1.05, so there
   is no second process contributing to the process.
   - continue  to monitor on CVVH
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - monitor on CVVH

   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - AP bumped up from yesterday; monitor level for now with consideration
   for abdominal U/S if continues to rise

   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS

   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He currently has metabolic acidosis, sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, gallstone pancreatitis, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, diabetes mellitus, anemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and agitation/anxiety. The patient is in the ICU and is on various medications including antibiotics, antifungals, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which increases the risk of developing VAP. The sputum gram stain shows bacteria, indicating a possible infection.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines and catheters, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and dialysis catheter. These can be potential sources of infection, especially since there is evidence of bacteremia.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and his renal function is worsening. Continued monitoring and renal replacement therapy may be necessary to manage this complication.
4. Sepsis: The patient has signs of systemic inflammation and infection, which can lead to sepsis. Aggressive management with appropriate antibiotics and source control is important.
5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial presentation with pancreatitis now with
   prolonged hospital course compliacted by recurrent sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with limited capacity to maintain PSV at
   [**5-29**]--have increased PSV levels to provide better respiratory support
   but that simply will not be enough
Ve requirement is in the range of
   [**1-7**] now
will return to A/C support
   -Will likely move to full A/C support
   -Will need to increase PEEP to 10
   -Trach mask trials simply not reasonable right now
   -Suction PRN
   2)Renal Failure--Patient with persistent and continued increase in Cr
   with oliguria maintained at 400-500cc/d.
   -Dialysis catheter placed
   -Will re-start CVVH with increased K+ and decreased HCO3-
   -Goal for negative fluild balance is unlikley to be realized while
   currently on pressors with CVP <10
   3)Sepsis-Has had some improvement with antibiotic
   -Levophed to wean as possible
   -Cipro/Micafungin/Vanco IV
   -Follow BP and MAP
   -Will need to start midodrine if persistent hypotension seen and
   infection cleared

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. The patient has been in the ICU for an extended period due to recurrent sepsis. The patient requires assistance with ventilation and has limited ability to maintain spontaneous breathing. The patient also has impaired renal function and is oliguric. Antibiotic therapy has shown some improvement in the infection. The patient's blood pressure is currently being managed with norepinephrine, and efforts are being made to wean off it as possible. The patient's nutritional status is being maintained with NovaSource Renal (Full) and regular insulin for glycemic control. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure - The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, and there is a need for full assist-controlled ventilation support. Increasing the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to 10 may be necessary. Tracheostomy mask trials are currently not feasible.
2) Renal Failure - The patient has persistent renal failure with an increasing creatinine level and oliguria. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) will be restarted with increased potassium and decreased bicarbonate levels. It is unlikely to achieve a negative fluid balance while the patient is on pressors with a central venous pressure (CVP) less than 10.
3) Sepsis - Although the patient has shown some improvement with antibiotic therapy, sepsis remains a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum gram stain shows bacteria and pt is currently
   septic, making VAP also a possibility.  Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.  Had increasing
   secretions with increased O2 requirement.
   - currently on AC, RR and PEEP were increased overnight. Stay in the
   current setting for now and monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - no CVVH for now
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc, cefepime in addition to micafungin and
   cipro.
   - c. diff neg x2
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 20 after adjustment for albumin 2.0 so
   continues to have a anion gap, most likely secondary to renal failure.
   Delta-delta 0.9, so there is no complicating non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   - no CVVH for now
   - continue to monitor for renal function and acid-base status, also
   monitor lactate
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - no CVVH for now given hypotension
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - d/c
d erythromycin given diarrhea
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   - AP bumped up from yesterday; monitor level for now with consideration
   for abdominal U/S if continues to rise
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine to 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing metabolic acidosis. He has acute-on-chronic renal failure, and his urine output is very poor. The patient also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and gallstone pancreatitis. His blood cultures have grown yeast and gram-positive bacteria, and he has been treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient's catheter tip grew yeast, which may indicate a potential infection.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is deteriorating, and he is experiencing poor urine output, which can lead to AKI.
4. Sepsis: The patient's blood cultures have grown multiple organisms, indicating a possible sepsis.
5. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance is disturbed, and he has an anion gap metabolic acidosis.
6. Hypotension: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension, which can compromise organ perfusion.
7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a"

 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, RR and PEEP were increased overnight. Stay in the
   current setting for now and monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - continue CVVH while supporting BP with pressor if necessary
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level
   - c. diff neg x2
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 20 after adjustment for albumin 2.0 so
   continues to have a anion gap, most likely secondary to renal failure.
   Delta-delta 0.9, so there is no complicating non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - continue to monitor for renal function and acid-base status, also
   monitor lactate
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - restart erythromycin today
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

   Disposition: ICU for now
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has persistent bilateral pleural effusion and perihilar fullness. He is on assisted ventilation and requires increased RR and PEEP due to volume overload, acute renal failure, and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. Klebsiella was identified in sputum culture, so he is being treated with ciprofloxacin.

2. Sepsis: The patient has multiple sources of infection, including catheter-related yeast infection, urinary tract infection with yeasts, sputum culture positive for pansensitive Klebsiella, and diarrhea. Antibiotics have been changed, and the patient is receiving micafungin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin.

3. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure. CVVH is being continued, and renal function and acid-base status are being monitored.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has worsening creatinine levels, indicating renal dysfunction. The cause is likely a combination of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). CVVH is being continued, and the patient is being followed up by renal specialists.

5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has massive inflammation in the abdomen without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. Post-pyloric feeding has been initiated, and erythromycin has been restarted.

6. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes, and his hyperglycemia is being managed with insulin glargine and intravenous insulin sensitivity syndrome (ISS).

7. Anemia: The patient has stable anemia likely due to anemia of inflammation. Hemolysis is not evident, and the cause may be related to the acute illness.

8. GI Bleed: The patient has a history of guaiac-positive stools indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. C. diff has been ruled out, and the patient's transfusion has been restarted.

9. Hyponatremia and Hyperphosphatemia: The patient has hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia due to acute renal failure and volume overload. CVVH is being performed, and renal function is being monitored.

10. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm with good rate control. This is likely secondary to the fevers, pain, and inflammatory state. Metoprolol has been discontinued, and no anticoagulation is planned at this time.

11. Agitation/Anxiety: The patient is anxious, and consideration is being given to using ativan. A passy-muir valve is being tried today"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis and now with
   persistent respiratory failure, renal failure and course complicated by
   sepsis with GPC's and concern for fungal sepsis raised based upon
   catheter tip findings.  This is of significant concern as we have seen
   rapid increase in WBC count, worsening hypotension and positive
   catheter tip findings.  This clinical decline has been discussed with
   patient and with family and may represent a substantial trend to a
   worse clinical outcome at this time.  Patient did confirm this morning
   that he is comfortable with ongoing treatment at this time and this was
   independent of his family input.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Continue with A/C support
   -Reasonable tolerance of FIO2=0.5
   -Will follow up sputum and has Cipro for Klebsiella PNA
   2)Sepsis-
   -Micafungin
   -Cipro/Vanco (level=26.6)
   -Neoxynephrine
   -This may represent re-emergence of bacterial or fungal sepsis and will
   have to follow culture results going forward.  If we have positive
   blood culture for fungal organisms would certainly have to consider
   futher evaluations and possible move to comfort measures as fungal
   sepsis would likely be a terminal event in this setting.
   3)Renal Failure-
   -CVVH to start today
will have to follow blood pressure and heart
   rhythm during initiation of the CVVH this morning
   -Will return to CVVH today
   -Will need to return to CVVH to improve metabolic acidosis
   4)Pancreatitis-
   -Improved and patient is tolerating tube feeds

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis, and diabetes mellitus type II. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for various medical complications. The patient's current conditions include persistent respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis (bacterial and possible fungal), and acute pancreatitis. He is on mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and receiving multiple medications to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised, and he requires assisted ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may necessitate tracheostomy tube removal or continued ventilatory support.
2. Sepsis: The patient has developed sepsis due to bacterial and possible fungal infections. If the sepsis progresses or if the fungal infection becomes more severe, it could lead to organ dysfunction and potentially be a terminal event.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, and he requires dialysis. There is a risk of worsening renal failure, fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the development of complications associated with dialysis.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).
5. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which can be a side effect"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, RR and PEEP were increased overnight. Stay in the
   current setting for now and monitor gases
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cipro
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - continue CVVH while supporting BP with pressor if necessary
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level
   - c. diff neg x2
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 20 after adjustment for albumin 2.0 so
   continues to have a anion gap, most likely secondary to renal failure.
   Delta-delta 0.9, so there is no complicating non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - continue to monitor for renal function and acid-base status, also
   monitor lactate
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - restart erythromycin today
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been in the ICU since September 28th. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, likely secondary to volume overload caused by acute renal failure and abdominal distention. Sputum cultures have grown Klebsiella, for which the patient is being treated with ciprofloxacin. The patient also has metabolic acidosis, possibly due to renal failure. He is undergoing continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and his renal function is being closely monitored. The patient has gallstone pancreatitis, with ongoing inflammation but no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. He is receiving post-pyloric feedings and erythromycin has been restarted. The patient has type II diabetes mellitus, and his blood sugar levels are being managed with insulin glargine and intravenous insulin. The patient's anemia is likely due to anemia of inflammation. He has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, with positive guaiac stools, but his hematocrit has been stable. The patient is being treated with CVVH for hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia. He had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response but is now in sinus rhythm with good rate control. The patient's agitation and anxiety will be managed with Ativan,"

   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, wean PEEP today
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - continue CVVH while supporting BP with pressor if necessary
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level (today 18.0 so dose today)
   - c. diff neg x2
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Metabolic acidosis
 gap 20 after adjustment for albumin 2.0 so
   continues to have a anion gap, most likely secondary to renal failure.
   Delta-delta 0.9, so there is no complicating non-AG metabolic acidosis.
   - continue CVVH for now
   - continue to monitor for renal function and acid-base status, also
   monitor lactate
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase when are trending down
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of these conditions. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including respiratory failure, sepsis, metabolic acidosis, acute on chronic renal failure, gallstone pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, septic shock, further deterioration of renal function, development of complications from pancreatitis such as pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, progression of anemia, recurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and potential arrhythmias. Close monitoring and prompt management of these conditions will be necessary to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 83-year-old male admitted for gallstone pancreatitis, which has led to multiple complications. These include respiratory failure, renal failure, sepsis secondary to CNS line sepsis and Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and a smoldering fungal infection. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is pressor-dependent. He is also undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for acute renal failure. His pancreatitis appears to be improving, as he is tolerating tube feeds. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should continue to be closely monitored, and adjustments to FiO2 and PEEP may be necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient is still at risk for sepsis due to the ongoing presence of central line and the need for further surveillance cultures. Antibiotic therapy should be continued based on culture sensitivities.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function should be monitored closely, and CVVH should be continued as tolerated.
4. Pancreatitis: Although the patient's pancreatitis appears to be improving, ongoing monitoring and management are necessary.
5. Pain control: The patient's pain should be assessed regularly and managed appropriately.
6. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Nutrition: Ensuring adequate nutrition is essential for the patient's recovery.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated weaning PEEP yesterday, will try PS today
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - continue CVVH while supporting BP with pressor if necessary
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level (was dosed at 3 pm yesterday, f/u on trough at 2
   pm today and redose if needed)
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - continue CVVH
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - tube feeds were [**Last Name (un) **] last night due to high residuals
   - OGT to suction and start tube feeds
   - CT abd/pelvis to look for occult abscess that may have developed
   recently
   - continue erythromycin (consider incr dose per pharm rec)
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase when are trending down
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

   Disposition: ICU for now
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, gallstone pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and agitation/anxiety.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. There is also a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with multiple sources of infection, including the urinary tract, sputum, and catheter-related bloodstream infection. The patient's lines and catheters have been changed, and antibiotics have been continued to treat possible catheter-related bacteremia.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute kidney injury (AKI) on top of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The causes of AKI include acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient is currently undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has acute renal failure. He has metabolic acidosis, gallstone pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, and possible gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has several medical complications that require careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator may be challenging due to underlying COPD and metabolic acidosis.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with multiple sources of infection including lines and catheters, urine, sputum, and stool. Antibiotics have been started to treat the infections.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with poor urine output. Continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) is being performed to support renal function and manage fluid balance.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis likely secondary to renal failure. CVVH will help correct the acid-base imbalance.
5. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with massive inflammation in the abdomen. Monitoring of amylase and lipase levels is important to assess pancreatitis severity.
6. Diabetes Mellitus Type II: The patient"

- The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension.
- The patient was admitted for gallstone pancreatitis and underwent an ERCP and stent procedure. Complications included respiratory failure and renal failure, requiring a tracheostomy and chronic renal replacement.
- The patient became septic with leukocytosis and worsening shock, leading to a diagnosis of CNS line sepsis and Klebsiella ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- There is concern for a smoldering fungal infection due to recovery of non-[Female First Name (un)] species from a recent line, although blood fungal cultures are negative.
- Current medical issues include acute respiratory failure, sepsis, renal failure, and pancreatitis.
- The patient is receiving various treatments including vasopressor infusions, antibiotics for CNS line sepsis, Klebsiella infection, and fungal infection, as well as continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH).
- The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has shown some improvement in pancreatitis.
- The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line, multi-lumen line, and dialysis catheter.

   4. Simple cyst in the right kidney.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate CVVH to this
   point, volume overload likely contributing to poor respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, not on CVVH he is able to be weaned from pressors
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. Blood
   cultures from [**10-16**] have been finalized as negative, per ID will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was 19.6 with last dose on
   [**2153-10-20**], will recheck level in the morning
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - difficuly tolerating  CVVH due to hypotension, ectopy and clotting in
   machine
   - as per renal will hold off in CVVH for now, given his inability to
   tolerate it and he has no urgent indication, will continue to monitor
   and renal is continuing to follow
   - patient remains volume overloaded with very low urine output,
   electrolyte management with CVVH
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. There was initial concern
   for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially
   normal. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive
   stools on admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly
   related to stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB  so PO Vanco was d/c
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, phos has currently normalized and sodium was 134 today
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia of chronic disease, and diverticulosis. He has been experiencing episodes of hypotension, clotting issues with the CVVH machine, and difficulty tolerating it. The patient's recent labs show elevated white blood cell count, elevated lipase levels, and positive cultures for yeast and pansensitive klebsiella. Imaging studies reveal severe pancreatitis with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts, as well as moderate ascites, bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis, and a simple cyst in the right kidney. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 100/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's overall condition is critical, and he remains on various medications and treatments to manage his conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. The presence of bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusion with compressive"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated weaning PEEP yesterday, will try PS today
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol (originally held
   for a fib)
   - f/u with renal recs
   - continue CVVH while supporting BP with pressor if necessary
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has
   downtrending leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. keep
   it on until blood cx are finalized to be negative.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level (was dosed at 3 pm yesterday, f/u on trough at 2
   pm today and redose if needed)
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - difficuly tolerating  CVVH due to hypotension
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - tube feeds were [**Last Name (un) **] last night due to high residuals
   - OGT to suction and start tube feeds
   - CT abd/pelvis to look for occult abscess that may have developed
   recently
   - continue erythromycin (consider incr dose per pharm rec)
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase when are trending down
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

   4. Simple cyst in the right kidney.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently extremely volume overloaded with almost no urine
   output, on 93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate
   CVVH to this point, volume overload likely contributing to poor
   respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, not on CVVH he is able to be weaned from pressors
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. Blood
   cultures from [**10-16**] have been finalized as negative, will .
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cipro (day1:
   [**10-15**]). Also continue vanc in addition to micafungin and cipro.
   - dose vanc by level (was dosed at 3 pm yesterday, f/u on trough at 2
   pm today and redose if needed)
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - difficuly tolerating  CVVH due to hypotension
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - tube feeds were [**Last Name (un) **] last night due to high residuals
   - OGT to suction and start tube feeds
   - CT abd/pelvis to look for occult abscess that may have developed
   recently
   - continue erythromycin (consider incr dose per pharm rec)
   - continue to trend LFTs, amylase and lipase when are trending down
   - check bladder pressures if clinically shows worsening abdominal
   distention.
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. Concern for hemolysis but
   haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially normal.
   Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive stools on
   admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible sources
   include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon cancer
   given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly related to
   stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB -> d/c PO vanc
   - restart TF
   .
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 currently in sinus with good rate control.  Most
   likely secondary to the fevers, pain and inflammatory state.
   - dilt discontinued.  Metoprolol 25mg TID dc/ed in setting of
   hypotension.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - try passy-muir today
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure and has been experiencing episodes of hypotension and clotting issues with the CVVH machine. The patient has been titrated down on Neo for blood pressure support and is tolerating it well. RSBI is in the 50s, and the plan is to attempt a trial of pressure support. The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics for various infections, including cefepime for a Klebsiella infection in the sputum, micafungin for yeast in the catheter tip culture, and vancomycin for possible catheter-related bacteremia. 

The patient's abdominal CT shows severe pancreatitis, moderate ascites, bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis, and a simple cyst in the right kidney. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, but there is evidence of infection in the urine and stool. 

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload, likely secondary to acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. The patient has been weaned off the ventilator briefly but required reintubation due to dyspnea. 

The patient's renal function is poor, with very poor urine output and difficulty tolerating CVVH due to hypotension. 

The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, with an"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple ongoing medical issues. 

The patient is experiencing severe pancreatitis, as indicated by the CT abdomen results. There is also moderate ascites, bilateral moderate-sized pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis, and a simple cyst in the right kidney. These findings suggest potential complications related to the pancreatitis, such as pleural effusion and atelectasis due to inflammation and fluid accumulation.

The patient is also on continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) for renal support, which has been stopped temporarily due to clotting issues with the machine. This indicates that the patient may have acute kidney injury or severe renal dysfunction requiring dialysis.

The patient's respiratory status is being closely monitored with the assistance of a ventilator. The RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) is in the 50s, indicating the possibility of weaning from mechanical ventilation. However, the presence of bilateral pleural effusions may pose a challenge in this process.

In terms of infections, the patient is receiving multiple antibiotics including cefepime, vancomycin, and micafungin. There is also a concern for Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff) given the recent stool toxin test. Imaging of the abdomen is recommended to evaluate for any pancreatic fluid collection or abscess.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's current condition include worsening respiratory distress due to pleural effusions,"

   4. Right renal cyst.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate CVVH to this
   point, volume overload likely contributing to poor respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now on vasopressin for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, BP
s better off HD
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was 17.3, will need additional
   doses of vancomycin and cefepime post HD
   - ID still requesting [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] discuss how it will change our
   management since that will likely mean removal of post-pyloric feeding
   tube, additionally patient has remained afebrile, and blood cx
s have
   cleared since initial positive cultures
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor to almost no urine output.
   - patient tried on HD today with pressors to help support his BP, renal
   optimistic that they will find a way for him to tolerate HD
   - renal concerned that he should have a line holiday, since maybe we
   have just been unable to get the fungal cultures at the right time,
   will hold off for now since re-siting all of his lines will be
   problem[**Name (NI) 595**] since that has already been done during his course
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, currently with good BS control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 bleeding from A line overnight, with drop in HCT to 19.3,
   patient transfused 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - cont IV PPI
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, have resolved
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He currently has metabolic acidosis, volume overload, and is on mechanical ventilation. His sputum culture grew Klebsiella, and he is being treated with cefepime. The patient's blood culture showed yeast, and he is being treated with micafungin. He has a history of diarrhea and is experiencing agitation and anxiety. The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. His imaging results indicate severe pancreatitis with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. The patient's goals of care include daily updates for the family and continuing with the current treatment plan.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning due to the rapid re-accumulation of pleural effusion and difficulty weaning off the ventilator. There is a need to address underlying COPD and manage volume overload.

2. Sepsis: The patient has shown improvement after changing lines and catheters, but ongoing monitoring and treatment are required. Antibiotics should be continued, and fungal infection should be addressed.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, with poor urine output and increasing creatinine levels. Hemodialysis may be necessary, and careful electrolyte management is needed.

   4. Right renal cyst.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate CVVH to this
   point, volume overload likely contributing to poor respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, not on CVVH he is able to be weaned from pressors
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. Blood
   cultures from [**10-16**] have been finalized as negative, per ID will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was 19.6 with last dose on
   [**2153-10-20**], will recheck level in the morning
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - difficuly tolerating  CVVH due to hypotension, ectopy and clotting in
   machine
   - as per renal will hold off in CVVH for now, given his inability to
   tolerate it and he has no urgent indication, will continue to monitor
   and renal is continuing to follow
   - patient remains volume overloaded with very low urine output,
   electrolyte management with CVVH
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. There was initial concern
   for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially
   normal. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive
   stools on admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly
   related to stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB  so PO Vanco was d/c
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, phos has currently normalized and sodium was 134 today
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He currently has metabolic acidosis and is experiencing volume overload, which is contributing to his poor respiratory status. The patient's pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated after thoracentesis, and he has been unable to tolerate continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) due to low blood pressure.

The patient's sputum culture grew Klebsiella, and he is being treated with cefepime as per Infectious Disease recommendations. The patient also has a catheter-related yeast infection, presumptively not Candida albicans, and is being treated with micafungin. The patient's underlying COPD should be managed with MDIs including albuterol.

The patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is likely due to a combination of factors including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pre-renal azotemia, and allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient has poor urine output, and efforts are being made to optimize renal function. The patient may require dialysis to manage his renal failure.

The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with severe inflammation but no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. His post-pyloric feeding tube is in place, and he is tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin.

The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus,"

   4. Right renal cyst.
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate CVVH to this
   point, volume overload likely contributing to poor respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - continues on neo for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, not on CVVH he is able to be weaned from pressors
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx. Blood
   cultures from [**10-16**] have been finalized as negative, per ID will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was 19.6 with last dose on
   [**2153-10-20**], will recheck level in the morning
   - follow lactate
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening.
   Diff includes ATN, pre-renal and AIN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very
   poor urine output.
   - difficuly tolerating  CVVH due to hypotension, ectopy and clotting in
   machine
   - as per renal will hold off in CVVH for now, given his inability to
   tolerate it and he has no urgent indication, will continue to monitor
   and renal is continuing to follow
   - patient remains volume overloaded with very low urine output,
   electrolyte management with CVVH
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM. Other causes for hyperglycemia include
   pancreatitis and stress response in the setting of sepsis and acute
   illness.  Discontinued insulin gtt and started insulin ss on [**10-2**] (fixed
   glargine 38u qhs+ISS)
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 Stable around hct of 26.  The most likely cause is anemia of
   inflammation in the setting of acute disease. There was initial concern
   for hemolysis but haptoglobin elevated and peripheral smear essentially
   normal. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis not seen on CT abd. Heme positive
   stools on admission
 may be due to gastritis, PUD. Other possible
   sources include diverticular bleed given known diverticulosis or colon
   cancer given h/o adenomas. No history of varices.  Also possibly
   related to stomach erosions seen on ERCP from OG trauma.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - c.diff neg x2 since the most recent GIB  so PO Vanco was d/c
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, phos has currently normalized and sodium was 134 today
   - on CVVH. followed by renal
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   - no anticoagulation for now given only one episode in the setting of
   acute illness
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has had several medical complications, including respiratory failure due to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. He also has metabolic acidosis, which makes it difficult to wean him off the ventilator. The patient has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and has been on post-pyloric feeding tube since September 27th. His blood cultures have shown growth of yeast and Gram-negative rods, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, for which he is receiving appropriate antibiotics. The patient has been on CVVH but has had difficulty tolerating it due to hypotension, ectopy, and clotting in the machine. His renal function is worsening, and he has very poor urine output. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.5, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.1 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion.  Sputum cx grew klebsiella. Also has metabolic acidosis
   making it difficult to go off ventilator. Was briefly weaned off
   ventilator yesterday, but back on bc dyspneic.
   - currently on AC, tolerated PS yesterday, and periods of time with PMV
   as well, patient has been getting subjectively short of breath with PMV
   in place, however he was able to maintain his oxygen saturation without
   any increase in RR
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, and he has been unable to tolerate CVVH to this
   point, volume overload likely contributing to poor respiratory status
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia, gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib/RVR). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure-controlled ventilation mode (PCV/SBT). He is receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, micafungin, cefepime, vancomycin, and erythromycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 146/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 28.5 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels, and positive cultures for klebsiella, yeast, and GNR. Imaging studies reveal severe pancreatitis with no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload, acute renal failure, abdominal distention, and underlying COPD. There is a concern for recurrent pleural effusion and difficulty weaning off the"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 currently s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and right
   sided thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in
   right lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The
   respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung
   expansion, additionally the pneumonia with sputum cx that grew
   klebsiella.
   - pt. tolerated two SBT
s for 30 minutes yesterday, will continue SBT
   trials today to build up strength in respiratory muscles
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, tolerated HD on pressors but was 1L positive
   with HD
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now on vasopressin for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, BP
s better off HD
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course, today is day #7.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was around 15, will dose
   another 500mg this morning, will need additional doses of vancomycin
   and cefepime post HD
   - will hold off on TEE for now, since it will not immediately change
   our management
   - follow lactate, had trended down post HD
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening,
   likely due to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very poor to almost no
   urine output.
   - patient tolerated HD with pressors, next HD session per renal
   scheduled for Thursday or [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch base about possible change
   to CVVH to help mobilize more fluid.
   - will discuss change to vasopressin during HD as renal is concerned
   that he has a lack of endogenous vasopressin
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place, will discuss pulling the tube this evening
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, currently with good BS control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 bleeding from A line overnight, with drop in HCT to 19.3,
   patient transfused 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload, pneumonia with sputum culture growing Klebsiella, and underlying COPD. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has undergone tracheostomy.

The patient's renal failure is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and the patient has poor urine output. The patient is planned for dialysis on Thursday or Friday, and there is a discussion about changing to continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) to mobilize more fluid.

The patient has severe gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. The patient is tolerating post-pyloric tube feeds and erythromycin is being used.

The patient has type II diabetes mellitus with good blood sugar control and is on glargine insulin subcutaneously at night.

The patient has anemia, which may be due to bleeding from an arterial line. The patient has been transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding with positive guaiac test in stools. Prophylactic IV PPI is being continued.

The patient had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which has resolved, and the patient remains in sinus rhythm with good rate control.

   BP improving off of dialysis. Continue to monitor.  Electrolytes
   acceptable today; acid-base status okay. If BP stable today, may
   consider trying CVVH tomorrow; remains unclear if his hypotension is
   due to reaction to the filter. Patient remains significantly volume
   overloaded, which is an impediment, to some degree to weaning off
   ventilator (weight of chest wall) and ambulation. Blood cultures remain
   negative. If unable to wean off phenylephrine, would consider starting
   vasopressin.
   Continues on antibiotics. WBC remains elevated.
   Hct stable. No evidence of active bleeding. Had good response to
   transfusion yesterday.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion,
   additionally the pneumonia with sputum cx that grew klebsiella.
   - pt. tolerated two SBT
s for 30 minutes yesterday, will continue SBT
   trials today to build up strength in respiratory muscles
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, tolerated HD on pressors but was 1L positive
   with HD
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now on vasopressin for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, BP
s better off HD
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course, today is day #7.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was around 15, will dose
   another 500mg this morning, will need additional doses of vancomycin
   and cefepime post HD
   - will hold off on TEE for now, since it will not immediately change
   our management
   - follow lactate, had trended down post HD
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening,
   likely due to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very poor to almost no
   urine output.
   - patient tolerated HD with pressors, next HD session per renal
   scheduled for Thursday or [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch base about possible change
   to CVVH to help mobilize more fluid.
   - will discuss change to vasopressin during HD as renal is concerned
   that he has a lack of endogenous vasopressin
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place, will discuss pulling the tube this evening
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion,
   additionally the pneumonia with sputum cx that grew klebsiella.
   - pt. tolerated two SBT
s for 30 minutes yesterday, will continue SBT
   trials today to build up strength in respiratory muscles
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, tolerated HD on pressors but was 1L positive
   with HD
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now on vasopressin for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, BP
s better off HD
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course, today is day #7.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was around 15, will dose
   another 500mg this morning, will need additional doses of vancomycin
   and cefepime post HD
   - will hold off on TEE for now, since it will not immediately change
   our management
   - follow lactate, had trended down post HD
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening,
   likely due to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very poor to almost no
   urine output.
   - patient tolerated HD with pressors, next HD session per renal
   scheduled for Thursday or [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch base about possible change
   to CVVH to help mobilize more fluid.
   - will discuss change to vasopressin during HD as renal is concerned
   that he has a lack of endogenous vasopressin
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place, will discuss pulling the tube this evening
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, currently with good BS control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 bleeding from A line overnight, with drop in HCT to 19.3,
   patient transfused 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - cont IV PPI
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, have resolved
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple medical complications including pneumonia, catheter-related bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and gastrointestinal bleeding. He is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperphosphatemia, anemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to volume overload, acute renal failure, abdominal distention impeding lung expansion, and pneumonia with sputum culture growing Klebsiella.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis with multiple sources of infection including catheter-related bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with worsening creatinine levels, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). He has very poor to almost no urine output.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding with guaiac positive stools. There is ongoing monitoring and management of this condition.
5. Anemia: The patient has anemia due to bleeding from an arterial line and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been transfused with 1 unit of packed red blood cells.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion,
   additionally the pneumonia with sputum cx that grew klebsiella.
   - pt. tolerated two SBT
s for 30 minutes yesterday, will continue SBT
   trials today to build up strength in respiratory muscles
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost no urine output, only
   93cc in past 24 hours, tolerated HD on pressors but was 1L positive
   with HD
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing [**Month/Year (2) 1564**], presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now on vasopressin for BP support, will continue to down titrate and
   BP
s will allow, BP
s better off HD
   - as per ID rec, started micafungin for [**Month/Year (2) 1564**] in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course, today is day #7.
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was around 15, will dose
   another 500mg this morning, will need additional doses of vancomycin
   and cefepime post HD
   - will hold off on TEE for now, since it will not immediately change
   our management
   - follow lactate, had trended down post HD
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat worsening,
   likely due to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has very poor to almost no
   urine output.
   - patient tolerated HD with pressors, next HD session per renal
   scheduled for Thursday or [**Last Name (LF) 511**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] touch base about possible change
   to CVVH to help mobilize more fluid.
   - will discuss change to vasopressin during HD as renal is concerned
   that he has a lack of endogenous vasopressin
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - OGT still in place, will discuss pulling the tube this evening
   - CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged pancreatitis
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, currently with good BS control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
 bleeding from A line overnight, with drop in HCT to 19.3,
   patient transfused 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - cont IV PPI
   ..
   # hyponatremia and hyperphosphatemia: in the setting of ARF and volume
   overload, have resolved
   - electrolyte management with HD
   .
   # Afib with RVR
 has resolved and he remains in sinus with good rate
   control.  Prior episode was most likely secondary to the fever, pain
   and inflammatory state.
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to volume overload, acute renal failure, and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. He also has pneumonia with sputum culture showing Klebsiella. The patient has been treated with cefepime, lasix, and vasopressin for sepsis. His renal failure is likely secondary to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has gallstone pancreatitis with severe inflammation in the abdomen, but no evidence of pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. He has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and is currently well-controlled on glargine. The patient also has anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and agitation/anxiety. The goals of care include daily updates for the family and continued ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of renal failure, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and complications related to the patient's diabetes and anemia."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]). Pleural effusion rapidly re-accumulated in right
   lung after throacentesis, the effect was not durable.  The respiratory
   failure is likely secondary to volume overload in the setting of acute
   renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion,
   additionally the pneumonia with sputum cx that grew klebsiella.
   - pt. tolerated two SBT
s for 30 minutes yesterday, but did not
   tolerate SBT this AM w ABG showing pH 7.
 will try SBT again this
   afternoon
   - sputum cultures => klebsiella, on cefepime per ID
   - sputum gram stain from [**10-20**] also shows GNR
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - patient currently volume overloaded with almost little urine output
   - given lasix 80mg IV and didn
t put out much urine, so may give a dose
   of 160mg IV lasix later this afternoon
   .
   # Sepsis: had lines and catheters changed and antibiotics continued in
   effort to treat possible catheter related gram positive bacteremia.
   Cath tip growing yeast, presumptively not c. albicans.  Pt has slight
   improvement in leukocytosis, afebrile overnight.  Other sources include
   urine, which grew yeasts, sputum which grew pansensitive klebsiella,
   and stool as pt had history of diarrhea.
   - now transitioning to vasopressin for BP support, will continue to
   wean down phenylephrine
   - as per ID rec, getting micafungin for yeast in catheter tip cx, will
   complete a [**8-3**] day course
has had 7 days
   - pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum from [**10-13**], continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - dose vanc by level, level this morning was 18.2, will dose another
   500mg this morning, will need additional doses of vancomycin and
   cefepime post HD
   - follow lactate, had trended down post HD
   - maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if needed
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure Renal following. Creat relatively
   stable, not improving, likely due to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  He has
   very poor to almost no urine output.
   - patient tolerated HD with pressors, next HD session per renal
   scheduled for Friday, which may be tolerated better when on vasopressin
   -  may not need HD if lasix drip continues to output good urine amount
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 repeat CT abd without IV contrast unchanged,
   still has massive inflammation in the abdomen, no evidence of
   pancreatic necrosis or presence of pseudocysts. Has had post-pyloric
   feeding tube in place since [**9-27**].  CT abd/pelvis with severe unchanged
   pancreatitis
   - patient currently tolerating tube feeds with erythromycin
   - will get PEG tube tomorrow by IP
   - continue erythromycin
   - continue to trend LFTs, lipase as normalized
   - check ionized calcium daily
 replete as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, currently with good BS control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
  Hct stable.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   .
   # GI bleed: history of guiac positive stools.  Hct has been stable.
   - cont IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has undergone several interventions including tracheostomy, right-sided thoracentesis, placement of a post-pyloric feeding tube, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion. The patient's current condition includes volume overload, pneumonia with sputum culture growing klebsiella, and positive yeast growth in catheter tip culture. He is also experiencing acute on chronic renal failure with poor urine output and has a history of gallstone pancreatitis without evidence of pancreatic necrosis or pseudocysts. Other medical conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving appropriate antibiotics, antifungals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis may worsen if there is no improvement in response to antibiotic therapy or if new sources of infection are identified.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may persist if there is continued volume overload, pneumonia, or inability to tolerate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure may not improve if there is no response to dialysis or if the underlying cause of acute renal injury is not addressed.
4. Pneumonia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.   Currently on pressure
   support, tolerating well.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - pt did not tolerate SBT w trach shield yesterday but will try
   Passy-Muir Valve w pressure support today
   - Continue on Cefepime, Day 8, as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today but careful not
   to diurese more than 2L per day
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia.  Previously had lines and
   catheters changed and antibiotics continued in effort to treat possible
   catheter related gram positive bacteremia.  Cath tip growing yeast,
   presumptively not c. albicans.   Urine has also grown yeast, sputum
   grew pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - continue transitioning to vasopressin for BP support, will continue
   to wean down phenylephrine
   - as per ID recs, will DC micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day 14)
   after today
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - Continue to maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if
   needed as per Early Goal Directed Therapy protocol
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt was supposed to get Hemodialysis today but
   will not, per Renal recs, because he is responding very well to the
   lasix drip, making good urine output. Renal failure presumed to be due
   to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  Creatinine increasing, but cannot consider
   previous Cr values accurate while on CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular
   function is not likely worsening
likely improving due to improved
   ability to produce urine.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os -1 L per day (no more than
   2L because he may not be able to mobilize extra third-spaced body
   fluids that quickly into intravascular space)
   -  may not need HD in future if lasix drip continues to output good
   urine amount
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - can be fed through new PEG tube this afternoon
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   - no need to trend LFTs regularly
   - replete calcium as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, had a couple of low blood sugars last night
   while NPO and got
 dose insulin.  Pt will restart tube feed through
   PEG tube today, so sugars should not become low.
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
  Hct stable.  Hx of GI bleed.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in [**1-26**] weeks
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. 

The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to Klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion. 

The patient has sepsis caused by coagulation-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia. Previous lines and catheters have been changed, and antibiotics have been continued in an effort to treat possible catheter-related Gram-positive bacteremia. The catheter tip is growing yeast, presumptively not Candida albicans. The urine has also grown yeast, and the sputum grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella. 

The patient continues to be on pressors for blood pressure support and is being weaned down from phenylephrine. Micafungin and vancomycin will be discontinued as per ID recommendations. 

The patient has acute kidney injury (ATN) due to pancreatitis, but renal function is improving due to good urine output from the lasix drip. Hemodialysis may not be necessary if the lasix drip continues to provide good urine output. 

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis is clinically improving, and he can start receiving feeds through the new PEG tube.

   =======================
   Patient had difficulty on trach mask yesterday; in priori days, he was
   getting periods on CPAP of 5 (not trach mask). Thus, we are not as far
   along with weaning from the ventilator as we had initially thought. We
   have started to diruese him with lasix to reduce gross total body
   volume overload; weight of chest wall is a contributing factor to his
   ongoing respiratory failure.
   Has not had dialysis for three days. Creat is rising slowly but the
   response to lasix and the relatively slow rate of increase in
   creatinine is encouraging. CVP about [**1-6**] now with PEEP 5. Dose of
   phenylephrine is coming down. Remains on vasopressin.
   Hct stable. No evidence of bleeding. Not at transfusion threshold.
   Completing course of antibiotics.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for ongoing respiratory failure as evidenced by the difficulty in weaning off the ventilator and the need for tracheostomy.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient has a rising creatinine level and a baseline BUN/creatinine of 26-27/1.4-1.5. This indicates a decline in kidney function, which can progress to acute renal failure if not managed appropriately.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has evidence of acute pancreatitis, as indicated by elevated lipase levels and inflammation seen on a CT scan. Pancreatitis can lead to complications such as necrosis or abscess formation if not treated promptly.

4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level suggests anemia, which may be due to chronic disease, blood loss, or other underlying causes. Anemia can contribute to poor oxygen delivery to tissues and may require treatment with blood transfusions or erythropoietin.

5. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with severe sepsis with organ dysfunction. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation. It can lead to organ failure if not promptly recognized and treated.

6. Fever of unknown origin (FU"

   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.   Currently on pressure
   support, tolerating well.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and add inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs even for today, careful not
   to diurese more than 2L per day
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia.  Previously had lines and
   catheters changed and antibiotics continued in effort to treat possible
   catheter related gram positive bacteremia.  Cath tip growing yeast,
   presumptively not c. albicans.   Urine has also grown yeast, sputum
   grew pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation, will add inhaled
   tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated,
   will likely need to back down on diuresis as his CVP=7 currently and is
   still on pressors, so he is third spacing a large amount of fluid but
   intra-vascularly likely volume down
   - as per ID recs, will DC micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day
   14)after  today
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  with an average of
   80-100cc/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN. Urine eos neg
   x2.  Creatinine increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values
   accurate while on CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not
   likely worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce
   urine.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of even today (no more
   than 2L because he may not be able to mobilize extra third-spaced body
   fluids that quickly into intravascular space)
   -  may not need HD in future if lasix drip continues to output good
   urine amount
   - renal continuing to follow
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - feeds through PEG tube
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   - no need to trend LFTs regularly
   - replete calcium as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, had a couple of low blood sugars last night
   while NPO and got
 dose insulin.  Pt will restart tube feed through
   PEG tube today, so sugars should not become low.
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  HCT=20.9 today, down from 22, will send
   type and screen and plan to transfuse 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in [**1-26**] weeks
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He is currently on mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, and has had several lines and catheters placed. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors, including a new infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure. He also has a coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia, likely related to a catheter. The patient's renal function is improving, but he still requires dialysis. He also has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and agitation/anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently on pressure support and tolerating well. However, the new pseudomonas infection may further worsen his respiratory status.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. Despite changing lines and antibiotics, the infection persists, and there is a risk of continued systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has acute renal failure, which is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His renal function is slowly improving, but he still requires dialysis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on a lasix drip, pressure support, and vasopressin. The patient's recent sputum culture showed pansensitive klebsiella, so the antibiotic regimen will be changed to zosyn based on sensitivities. The patient's underlying COPD will be treated with MDIs including albuterol. The patient's sepsis is due to coag-negative staph bacteremia, and the catheter tip grew yeast. The patient's urine and sputum also grew yeast. The patient's acute renal failure is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and his ability to produce urine has improved with the lasix drip. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis appears to be improving, and he is being fed through a PEG tube. The patient has type II diabetes and had low blood sugars while NPO, so he will restart tube feeds today. The patient has a history of GI bleed and is being monitored for anemia. The patient is also experiencing agitation/anxiety and is being started on citalopram for depression. The goals of care include updating the family daily, providing ICU care, and managing nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis. The patient's disposition is ICU.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.   Currently on pressure
   support, tolerating well.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - pt tolerated PMV  in the past, but had difficulty yesterday  with
   decreases in O2 sats to 70% possibly related to new pseudomonas in his
   sputum
   - Change to zosyn based on recent pseudomonas in sputum, will f/u with
   ID about course
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today but careful not
   to diurese more than 2L per day
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia.  Previously had lines and
   catheters changed and antibiotics continued in effort to treat possible
   catheter related gram positive bacteremia.  Cath tip growing yeast,
   presumptively not c. albicans.   Urine has also grown yeast, sputum
   grew pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation, will change antibiotics
   to zosyn based on sensitivities and follow up with ID
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   - as per ID recs, will DC micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day 14)
   today
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  with an average of
   80-100cc/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN. Urine eos neg
   x2.  Creatinine increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values
   accurate while on CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not
   likely worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce
   urine.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os -1 L per day (no more than
   2L because he may not be able to mobilize extra third-spaced body
   fluids that quickly into intravascular space)
   -  may not need HD in future if lasix drip continues to output good
   urine amount
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - feeds through PEG tube
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   - no need to trend LFTs regularly
   - replete calcium as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, had a couple of low blood sugars last night
   while NPO and got
 dose insulin.  Pt will restart tube feed through
   PEG tube today, so sugars should not become low.
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  HCT=20.9 today, down from 22, will send
   type and screen and plan to transfuse 1unit PRBC
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in [**1-26**] weeks
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis.
- He has a history of COPD and type II diabetes.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support due to respiratory failure caused by klebsiella pneumonia.
- He is also experiencing sepsis with coag-negative staph bacteremia and has a fungal infection in his urine and sputum.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and his kidneys are being supported with a lasix drip.
- His gallstone pancreatitis appears to be improving, and he is being fed through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.
- The patient's blood sugar levels were low last night, so he will restart tube feeds today.
- He has anemia due to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is scheduled for a blood transfusion.
- The patient is experiencing agitation and anxiety but is able to communicate with his family.
- His goals of care include daily updates to the family.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a recurrence of pneumonia or if the current infection does not respond to antibiotics.
2. Sepsis: The patient's"

   catheters changed and antibiotics continued in effort to treat possible
   catheter related gram positive bacteremia.  Cath tip growing yeast,
   presumptively not c. albicans.   Urine has also grown yeast, sputum
   grew pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - continue transitioning to vasopressin for BP support, will continue
   to wean down phenylephrine
   - as per ID recs, will DC micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day 14)
   after today
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, continue cefepime for
   additional GNR coverage.
   - Continue to maintain goal MAP>65, CVP>10, ScvO2>70% with pressors if
   needed as per Early Goal Directed Therapy protocol
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt was supposed to get Hemodialysis today but
   will not, per Renal recs, because he is responding very well to the
   lasix drip, making good urine output. Renal failure presumed to be due
   to ATN. Urine eos neg x2.  Creatinine increasing, but cannot consider
   previous Cr values accurate while on CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular
   function is not likely worsening
likely improving due to improved
   ability to produce urine.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os -1 L per day (no more than
   2L because he may not be able to mobilize extra third-spaced body
   fluids that quickly into intravascular space)
   -  may not need HD in future if lasix drip continues to output good
   urine amount
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - can be fed through new PEG tube this afternoon
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   - no need to trend LFTs regularly
   - replete calcium as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, had a couple of low blood sugars last night
   while NPO and got
 dose insulin.  Pt will restart tube feed through
   PEG tube today, so sugars should not become low.
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
  Hct stable.  Hx of GI bleed.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in [**1-26**] weeks
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and now sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple factors, including klebsiella pneumonia, volume overload, acute renal failure, and abdominal distention. He is also experiencing sepsis due to coagulation-negative staphylococcal bacteremia. The patient has had several lines and catheters changed, and antibiotics have been continued to treat possible catheter-related gram-positive bacteremia. The patient's current treatment plan includes continuing on cefepime, transitioning to vasopressin for blood pressure support, weaning down phenylephrine, discontinuing micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day 14), and maintaining goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) >65, central venous pressure (CVP) >10, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) >70%. The patient's renal failure is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and is being managed with a lasix drip. The patient's gallstone pancreatitis appears to be improving, and he will be fed through a new percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus and is being managed with glargine insulin. He also has"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and renal failure. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged period and is currently on multiple medications, including vasopressin, furosemide, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 122/45 mmHg and a heart rate of 85 bpm. However, the patient is unable to stand and has impaired motor function. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, creatinine, and lactate, as well as low levels of albumin and potassium.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient already has persistent respiratory failure, which may lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by the elevated BUN/creatinine levels. This could worsen if not properly managed, leading to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for dialysis.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may continue to progress, leading to complications such as abscess formation, necrosis, or systemic inflammation.
4. Ineffective Coping: The patient's ineffective coping mechanisms may contribute to the overall severity of his condition and prolongation of his ICU stay.

   SPUTUM-[**10-20**]
Moderate growth of Pseudomona and Klebsiella
   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis and now with
   prolonged ICU course complicated by persistent respiratory failure and
   renal failure.  He does have rising Cr in the setting of CVVH hold and
   ongoing diuresis.  Importantly he does have decrease in WBC count
   through to today.
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient with good tolerance of PSV support
he has
   maintained resonable respiratory rate and tidal volume and ongoing
   treatment for pneumonia is in place and will continue diuresis.
   -Will continue to treat with Cefepime and inhaled Tobramycine
   -Will continue to move to trach mask trials
   -Continued pressor requirement in addition would suggest treatment of
   pseudomonas is reasonable.
   2)Renal Failure-
   -Diruesis as tolerated
   -He does have CVP of 7 and has been able to tolerate PSV of [**5-29**] and has
   required Vasopressin ongoing
   -Will need to move to goal of even fluid balance today given concern
   for new infection, decrease in CVP and rise in creatinine
   -Will transfuse 1 unit PRBC
   3)Pancreatitis-
   -Tube feeds
   4)Anemia-
   -Transfuse one unit today
   Additional issues to be addressed in the housestaff note of this date

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure and
   abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.   Currently on pressure
   support, tolerating well.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and add inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs even for today, prefer not to
   diurese more than 1.5L per day
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia.  Previously had lines and
   catheters changed and antibiotics continued in effort to treat possible
   catheter related gram positive bacteremia.  Cath tip growing yeast,
   presumptively not c. albicans.   Urine has also grown yeast, sputum
   grew pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation, will add inhaled
   tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated,
   will likely need to back down on diuresis as his CVP=7 currently and is
   still on pressors, so he is third spacing a large amount of fluid but
   intra-vascularly likely volume down
   - as per ID recs, will DC micafungin (day 10) and vancomycin (day
   14)after  today
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  with an average of
   100cc/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of even today (no more
   than 2L because he may not be able to mobilize extra third-spaced body
   fluids that quickly into intravascular space)
   - may need to decrease lasix gtt today because CVP has been low, and pt
   should have enough fluids to be on pressors
   - renal continuing to follow
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - feeds through PEG tube
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   - no need to trend LFTs regularly
   - replete calcium as necessary
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety: patient tolerated PMV well, and has been able to
   communicate with family.  Was started on citalopram 10mg this week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in [**1-26**] weeks
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

   pressor requirement
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 122/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has multiple comorbidities including COPD, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and gallstone pancreatitis. He is currently receiving multiple medications including vasopressin, furosemide, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and cefepime.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently on pressure support and tolerating well. However, new pseudomonas in his sputum may contribute to his respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus bacteremia. He has had lines and catheters changed, and antibiotics have been continued to treat possible catheter-related gram-positive bacteremia. Yeast has also grown from the urine and sputum cultures"

   Assessment and Plan
    Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, renal
   failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Currently on pressure support, not tolerating [**5-29**] as well, on [**10-29**]
   currently.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, careful not to
   diurese more than 2L per day
   - if pt can tolerate, try Spont breathing trial today
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  over 100cc/hr on lasix gtt
   15mg/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of -1L ; may need to
   decrease lasix gtt to be able to wean off vasopressin
   - renal continuing to follow
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving
   - feeds through [**Month/Day (4) **] tube without problems
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in 1 wk
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

   Disposition: ICU, hopeful pulmonary rehab when he no longer has a
   pressor requirement
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been treated for Klebsiella pneumonia and is currently on pressure support ventilation due to volume overload and acute renal failure. The patient also has COPD and is being treated with MDIs including albuterol. 

The patient's sepsis is caused by coag-negative Staph bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. He has completed a full course of vancomycin and micafungin. The sputum has also grown yeast, and the urine has grown yeast as well. 

The patient's acute renal failure is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine levels are increasing, but previous values may not be accurate due to hemodialysis treatments. 

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis appears to be improving, and he is tolerating tube feeds well. His type II diabetes is slightly elevated, but not out of control. 

The patient has a history of GI bleed and received a blood transfusion yesterday. He is being monitored for anemia and will continue with erythropoietin and IV proton pump inhibitor. 

The patient is also experiencing agitation and anxiety, and citalopram has been started for depression. Consideration is being given to using ativan if anxiety worsens. 

The goals of care include updating the family daily, keeping the patient out of bed daily"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS, SEVERE (WITH ORGAN DYSFUNCTION)
 INEFFECTIVE COPING
   83 yo male with initial admission with pancreatitis and now with
   prolonged hospital course with most recent active issues related to
   persistent respiratory failure, renal failure and sepsis.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Some improvement in secretions through to today
   which is encouraging for improvement in pneumoniaa nd he has been able
   to tolerate PSV 5/5 for extended periods.  It may be that with OOB to
   chair and establishing a mechanical advantage to aid in effective
   ventilation that he will be able to wean from ventilator
   -PSV 5/5 today
   -Will return to full PSV overnight
   -FIO2 weaned
   -Cefepime and inhaled tobramycin in place
   2)Renal Failure-Patient has had continued stability of Cr. suggesting

   fluid removal.
   -Will continue to use Lasix as tolerated to effect volume removal.
   -Goal negative one liter today given stability of Cr and mild rise in
   CVP through to today
   -Will decrease Lasix gtt rate today
   3)Sepsis-
   -ABX completed for coag negative staph bacteremia
   -Micafungin completed for postiive cath tip findings.
   -Will look to wean of vasporessin today

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and sepsis. He has been admitted with multiple medical complications, including diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pain control issues. The patient's current condition shows improvement in secretions and tolerance of pressure support ventilation (PSV). He is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and requires ongoing fluid removal through Lasix. Antibiotic treatment has been completed for coag-negative staph bacteremia, and antifungal treatment has been completed for positive catheter tip findings. Vasopressin weaning is planned today. The patient also has acute renal failure, pancreatitis, and chronic anemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. Despite some improvement in secretions, he remains dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration if the patient does not improve or if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy site infection.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, as he has ongoing fluid removal with Lasix and a stable creatinine level. Acute kidney injury (AKI) may occur if there is a sudden deterioration in renal function or if the fluid removal is excessive.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure,
   improving renal failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Currently on pressure support, not tolerating [**10-29**] as well (based on
   ABGs), on 15/5 currently.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, careful not to
   diurese more than 2L per day
   - if pt can tolerate, try Spont breathing trial today
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   - Will re-culture blood 10/6 to assess for re-growth per ID
concern of
   endocarditis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  over 100cc/hr on lasix gtt
   10mg/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of -1L ; may need to
   decrease lasix gtt to be able to wean off vasopressin
   - renal continuing to follow
   - Monitor UOP and daily Cr
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving, although
   radiographically appears the same.
   - feeds through [**Month/Day (4) **] tube without problems
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in 1 wk
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, improving renal failure, and sepsis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments for his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia. He is currently on pressure support and may require further interventions such as tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and yeast infection. He is being treated with antibiotics and antifungal medication.
3. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient's renal function is presumed to be due to ATN. He is on a lasix drip to maintain adequate urine output and avoid further hemodialysis.
4. Gallstone pancreatitis: Although the patient's clinical condition appears to be improving, radiographically, there is no change. Continued monitoring and management are required.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type II DM, and his blood sugar levels are slightly elevated after starting tube feeds. Insulin management will be continued.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed and has been transfused with packed red blood cells. Monitoring of Hct and ongoing EPO administration will be continued.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Currently on pressure support, not tolerating [**10-29**] as well (based on
   ABGs), on 15/5 currently.   Pt currently on lasix drip. Currently
   appears intravascularly depleted.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, careful not to
   diurese more than 2L per day; will re-check fluid status in PM and if
   diuresing well, will d/c lasix
   - Try Spont breathing trial today
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   - Will re-culture blood [**10-29**] in afternoon to assess for re-growth per
   ID
concern of endocarditis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  over 100cc/hr on lasix gtt
   10mg/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - Wean lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of -1L ; may need to decrease
   lasix gtt to be able to wean off vasopressin
   - renal continuing to follow
   - Monitor UOP and daily Cr
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving, although
   radiographically appears the same.
   - feeds through [**Month/Day (1) **] tube without problems
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # Right Sided Swelling: Patient appears to have a decrease in edema in
   left over right.
   - RUE and RLE ultrasound pending
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in 1 wk

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently being treated for klebsiella pneumonia and has a new pseudomonas infection in his sputum. The patient is also experiencing gallstone pancreatitis, right-sided swelling, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and agitation/anxiety. His goals of care include daily updates for the family, keeping the patient out of bed, and ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure secondary to klebsiella pneumonia. He is currently on pressure support ventilation and is being treated with antibiotics. However, there is a possibility of worsening respiratory failure due to the new pseudomonas infection in his sputum.

2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis caused by coagulation-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. Although the patient has been treated with vancomycin and micafungin, there is still a risk of sepsis recurrence due to the presence of yeast in the urine and sputum.

3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine levels are increasing, but it is difficult to determine the actual glomerular function as previous Cr"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and is currently on a lasix drip to manage volume overload. The patient also has pseudomonas in his sputum, which may be contributing to his respiratory failure. He is being treated with cefepime and inhaled tobramycin, and his underlying COPD is being managed with MDIs including albuterol.

The patient's sepsis is being treated with a full course of vancomycin and micafungin, which were discontinued on [**10-28**]. He has also grown yeast in his urine and sputum. The patient continues on pressors and is being closely monitored.

The patient's acute renal failure is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). His creatinine levels are increasing, but previous values may not be accurate while on CVVH and HD. The goal is to avoid further hemodialysis (HD) and to wean the lasix drip while monitoring urine output and daily creatinine levels.

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis appears to be improving clinically, although radiographically it appears the same. He is being fed through a [**Month/Day (1) **] tube without problems, and erythromycin is being continued for gastric motility.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Currently on pressure support, not tolerating [**10-29**] as well (based on
   ABGs), on 15/5 currently.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, careful not to
   diurese more than 2L per day; will re-check fluid status in PM and if
   diuresing well, will d/c lasix
   - Try Spont breathing trial today
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   - Will re-culture blood 10/6 to assess for re-growth per ID
concern of
   endocarditis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  over 100cc/hr on lasix gtt
   10mg/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of -1L ; may need to
   decrease lasix gtt to be able to wean off vasopressin
   - renal continuing to follow
   - Monitor UOP and daily Cr
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving, although
   radiographically appears the same.
   - feeds through [**Month/Day (4) **] tube without problems
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in 1 wk
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by klebsiella pneumonia. He also has a history of gallstone pancreatitis, type II diabetes mellitus, anemia, and agitation/anxiety. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 131/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. His physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, clear lung fields, abdominal distention, and edema in both upper and lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia. There is a new pseudomonas infection in his sputum, which may contribute to his respiratory failure. It is important to continue the current antibiotics (cefepime and inhaled tobramycin) and treat his underlying COPD with MDIs including albuterol.

2. Sepsis: The patient had coagulation-negative Staph bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. He should have been treated with full courses of vancomycin and micafungin, both of which were discontinued on 10/28."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure,
   improving renal failure and now with sepsis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure and abdominal distention impeding lung expansion.
   Currently on pressure support, not tolerating [**10-29**] as well (based on
   ABGs), on 15/5 currently.   Pt currently on lasix drip, tolerating
   well.
   - new pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, careful not to
   diurese more than 2L per day
   - if pt can tolerate, try Spont breathing trial today
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient continues on pressors.
   - sputum culture from [**2153-10-20**] is growing resistant pseudomonas with
   small amount of klebsiella, sputum cx from [**10-25**] with Gram negative
   rods, will f/u final cultures and speciation
   - for pan-sensitive Klebsiella in sputum, will change to zosyn based on
   pseudomonas sensitivites
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime
   - patient only on vasopressin for BP support, will wean as tolerated
   - Will re-culture blood 10/6 to assess for re-growth per ID
concern of
   endocarditis.
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt continues to respond very well to the lasix
   drip, making good urine, with urine output  over 100cc/hr on lasix gtt
   10mg/hr. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN.  Creatinine
   increasing, but cannot consider previous Cr values accurate while on
   CVVH and HD, so actual glomerular function is not likely
   worsening
likely improving due to improved ability to produce urine.
   Goal to avoid further HD.
   - continue lasix drip, titrated to goal I/Os of -1L ; may need to
   decrease lasix gtt to be able to wean off vasopressin
   - renal continuing to follow
   - Monitor UOP and daily Cr
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improving, although
   radiographically appears the same.
   - feeds through [**Month/Day (4) **] tube without problems
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM, sugars slightly elevated over last day or so
   after tube feeds have started, but not out of control
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  transfused 1unit pRBCs yesterday to Hct
   24.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - consider ativan if anxiety worsens
   - continue citalopram 10mg and consider increase to 20mg in 1 wk
   .
   # Goals of care:
   -          update family daily
   -          patient OOB Daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with pancreatitis, respiratory failure, improving renal failure, and sepsis. He has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and is currently on a lasix drip, tolerating well. The patient also has underlying COPD and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. He has been started on citalopram for depression but may have more grief than depression. The patient's goals of care include updating the family daily and keeping the patient out of bed daily.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload.
2. Sepsis caused by coag-neg staph bacteremia and yeast infection.
3. Acute renal failure due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
4. Gallstone pancreatitis that appears to be improving.
5. Type II diabetes with slightly elevated blood sugars.
6. Anemia due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Agitation and anxiety, possibly related to grief or depression.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information and evaluation may be necessary for a complete assessment."

   depletion; we have been diuresing him aggressively given his total body
   volume overload. We are reducing lasix infusion (and will try to stop
   today), but would continue to run negative fluid balance, albeit less
   than in the past 48 hours - goal 1L negative fluid balance for the day.
   Creat has been stable; BUN up slightly in the past week with diuresis.
   On rounds, patient placed on PSV 5/5 and FIO2 reduced to 0.5. Patient
   appears comfortable with RR < 20 and O2 sat at 100%. I would not be
   overly concerned about PaCO2 in the high 50's with pH above 7.30. His
   kidneys may be able to make adequate bicarb to compensate (last bicarb
   29). Higher PaCO2 will ultimately make it easier for him to breathe off
   the ventilator.
   Completing course of antibiotics.
   Try to place PICC and remove central venous access and dialysis

The patient is a 69-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, renal failure, and pancreatitis. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on various medications including lasix, vasopressin, heparin sodium, and others. His vital signs are stable with a blood pressure of 105/50 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He has a tracheostomy tube in place and is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 731 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 of 49 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 180. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of jaundice or clubbing. Lab results indicate elevated WBC count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and other abnormalities. The patient's renal function is compromised with a baseline BUN/creatinine of 26-27/1.4-1.5. He also has acute pancreatitis with elevated lipase levels and CT scan findings consistent with inflammation. The patient's pain is controlled with IV morphine"

   # Chest pain
   New this AM, describes tightening.  Cardiac enzymes negative.  EKG
   shows LBBB, which he has had in the past, though last EKG on [**10-25**] does
   not show LBBB.  Cannot evaluate ST-T wave elevations in setting of
   LBBB.  Likely has unstable angina.

   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off pressors this AM, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#10 of 21 day course)

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications. These include unstable angina, respiratory failure secondary to klebsiella pneumonia, sepsis from coag-negative staph bacteremia and yeast infection, acute kidney injury (ATN), gallstone pancreatitis, right-sided swelling without evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), anemia with a history of gastrointestinal bleed, and agitation/anxiety. The patient's goals of care include daily updates for the family and out-of-bed (OOB) activities in the ICU. The patient is receiving various treatments and medications to manage his conditions and prevent complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Unstable angina: The patient's chest pain and negative cardiac enzymes suggest unstable angina. It is important to monitor his blood pressure and restart pressors if necessary. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of myocardial infarction or worsening chest pain.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia. Continuous treatment with cefepime and inhaled tobramycin is recommended based on the sensitivity results. The patient's underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be managed with MDIs including albuterol. Monitoring his respiratory status and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis and has been treated for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and yeast infection in the catheter tip. He also has pneumonia caused by Klebsiella and resistant Pseudomonas. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, sepsis, acute on chronic renal failure, gallstone pancreatitis, right-sided swelling, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and agitation/anxiety. The goals of care include updating the family daily, maintaining the patient out of bed daily, and providing ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload. He is currently on pressure support and being treated with antibiotics. There is a possibility of further deterioration if the infection does not respond to treatment.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been treated for sepsis caused by coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia and yeast infection. Although he is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics, there is still a risk of recurrence if the infection persists or if new infections occur.
3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal failure is presumed to be due to acute tubular necrosis (AT"

   CHEST PAIN
   ============================
   Making slow progress with weaning from ventilator. Major impediment is
   complaint of dyspnea. Continuing to aim for negative fluid balance each
   day to alleviate chest wall. Seems to be at limit of kidney's ability
   to compensate for respiratory acidosis with serum bicarb of 29. Will
   begin oral bicarbonate. During rounds, patient placed on PSV 5/5 (down
   from [**8-29**]) with no change in resp rate or tidal volume. Continue to push
   patient to proceed with weaning program.
   Patient compliaining of chest discomfort this AM - tight sensation in
   upper epigastric region. Will obtain ECG. Try TNG.
   Blood pressure has stabilized off vasopressors.
   Creat stable. Urine output remains good. Goal for negative fluid
   balance of 0.5-1.0 L each day.
   ==============
   Addendum: ECG shows new LBBB. Will give TNG for present discomfort and
   repeat ECG. Check cardiac enzymes.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. They have respiratory failure, renal failure, pancreatitis, and anemia. The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU. They have been experiencing negative fluid balance, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, and difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to dyspnea. The patient also complains of chest discomfort, which may be related to cardiac issues as indicated by a new left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG. Other issues include impaired airway clearance, impaired balance and gait, impaired motor function, impaired ventilation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chest pain. They are currently on various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, analgesics, and renal replacement therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is compromised, leading to difficulty in breathing and maintaining adequate oxygenation.
2. Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, resulting in inadequate filtration and excretion of waste products.
3. Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas is present, which can lead to complications such as abdominal pain, organ dysfunction, and systemic inflammation.
4. Anemia: The patient has low levels of red blood cells, leading to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity and potential tissue hypoxia.
5. Chest Pain: The patient is experiencing discomfort in the chest, which may be indicative of cardiac involvement or other thoracic pathology.
6. Impaired Airway Clearance: The patient's ability to clear secretions and mucus from the airways is compromised, increasing the risk of pneumonia or other respiratory infections.
7. Impaired Balance and Gait: The patient exhibits impaired balance and coordination, which can lead to falls and injuries.
8. Impaired Motor Function: The patient has reduced muscle strength and control, affecting their ability to move and perform daily activities.
9. Impaired Ventilation: The patient's respiratory muscles are weakened, making it difficult to maintain adequate ventilation and gas exchange.
10. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin is at risk of breakdown and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and inadequate tissue perfusion.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to improve the patient's overall condition and prevent further deterioration."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure.   On pressure support overnight and this AM on
   [**8-29**]. pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #10 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -500mL for today, no more
   than 1L per day
   - decrease Pressure Support and try on [**5-29**] for most of day
   .
   # Chest/Abdominal pain
   New yesterday, describes tightening.  Cardiac enzymes negative x3.  EKG
   shows LBBB, which he has had in the past, though last EKG on [**10-25**] does
   not show LBBB.  Cannot evaluate ST-T wave elevations in setting of
   LBBB.  Not thought to be cardiac pain.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off pressors this AM, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient back on
   vasopressin this AM.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#11 of 21 day course)
   - patient back on vasopressin this AM
 try to wean off again
   - f/u blood cultures from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt was off lasix drip overnight but had very
   good response to it earlier.  Cr 2.5, stable for days, so his kidneys
   appear stable.  Hopefully didn
t have another hit to kidneys from
   hypotensive episode yesterday.
   - Restarted lasix gtt this AM per Renal recs at low dose for net I/O
   goal of -1L
   - Renal suggested starting midodrine for BP, but will hold off at this
   time
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improved, tolerated
   PEG tube feeds
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg yesterday
   - continue citalopram and continue encouragement of patient
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily
   - patient OOB Daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia and is currently on a 21-day course of cefepime. He also has underlying COPD and is being treated with MDIs including albuterol.

The patient presented with chest pain, which was initially thought to be cardiac-related but later determined not to be cardiac pain. The EKG showed a left bundle branch block (LBBB), which the patient had in the past. The cardiac enzymes were negative, so no cardiac intervention was taken.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis caused by coag-negative staphylococcal bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. He has been treated with vancomycin and micafungin, both of which were discontinued on October 28th. The patient's sputum also grew pansensitive klebsiella.

The patient's renal function has been improving, with a stable creatinine level of 2.5. His kidneys appear stable, and he is being closely monitored by the renal team. The patient was off the lasix drip overnight but had a good response to it earlier, so it was restarted at a low dose.

The patient has a history of gallstone pancreatitis and has tolerated PEG tube feeds well. He is being treated with eryth"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 s/p tracheostomy ([**9-28**]) and s/p right sided
   thoracentesis ([**10-9**]) Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella
   pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the setting of
   acute renal failure.   On pressure support overnight and this AM on
   [**8-29**]. pseudomonas in his sputum, may be contributing to his respiratory
   failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #10 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -500mL for today, no more
   than 1L per day
   - decrease Pressure Support and try on [**5-29**] for most of day
   .
   # Epigastric pain
   New this AM, describes tightening.  Cardiac enzymes negative x3.  EKG
   shows LBBB, which he has had in the past, though last EKG on [**10-25**] does
   not show LBBB.  Cannot evaluate ST-T wave elevations in setting of
   LBBB.  [**Month (only) 51**] have unstable angina vs epigastric pain
   - give Nitro sublingual as needed and monitor blood pressure
   - may need to restart pressors to support blood pressure if Nitro drops
   BP
   - cycle Cardiac enzymes
   - Call cardiology if cardiac enzymes positive
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off pressors this AM, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#10 of 21 day course)
   - patient was briefly on pressors last night but not this AM
   - f/u blood cultures from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt was off lasix drip overnight but had very
   good response to it earlier.  Cr stable at 2.6-2.7 for last three days,
   so his kidneys appear stable. Renal failure presumed to be due to ATN,
   so he may be also having his post-ATN diuresis.
   - Restarted lasix gtt this AM per Renal recs at low dose for net I/O
   goal of -500cc
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improved, tolerated
   [**Month/Year (2) **] tube feeds
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # Right Sided Swelling: Patient appears to have a decrease in edema in
   left over right. RUE and RLE u/s negative for clots.  No concern for
   PE, so nothing further to do.
   - can continue to monitor and continue DVT prophylaxis of subq heparin
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable at 26.
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Agitation/anxiety:  Was started on citalopram 10mg last week for
   depression, but consider that he probably has more grief than
   depression.
   - increased citalopram to 20mg

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. He is currently on pressure support and receiving treatment for the underlying COPD.

2. Epigastric pain: The patient presents with new-onset epigastric pain described as tightening. Cardiac enzymes are negative, but there is a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on the EKG. The possibility of unstable angina or epigastric pain needs to be evaluated further.

3. Sepsis: The patient had coag-negative Staph bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. He should have been treated with a full course of vancomycin and micafungin, both of which were discontinued on October 28th. He also has yeast in the urine and pansensitive klebsiella in the sputum. Inhaled tobramycin and cefepime are being continued based on sensitivities and ID recommendations.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable at 2.6-2.7, indicating stable renal function. It is presumed to be acute on"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The chief complaints include respiratory failure, renal failure, chest pain, hypotension, pancreatitis, and anemia. The patient's condition has been worsening, as evidenced by increased oxygen requirements, decreased urine output, worsening edema, and ongoing need for vasopressin.

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute exacerbation, diabetes mellitus type II, and benign hypertension. They were admitted to the ICU due to severe sepsis with organ dysfunction, ineffective coping, diarrhea, alteration in nutrition, anemia, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired motor function, impaired ventilation, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and impaired skin integrity.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/50 mmHg to 82/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination revealed right and left lower extremity edema, warm skin without rash or jaundice, attentive behavior with purposeful movements, and oriented to time, place, and person.

Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies revealed"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a diagnosis of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient has several medical conditions including type II diabetes mellitus, anemia with a history of GI bleed, depression/anxiety, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 110/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on a ventilator in CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 463 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, regular heart rhythm without murmurs/rubs/gallops, rhonchorous sounds in the anterior upper chest, positive bowel sounds with distended abdomen but slightly softer than yesterday, and 3+ edema in both upper and lower extremities slightly increased from yesterday.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 11.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.6 g/dL, platelet count of 242 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 30 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.4 mg/dL, sodium of 138 mEq/L, potassium of 3.8 mEq/L, glucose of 69 mg/dL, and calcium of 8.0 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been treated with multiple medications including cefepime, tobramycin, vancomycin, micafungin, vasopressin, furosemide (Lasix), erythromycin, glargine, and citalopram. The patient also has a tracheostomy tube in place, a PEG tube, and a multi-lumen central venous catheter.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with ongoing support on the ventilator. The presence of pseudomonas and klebsiella in the sputum may contribute to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: Despite receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient remains at risk for sepsis due to the presence of yeast in the urine and catheter tip.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is improving but still requires close monitoring and management with Lasix.
4. Volume overload: The patient is experiencing volume overload as indicated by the high fluid balance and edema.
5. Pressure injuries: The patient's immobility and edema increase the risk for pressure injuries.
6. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to the presence of catheters and immunocompromised state.
7. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately.
8. Diabetes: The patient's diabetes needs to be managed with insulin therapy.
9. Depression/anxiety: The patient's mental health needs to be addressed with continued encouragement and medication.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**12-29**] overnight
   and then this AM on [**8-29**].  Was tried on PM valve very briefly but could
   not tolerate, so he was rested on PS [**12-31**].  Turned down to PS 5/5 on
   rounds.  pseudomonas in his sputum, may have been contributing to his
   respiratory failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #12 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -500mL for today, no more
   than 1L per day
   - let him exercise his lungs on Pressure Support and try on [**5-29**] for a
   few hours at a time, then rest
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off on vasopressin overnight, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient back on
   vasopressin this AM but turned down to 1.2/ hr.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#12 of 21 day course)
   - turn off vasopressin
   - f/u blood cultures from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.4,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.
   - continue lasix gtt for net I/O goal of -500- 1L
   - f/u renal recs
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improved, tolerated
   PEG tube feeds
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week
   - continue citalopram and continue encouragement
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily
   - continue Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently being treated for klebsiella pneumonia and has been diagnosed with coag-negative staph bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. He is on pressure support and being weaned off vasopressin.

The patient's sepsis is being treated with a full course of vancomycin and micafungin, both of which were discontinued on 10/28. His sputum has also grown yeast, and his urine has grown yeast as well. The patient's underlying COPD is being treated with MDIs including albuterol.

The patient's acute on chronic kidney condition is being managed with lasix drip to achieve a net input/output goal of -500mL for today, with no more than 1L per day. His renal function appears stable, with a creatinine level of 2.4.

The patient's gallstone pancreatitis seems to be clinically improving and he is tolerating PEG tube feeds. He is being continued on erythromycin for gastric motility.

The patient has type II diabetes and is on insulin. He is being continued on glargine 38u qhs and ISS.

The patient has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**12-29**] overnight
   and then this AM on [**8-29**].  Was tried on PM valve very briefly but could
   not tolerate, so he was rested on PS [**12-31**].  Turned down to PS 5/5 on
   rounds.  pseudomonas in his sputum, may have been contributing to his
   respiratory failure
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #12 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip w goal net Ins/Outs -500mL for today, no more
   than 1L per day
   - let him exercise his lungs on Pressure Support and try on [**5-29**] for a
   few hours at a time, then rest
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off on vasopressin overnight, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient back on
   vasopressin this AM but turned down to 1.2/ hr.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#12 of 21 day course)
   - turn off vasopressin
   - f/u blood cultures from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.4,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.
   - continue lasix gtt for net I/O goal of -500- 1L
   - f/u renal recs
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improved, tolerated
   PEG tube feeds
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week
   - continue citalopram and continue encouragement
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily
   - continue Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia, which is still being treated. The patient is on pressure support and has been tried on a PM valve but could not tolerate it. There is also volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient had coag-negative staph bacteremia and yeast growing from the catheter tip. Treatment for sepsis should have been completed with a full course of vancomycin and micafungin. The patient's urine also grew yeast, and sputum grew pansensitive klebsiella.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is stable and trending down slowly, indicating that his kidneys appear stable. The goal is to continue lasix gtt for a net I/O goal of -500 to 1L.

4. Gallstone Pancreatitis: The patient's condition appears to be improved and tolerated PEG tube feeds. It is recommended to continue erythromycin for gastric motility.

5. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II DM on insulin. It is important to continue glargine 38u qhs and ISS.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**5-29**] overnight and
   this AM.  Was tried on PM valve after SBT but tired  quickly so was
   changed back to PS 5/5.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #13 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - continue lasix drip to transition to lasix boluses w goal net
   Ins/Outs -1L for today, no more than 1L per day
   - let him exercise his lungs with SBT
s and PMV trials and rest
   inbetween on PS 5/5
   .
   # Sepsis:  Coag Neg Staph Bacteremia and yeast growing from catheter
   tip should be treated by now with full course of vancomycin and
   micafungin, both DCed [**10-28**].  Urine has also grown yeast, sputum grew
   pansensitive klebsiella.  Patient off on vasopressin overnight, but BP
   labile.   Most recent sputum cx from [**10-25**] with pseudomonas and
   klebsiella, sensitive to cefepime and tobramycin.  Patient back on
   vasopressin this AM but turned down to 1.2/ hr.
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin based on sensitivities and ID recs and
   cefepime (day#13 of 21 day course)
   - pt. off vasopressin for over 24 hours
   - f/u blood cultures from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.4,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.
   - will discontinue lasix gtt, and attempt lasix boluses to maintain
   urine output, will monitor BP and bolus as tolerated
   - I/O goal is -1L today
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Gallstone Pancreatitis
 clinically appears to be improved, tolerated
   PEG tube feeds
   - continue erythromycin for gastric motility
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week
   - continue citalopram and encouragement
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - update family daily
   - continue Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He has been diagnosed with gallstone pancreatitis, pneumonia caused by klebsiella and pseudomonas, coag-negative staph bacteremia, and yeast infection. The patient has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus type II, anemia, and depression/anxiety. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving treatment for his various conditions, including antibiotics and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 137/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals crackles in the anterior upper chest, edema in both upper and lower extremities, and a positive blood glucose level of 202 mg/dL. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's fluid balance is positive with a total input of 1,499 mL and output of 2,425 mL since midnight. The patient is currently on a lasix drip to manage fluid overload and is being monitored closely.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status may deteriorate further due to the ongoing infection and underlying COPD"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with multiple comorbidities including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, anemia, pancreatitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing some progress in weaning off the ventilator. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and they have maintained a negative fluid balance. The patient's creatinine levels have improved slightly. They are completing a course of antibiotics and have stable hematocrit levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure and a history of COPD exacerbation. There is a potential risk of further respiratory compromise, especially if there are any complications with weaning off the ventilator.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and their baseline BUN/creatinine levels were elevated. Close monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, indicating a possible issue with blood pressure regulation. This could be related to sepsis or other underlying conditions.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which may be contributing to their overall poor condition. Further evaluation and management of anemia is required.

5. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, as indicated by inflammation seen on CT scan and elevated lip"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**5-29**] overnight and
   this AM switched to [**8-29**].  Off pressors for >24hrs.  BP from art line
   does not correlate to BP cuff.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #14 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - consider D/C A-line
 still getting frequent ABGs at this time though
   BPs stable
   - lasix boluses w goal net Ins/Outs -1L to -1.5L
   - hold off on PS 5/5 and SBT trials until diuresed much better
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.1,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.
   - will use lasix boluses to goal I/O net -1-1.5 L
   - pm lytes
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week. Responded well to ativan this AM 0.5 mg w anxiety. Must be
   careful to recognize when anxiety is secondary to dyspnea vs when
   dyspnea is secondary to anxiety and not treat any anxiety w ativan
   without recognizing causality
   - continue citalopram and encouragement
   - ativan prn anxiety but on request to MD, not written as PRN
   - switched trazodone to ambien to see if it works better
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his history and hospital
   course and was present for the key portion of the services provided.  I
   have reviewed the note by Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**] and I agree with her findings and
   plan of care.  The patient has survived pancreatitis and prolonged resp
   and renal failure secondary to it. He is now on only low levels of PSV

s off CVVH and urinating on his own with improving
   creatinine.  He is still wet by CXR and even on PSV of [**8-29**] he has abg
   of 7.33/62/74, and when PSV is lowered to [**5-29**] he has RSBreathing.
   Hence my desire to dry him out more first, following CXR, before over
   working his resp muscles.  I would use Ativan only prn now but would
   continue antidepressants. I also think another trial of Passy Muir
   valve intermittently for 5-10min would allow him to communicate his
   needs and feelings better to us.  We are working on his transfer to a
   resp rehab facililty for ongoing care.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been treated for klebsiella pneumonia. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia. He is on pressure support and may require tracheostomy tube and ventilator support. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has stable kidneys but still requires careful management of fluid balance and diuretics. There is a risk of worsening renal function or fluid overload if not properly managed.
3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has type II DM and is on insulin therapy. There is a risk of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia if insulin doses are not adjusted appropriately.
4. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed, and his Hct levels are stable. There is a risk of further bleeding or worsening anemia if not monitored and treated appropriately.
5. Depression/anxiety: The patient is being treated for depression and anxiety. There is a risk of worsening psychiatric symptoms if not appropriately managed.
6. Potential complications from central venous catheterization: The patient has arterial and PICC"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**5-29**] overnight and
   this AM.  Was tried on PM valve after SBT but tired  quickly so was
   changed back to PS 5/5.   Off pressors for >24hrs.  BP from art line
   does not correlate to BP cuff.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #14 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - consider D/C A-line
   - transition to lasix boluses w goal net Ins/Outs -1L for today, no
   more than 1L per day
   - let him exercise his lungs with SBT
s and PMV trials and rest in
   between on PS 5/5
   - f/u blood cx from 10/.6
   .
   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.4,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.
   - will discontinue lasix gtt, and attempt lasix boluses to maintain
   urine output, will monitor BP and bolus as tolerated
   - I/O goal is -1L today
   - pm lytes
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week
   - continue citalopram and encouragement
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. He has been on pressure support and has recently been switched to a higher level of pressure support. His blood pressure is stable, and he is being treated with lasix boluses to achieve a net fluid output of -1L to -1.5L. The patient has type II diabetes and is on insulin therapy. He also has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and is being monitored for anemia. Additionally, the patient is being treated for depression and anxiety.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. There is a potential complication of worsening respiratory failure if the underlying cause is not effectively treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially worsen if not adequately managed.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has improving renal failure, but there is still a risk of further deterioration if fluid balance and diuretic therapy are not appropriately managed.
4. Diabetes management: The patient has type II diabetes, and his glycemic control should be closely"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**8-29**] for past 24
   hours with minimal change in ABG.  Off pressors for >24hrs.  BP from
   art line does not correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is
   highly fluid overloaded in lungs which is likely compromising his
   respiratory status
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #15 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - lasix boluses w goal net Ins/Outs -1L to -1.5L
   - hold off on PS 5/5 and SBT trials until diuresed much better, but
   trial of Passy Muir valve intermittently for 5-10min would allow him to
   communicate his needs and feelings better to us
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
   - Diurese today to

   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Cr 2.3, stable for days.  UOP
   decreasing overnight. Given lasix boluses with modest effect, and also
   decrease in BP after bolus
   - stop boluses for now and re-institute lasix gtt to increase uop and
   improve respiratory function

   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  Patient appears to be sleeping more during day.
   Started ambien prn, so this may likely be the cause. Also, depression
   in itself can cause this. He was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier
   this week. Responded well to ativan eariler 0.5 mg w anxiety. Must be
   careful to recognize when anxiety is secondary to dyspnea vs when
   dyspnea is secondary to anxiety and not treat any anxiety w ativan
   without recognizing causality

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course, and
   was present for the key portions of the services provided. I have also
   reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10611**]
a note and agree with her findings and plan of
   care.  Mr [**Known lastname 9611**] is stable though still seeming depressed and a little
   sleepy. However he remains clinically fluid overloaded with what seems
   like large pleural effusions on exam and CXR.  The goal will be to
   reinstate lasix drip to see if we can get fluid off of him, improve
   lung compliance, and thus allow him to breathe more easily, as right
   now even on PSV of [**8-29**] his pH is 7.32 and PC02 in the upper 60
   We
ve spoken to Mrs [**Last Name (STitle) 10662**] about the patient
s condition and our plans.
   Meanwhile pulm [**Hospital **] rehab will be explored come early next week.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical conditions and goals of care.

The patient's respiratory status is still compromised due to volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. He is being treated with cefepime and inhaled tobra for klebsiella pneumonia. Pressure support has been initiated, but there has been minimal change in ABG. The patient is also receiving lasix boluses to diurese and balance his fluid status. A trial of passy muir valve is being intermittently used to allow communication.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.3 and decreasing urine output overnight. Lasix boluses have been given with modest effect, and there has been a decrease in blood pressure after bolus administration.

The patient has type II diabetes and is on insulin therapy. His anemia is due to a history of GI bleed, and his Hct is stable. EPO is being continued, as well as IV PPI.

Depression/anxiety has been noted, and the patient is sleeping more during the day. Ambien has been started, but caution is advised regarding its use. Citalopram has been increased to 20mg, and ativan has been used for anxiety.

The patient's goals of care include continuing daily physical therapy"

 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**5-29**] overnight and
   this AM switched to [**8-29**].  Off pressors for >24hrs.  BP from art line
   does not correlate to BP cuff.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #15 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - consider D/C A-line
 still getting frequent ABGs at this time though
   BPs stable
   - lasix boluses w goal net Ins/Outs -1L to -1.5L
   - hold off on PS 5/5 and SBT trials until diuresed much better, but
   trial of Passy Muir valve intermittently for 5-10min would allow him to
   communicate his needs and feelings better to us
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]

   # Acute on chronic --  Pt restarted on lasix gtt yesterday.  Cr 2.1,
   stable for days and trending down slowly, so his kidneys appear
   stable.

   # Depression/anxiety:  was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier this
   week. Responded well to ativan this AM 0.5 mg w anxiety. Must be
   careful to recognize when anxiety is secondary to dyspnea vs when
   dyspnea is secondary to anxiety and not treat any anxiety w ativan
   without recognizing causality

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for klebsiella pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to the pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. He has been on pressure support and has recently been switched to a mode called PSV.

The patient's blood pressure readings from the arterial line do not correlate with the blood pressure cuff readings. Lasix boluses are being given to achieve a net loss of 1-1.5 liters of fluid. The patient's kidneys appear stable, with a creatinine level of 2.1, which has been trending down slowly.

The patient has type II diabetes and is on insulin. His Hct levels are stable, indicating that his anemia is under control. He is being monitored closely for any signs of GI bleeding. The patient has also been prescribed citalopram for depression and anxiety, and he has responded well to ativan for anxiety.

The patient's goals of care include continuing daily physical therapy and trying to get him out of bed daily. His nutritional needs are being met through a NovaSource Renal (Full) formula at 40 mL/hour. The patient's arterial line and PICC line are in place for monitoring and medication administration.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to prolonged ICU stay, further decline"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has pleural effusions, which need to be addressed. He is also experiencing fluid overload in his lungs due to acute renal failure. His blood pressure is not correlating with the readings from the arterial line, suggesting possible fluid overload. The patient has a history of COPD and his respiratory status is compromised. His kidney function is improving, but he still has elevated BUN levels. The patient also has a history of GI bleeding, type II DM, and anemia. He is being treated with citalopram for depression/anxiety. The goals of care include improving respiratory function, managing renal failure, and providing appropriate nutrition and physical therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. The patient may require further interventions such as increased pressure support and ABG analysis to optimize his respiratory function.

2. Fluid overload: The patient has significant pleural effusions and evidence of fluid overload in his lungs. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary edema. The patient's fluid status should be closely monitored and managed with diuretics.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's"

 Respiratory failure likely secondary to
   klebsiella pneumonia, still being treated and volume overload in the
   setting of acute renal failure.   On pressure support [**8-29**] for past 24
   hours with minimal change in ABG.  Off pressors for >24hrs.  BP from
   art line does not correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is
   highly fluid overloaded in lungs which is likely compromising his
   respiratory status
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #15 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - lasix boluses w goal net Ins/Outs -1L to -1.5L
   - hold off on PS 5/5 and SBT trials until diuresed much better, but
   trial of Passy Muir valve intermittently for 5-10min would allow him to
   communicate his needs and feelings better to us

   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Cr 2.3, stable for days.  UOP
   decreasing overnight. Given lasix boluses with modest effect, and also
   decrease in BP after bolus
   - stop boluses for now and re-institute lasix gtt to increase uop and
   improve respiratory function

   # Depression/anxiety:  Patient appears to be sleeping more during day.
   Started ambien prn, so this may likely be the cause. Also, depression
   in itself can cause this. He was increased to citalopram 20mg earlier
   this week. Responded well to ativan eariler 0.5 mg w anxiety. Must be
   careful to recognize when anxiety is secondary to dyspnea vs when
   dyspnea is secondary to anxiety and not treat any anxiety w ativan
   without recognizing causality
   - continue citalopram and encouragement
   - ativan prn anxiety but on request to MD, not written as PRN
   - Consider hold ambien in setting of increased sleepiness during day,
   this may not be metabolized well and lingering in patient.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**8-29**] but feels tired.  BP from art line does not
   correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is highly fluid overloaded
   in lungs which is likely compromising his respiratory status
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #16 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - lasix gtt for net goal I/Os -1L for the day
   - get ABG, then increase PS to [**10-29**] to give him more inspiratory
   support and recheck ABG after an hour
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
   - CXR in AM
   - call IP tomorrow to take a look at effusions and possibly tap him
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure - Cr 2.2, stable for days, slight
   improvement.
   - continue lasix gtt to increase uop and improve respiratory function
   - pm lytes
   .
   # Increasing BUN:
   Has been Guaiac positive and has hx of GI bleed in past, so may be
   related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now.  Creatinine stable, so not
   likely related to intravascular volume.
   - cont to monitor Hct and BUN
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   Has been on citalopram 20mg dose x about 1 week.
   - increase citalopram to 40mg and encouragement
   - Consider hold ambien in setting of increased sleepiness during day,
   this may not be metabolized well and lingering in patient.
   - put on Passe-Miur Valve on w cuff deflated (Still attached to Vent)
   when family comes once/day to allow him to communicate
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   MICU Attending Addendum
   On this day I examined the patient, reviewed his hospital course, labs,
   and imaging, and I was present for the key portions of the services
   provided.  I have also reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 10501**]
s note above and agree with
   her findings and plan of care.  Mr [**Known lastname 9611**] by CXR and exam still seems to
   be suffering from massive third space fluid, including in his pleural
   spaces. It
s not been easy to diurese him consistently every day, and
   yet his lack of progress is contributing to his depression and
   withdrawn affect.  While we
ll continue lasix drip at a higher dose
   today with the goal of 1.5 L neg by the AM, we
ll also ask
   interventional pulmonary to see him tomorrow and consider therapeutic
   thoracentesis is effusions confirmed.  He looks like he
s not
   comfortable breathing and states as much and with PCO2 in the 60
s with
   acidemia, I think he should be given a bit more vent support until his
   work of breathing from his effusions is much less. I also think another
   set of Passy Muir valve trials may help his ability to communicate and
   hence his spirits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving cefepime and inhaled tobra for klebsiella pneumonia.
- He is also being treated for underlying COPD with MDIs, including albuterol.
- Lasix gtt has been started to achieve a net goal of -1L for the day.
- The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to fluid overload in the lungs.
- An arterial line and PICC line have been placed.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are being monitored, and he is receiving insulin for type II DM.
- Anemia is suspected due to a history of GI bleed, but Hct is stable.
- The patient is on citalopram for depression and anxiety, which will be increased to 40mg.
- Goals of care include continuing daily physical therapy, attempting to get the patient out of bed daily, and allowing communication with the family using a Passe-Miur Valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to fluid overload in the lungs, which can lead to further respiratory distress and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating renal dysfunction. This can lead to further kidney"

   RADIOLOGY: CXR: Large bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**8-29**] but feels tired.  BP from art line does not
   correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is highly fluid overloaded
   in lungs which is likely compromising his respiratory status; unsure of
   size of pleural effusions
   - lasix gtt stopped as patient is diuresing well on own after fluid
   bolus.  Since increase in UOP was fluid responsive, patient may be
   intravascularly depleted and not mobilizing third space fluid fast
   enough (LOS Fluid balance: +30 L). Minimal UOP should be at least 40-80
   cc/hr. Goal should be -500 cc to
 1 liter today.
   - Check I/O
s TID. [**Month (only) 51**] need to turn lasix gtt on at times to increase
   UOP as blood pressure can tolerate. If patient appears fluid down (
   based on CVP measures) can attempt small boluses to increase UOP.
   - call IP today to take a look at effusions and possibly tap him; as
   this may help his breathing considerably
unsure if gentle diuresis will
   aid in weaning patient in the short term.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #17 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - get ABG, then increase PS to [**10-29**] to give him more inspiratory
   support and recheck ABG after an hour

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/51 mmHg to 87/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert but has difficulty speaking. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds at the bases and lateral chest, clear anterior chest, and diffuse wheezing sounds. There is also evidence of edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal limits. Radiology shows large bilateral pleural effusions. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. There is a concern about the size of the pleural effusions, which may further impair his breathing.
2. Fluid Overload: The patient is highly fluid overloaded, as indicated by his CXR and fluid balance (+30 L). This could lead to worsening respiratory failure and other complications.
3. Intravascular Depletion: The patient may be intravascularly depleted"

   RADIOLOGY: CXR: Large bilateral pleural effusions
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**8-29**] but feels tired.  BP from art line does not
   correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is highly fluid overloaded
   in lungs which is likely compromising his respiratory status; unsure of
   size of pleural effusions
   - lasix gtt stopped as patient is diuresing well on own after fluid
   bolus.  Since increase in UOP was fluid responsive, patient may be
   intravascularly depleted and not mobilizing third space fluid fast
   enough (LOS Fluid balance: +30 L). Minimal UOP should be at least 40-80
   cc/hr. Goal should be -500 cc to
 1 liter today if possible
   - Since UOP is not responsive to lasix; likely volume down. Hold lasix
   for now and check I/O
s at 2 pm. If UOP is not at least 0.5 cc/hr
   consider 250 cc fluid bolus. Since albumin is only 2.1; consider
   colloid.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. Hold
   off for now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #17 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean PS down to 5 if patient can tolerate.
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.3, BUN
   increased from 103 to 114; further supporting possible  intravascular
   volume depletion.
   - UOP goal as above to maintain adequate intravascular volume
    - pm lytes if lasix gtt turned on
   - Regarding increasing BUN, as been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now
   - cont to monitor Hct and BUN and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT last
   week
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - Consider hold ambien in setting of increased sleepiness during day,
   this may not be metabolized well and lingering in patient.
   - place on Passe-Miur Valve on w cuff deflated (Still attached to Vent)
   when family comes once/day to allow him to communicate; if respiratory
   status allows
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   83 yo M w/ prolonged hospital course in setting of severe GS
   pancreatitis c/b MODS.
   Ongoing issues remain:
          Respiratory failure
          ARF on CRI
          PSA/Kleb pna
          Total body volume overload/third spacing
          Depression/anxiety
          Anemia
          Leukocytosis (improving)
   He remains vent dependent (ON PSV) in setting of resolving VAP, ongoing
   volume overload w/ third spacing, pulm edema and effusions on
   underlying significant COPD with chronic CO2 retention.  His abd
   remains distended further impacting his resp status and ability to wean
   from vent.
   Agree with plan to continue PSV.  He seems to need the PEEP in setting
   of b/l pleural effusions and persistent abd distention.  Does not
   appear ready for more aggressive wean to TC.  Will consider tapping his
   effusions, though with his low albumin suspect fluid will
   reaccumulate.  He remains on cef and inhaled tobra to complete a 21 day
   course for psa/kleb pna.  He is af now and wbc is trending down.
   Suspect his cr is at a new baseline.  He remains  total body vol
   overloaded but intravascularly dry with BUN increasing in setting of
   diuresis.  He remains anemic, but without evidence of acute bleeding or
   hct drop. Would hold on additional lasix and allow to re-equilibrate.
   Would consider additional fluid boluses with albumin. No other
   indication for colloid at this time.  Continue epo.
   He continue to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   Remainder as per resident note.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to severe acute pancreatitis complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), and has a positive blood culture for PSA/Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient also has total body volume overload with third spacing, pulmonary edema, and effusions, as well as significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with chronic carbon dioxide retention. His abdomen remains distended, which further impacts his respiratory status and ability to wean from the ventilator. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count), anemia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated D-dimer levels. Imaging reveals large effusions layering beneath the patient. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient remains ventilator-dependent on pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ongoing volume overload with third spacing, pulmonary edema, and effusions. There is also significant abdominal distention impacting his respiratory status and ability to wean from the ventilator.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF) on CRI: The patient's renal function is being managed with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI).
3. PSA/Klebsiella pneumonia: The patient is being treated with cef"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe acute pancreatitis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). He is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications including sepsis with organ dysfunction, ineffective coping, diarrhea, alteration in nutrition, anemia, impaired aerobic capacity/endurance, impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired motor function, impaired ventilation, atrial fibrillation (AFIB), impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin (FUO), acute renal failure (ARF), acute pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), pain control, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), and benign hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is a major concern. He has impaired airway clearance, impaired balance, impaired gait, impaired knowledge, impaired motor function, and impaired ventilation. These factors put him at risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis with organ dysfunction. This indicates a systemic infection that may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), which can be attributed to his overall critical condition and the presence of multiple organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ prolonged hospital course in setting of severe GS
   pancreatitis.
   Ongoing issues remain:
          Respiratory failure
          ARF on CRI
          PSA/Kleb pna
          Total body volume overload/third spacing
          Depression/anxiety
          Anemia
          Leukocytosis (improving)
          Underlying COPD
   He remains vent dependent (ON PSV) in setting of resolving VAP, ongoing
   volume overload w/ third spacing, pulm edema and effusions on
   underlying significant COPD with chronic CO2 retention.  His abd
   remains distended further impacting his resp status and ability to wean
   from vent.
   Agree with plan to continue PSV.  He seems to need the small amt of
   PEEP in setting of b/l pleural effusions and persistent abd
   distention.  At this time he does not appear ready for more aggressive
   wean to TC.  Will consider tapping his effusions, though suspect this
   intervention may not have much impact and with his low albumin fluid
   will reaccumulate.  He remains on cefepime and inhaled tobra to
   complete a 21 day course for psa/kleb pna.  He is af now and his wbc
   continue to trend down.
   Suspect his cr may be at his new baseline.  But his BUN continues to
   rise.  He remains total body vol overloaded but intravascularly dry
   with BUN increasing most likely [**2-26**] diuresis and intravascular
   depletion.  He remains anemic, but without evidence of acute bleeding
   or hct drop. Would hold on additional lasix today and allow to
   re-equilibrate.  Would consider additional fluid bolus with albumin. No
   other indication for colloid at this time.  Continue epo.
   He continue to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   His mood remains very depressed.  His celexa was recently increased.
   Remainder as per resident note.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - tried PMV this AM --> HR went up and started desaturating
   - on PS 10/5 - want to try to decrease PS back down to 5/5 for ""sprint
   and rest"" trials
   - will not tap pleural effusions ; likely to reaccumulate
   - give him some time to mobilize fluids so that we can diurese him
   later; consider giving albumin ; can give some small colloid or
   crystalloid fluid boluses if urine output drops off
   - Day#17 of 21 of cefepime and inhaled tobra for Klebsiella and
   Pseudamonas in sputum
   - d/w nutrition about amt of protein w renal diet (has low albumin);
   consider also that BUN is high, renal concerned about GI bleed
   - has PICC line and no peripherals
   - tried giving albumin 2.5% in 500ccs, but ran super slowly (over many
   hours) through PICC line and didnt seem to make a difference
   - Desatted into mid 80s when turned on side, so RT turned him on to AC
   Vt450, RR10, PEEP8, FiO2 50%-- RT and nurse suctioned him out at that
   time... and turn back to PS 10/5 after a few hours;
   - UOP started to drop off 2300 (10-15cc/hr)--> tried 250cc bolus NS -->
   urine output picked up

   Chest X-Ray ([**11-5**]): unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions, L>R
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**8-29**] but feels tired.  BP from art line does not
   correlate to BP cuff.  Based on CXR, patient is highly fluid overloaded
   in lungs which is likely compromising his respiratory status; unsure of
   size of pleural effusions
   - ? continuing to replete colloid and restart lasix gtt and patient is
   overall fluid overloaded but gets intravascularly volume depleted with
   lasix, due to inability to mobilize fluid
   - lasix gtt stopped as patient is diuresing well on own after fluid
   bolus.  Since increase in UOP was fluid responsive, patient may be
   intravascularly depleted and not mobilizing third space fluid fast
   enough (LOS Fluid balance: +30 L). Minimal UOP should be at least 40-80
   cc/hr. Goal should be -500 cc to
 1 liter today if possible
   - Since UOP is not responsive to lasix; likely volume down. Hold lasix
   for now and check I/O
s at 2 pm. If UOP is not at least 0.5 cc/hr
   consider 250 cc fluid bolus. Since albumin is only 2.1; consider
   colloid.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. Hold
   off for now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #17 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean PS down to 5 if patient can tolerate.
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
NGTD
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased from 103 to 114; further supporting possible
   intravascular volume depletion.
   - UOP goal as above to maintain adequate intravascular volume
    - pm lytes if lasix gtt turned on
   - Regarding increasing BUN, as been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now
   - cont to monitor Hct and BUN and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT last
   week
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - Consider hold ambien in setting of increased sleepiness during day,
   this may not be metabolized well and lingering in patient.
   - place on Passe-Miur Valve on w cuff deflated (Still attached to Vent)
   when family comes once/day to allow him to communicate; if respiratory
   status allows
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   ability to be transferred to pulmonary rehab
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications. The patient's respiratory status is compromised due to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload caused by acute renal failure. He is on pressure support and is tired. There is a discrepancy between the blood pressure measured from the arterial line and the blood pressure cuff. The patient is highly fluid overloaded, as evidenced by the chest X-ray, which shows large bilateral pleural effusions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is likely to worsen due to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload caused by acute renal failure.
2. Volume depletion: The patient may be intravascularly depleted and not mobilizing third space fluid fast enough, as indicated by minimal urine output (UOP) and positive fluid balance.
3. Pleural effusions: The pleural effusions are likely transudates from volume overload. Tapping the effusions may offer little benefit as they are likely to re-accumulate.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are stable but the BUN has increased, indicating possible intravascular volume depletion.
5. Diabetes mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes and requires ongoing management with insulin.
6. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may contribute"

   24 Hour Events:
   - tried PMV this AM --> HR went up and started desaturating
   - Day#18 of 21 of cefepime and inhaled tobra for Klebsiella and
   Pseudamonas in sputum
   - Desatted into mid 80s when turned on side, so RT turned him on to AC
   Vt450, RR10, PEEP8, FiO2 50%-- RT and nurse suctioned him out at that
   time... and turn back to PS 10/5 after a few hours;
   - UOP started to drop off 2300 (10-15cc/hr)--> tried 250cc bolus NS -->
   urine output picked up

   Chest X-Ray ([**11-5**]): unchanged large bilateral pleural effusions, L>R
   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**8-29**] but feels tired.  Based on CXR, patient is highly
   fluid overloaded in lungs which is likely compromising his respiratory
   status; but currently having difficulty diuresing him to make progress
   decreasing his pleural effusions
   - Patient having difficulty mobilizing fluid to be able to diurese
   well, will trial 50g albumin to build up his intravascular volume and
   then restart lasix gtt after a bolus of lasix with a goal urine output
   of 80-100cc/hr.  Will also type and screen the patient as he may
   benefit from a unit of PRBC
s if he is unable to diurese with albumin.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. Hold
   off for now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #18 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean PS down to 5 if patient can tolerate.
   - f/u blood cx from [**10-30**]
NGTD
   - will discuss possibly decreasing volume of tube feeds to help keep
   the patient net negative
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased from 103 to 114; further supporting possible
   intravascular volume depletion.
   - UOP goal of 80-100cc/hr, with reinitiation of lasix gtt with albumin
   to try and mobilize his extravascular volume
   - pm lytes
   - Regarding increasing BUN, as been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - cont to monitor Hct and BUN and guaiac stools
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable
   - get active type and screen
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially with coffee grounds from NGT last
   week
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - place on Passe-Miur Valve on w cuff deflated (Still attached to Vent)
   when family comes once/day to allow him to communicate; if respiratory
   status allows
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   Disposition: ICU pending discontinuation of drip requirements and
   ability to be transferred to pulmonary rehab
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute on chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, anemia, and depression/anxiety. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to fluid overload, difficulty diuresing and mobilizing fluid, re-accumulation of pleural effusions, further deterioration of renal function, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, exacerbation of anemia, and potential worsening of depression/anxiety.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing cefepime and inhaled tobramycin as per ID recommendations, attempting to wean pressure support down to 5 if the patient can tolerate, initiating a trial of 50g albumin to build up intravascular volume followed by restarting lasix gtt with a goal urine output of 80-100cc/hr, typing and screening the patient for potential blood transfusion if needed, and discussing possibly decreasing the volume of tube feeds to help keep the patient net negative.

Please note that this summary is based solely on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   83 yo M w/ prolonged hospital course in setting of severe GS
   pancreatitis.
   Ongoing issues remain:
          Respiratory failure
          ARF/atn on CRI
          PSA/Kleb pna
          Total body volume overload/third spacing
          Depression/anxiety
          Anemia
          Leukocytosis (improving)
          Underlying COPD
   He remains vent dependent (ON PSV) in setting of resolving VAP, ongoing
   volume overload w/ third spacing, pulm edema and effusions on
   underlying significant COPD with chronic CO2 retention.  His abd
   remains distended further impacting his resp status and ability to wean
   from vent.  Primary issue at this time remains ability to mobilize
   fluids to intravascualr space and improve his total body overload.
   Agree with plan to trial albumin with lasix bolus and gtt.  If minimal
   response will given prbc givrn slow drop.  His cr may be at new
   baseline but his bun continuies to rise..  But his BUN continues to
   rise which we suspect is related to itnravscaulr depletion despite
   total body vol overload.  Issue of slow gi bleed remains in ddx given
   bun rise without subsequent  cr bump.  He is heme neg with slow drop in
   hct.  We continue epo, keep t and cross active and note no obvious
   active evidence of gi bleed.    He remains total body vol overloaded
   but intravascularly dry with BUN increasing most likely [**2-26**] diuresis
   and intravascular depletion.  He remains anemic, but without evidence
   of acute bleeding or hct drop. Would hold on additional lasix today and
   allow to re-equilibrate.  Would consider additional fluid bolus with
   albumin. Continue epo.
   From resp status we continue PSV.  He seems to need the small amt of
   PEEP in setting of b/l pleural effusions and persistent abd
   distention.  At this time he does not appear ready for more aggressive
   wean to TC.  Will consider tapping his effusions, though suspect this
   intervention may not have much impact and with his low albumin fluid
   will reaccumulate.  He remains on cefepime and inhaled tobra to
   complete a 18/21 day course for psa/kleb pna.  He remains af now and
   his wbc continue to trend down.
   He continue to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   His mood remains very depressed.  His celexa was recently increased.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe acute pancreatitis who has developed multiple complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still ventilator-dependent due to underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), resolving ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and abdominal distension impacting respiratory status.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF)/acute tubular necrosis (ATN) on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, as indicated by rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and other lab abnormalities.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has an ongoing infection with PSA/Klebsiella pneumonia, for which he is receiving antibiotics.

4. Total body volume overload/third spacing: The patient has fluid overload with third spacing, leading to edema and effusions. This may contribute to his respiratory difficulties and inability to wean from the ventilator.

5. Depression/anxiety: The patient's mood remains very depressed, and his anxiety levels are also high. He is currently being treated with increased doses of celexa.

6. Anemia: The patient is anemic, but there is no evidence of acute bleeding or a significant drop in hemoglobin (Hct) levels.

7. Leukocytosis: Although the patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated, it is improving.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to severe acute pancreatitis. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, resolving pneumonia, total body volume overload, depression/anxiety, anemia, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient remains ventilator-dependent and has ongoing volume overload with third spacing, pulmonary edema, and effusions on underlying significant COPD. The primary issue at this time is mobilizing fluids to the intravascular space to improve total body overload. The plan is to trial albumin with Lasix bolus followed by gtt. If there is minimal response, a packed red blood cell transfusion along with Lasix gtt will be given. The patient's creatinine is likely at a new baseline, while BUN continues to rise, which is suspected to be related to intravascular depletion and diuresis despite total body volume overload. The issue of slow gastrointestinal bleed remains in the differential diagnosis due to the rise in BUN without subsequent creatinine bump, noting prior gastrointestinal bleed in the patient, though this seems much less likely. The patient remains anemic with gradual hematocrit drop, but there is no evidence of acute active gastrointestinal bleed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains a concern due to ongoing volume overload, pulmonary edema, and effusions on underlying significant COPD. There is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume
   overload in setting of renal failure.  Appears to have increased fluid
   in lungs.   Switched to AC yesterday evening.  +1.2L for the day
   yesterday, but -800mL for the first 7hours this AM (still 30L positive
   for length of stay).
   - metolazone and with lasix gtt appeared to work well last night,
   improved urine output picked up to 80-100cc/hr.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. Hold
   off for now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #19 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt Pressure Support [**10-29**] again as diuresed further.
   .
   # Elevated BUN:
   Uremia may have some effect on his mood
   - Ask Renal about CVVH or HD to for uremia and to get some volume off
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased further to 119
   - UOP has averaged 80-100cc/hr after lasix gtt restarted last night
   with albumin to try and mobilize his extravascular volume
   - pm lytes
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - IF urine output drops off, give 1 unit pRBCs for anemia and to give
   colloids intravascularly
   - Consider dialysis or CVVH for uremia and volume overload
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable. BUN continues to rise.
   Consider that patient may have active GI bleed.
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - will transfuse 1 uPRBCs IF his urine output drops off
   - continue to monitor Hct
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - consider changing his room to give him a new environment
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. There is increased fluid in the lungs, and the patient has been switched to assisted controlled ventilation (AC) yesterday evening. The patient has a positive fluid balance of 1.2 liters for the day but negative fluid balance of 800 mL for the first 7 hours this morning, remaining 30 liters positive for the length of stay.

The patient's pleural effusions are likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. It is advised to hold off for now and reassess as needed. The patient continues to receive cefepime and inhaled tobra as per infectious disease recommendations (day #19 of a 21-day course). The patient's underlying COPD should be treated with MDIs including albuterol. 

The patient's elevated BUN may have some effect on his mood. It is recommended to ask the renal team about continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) or hemodialysis (HD) to address uremia and get some volume off. The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure with a stable creatinine level of 2.3 but an increased BUN of 119. The patient's urine output has averaged 80-100 cc/hr after restarting lasix gtt last night with albumin to try and mobilize his extravascular volume. 

Regarding the increasing BUN, the patient has been guaiac positive and has a history of GI bleed in the past, so possibly related to GI bleed. However, the patient's Hct is stable for now, and it is recommended to continue IV PPI. If the patient's urine output drops off, it is advised to give 1 unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) for anemia and to give colloids intravascularly. 

The patient has type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and is on insulin. It is recommended to continue glargine 38u qhs and continue ISS. The patient's anemia is likely due to a history of GI bleed. It is advised to keep an active type and screen, guaiac stools, and transfuse 1 unit of pRBCs if urine output drops off. The patient should continue to monitor Hct, continue EPO, continue IV PPI, and consider changing his room to give him a new environment.

The patient's goals of care include continuing daily physical therapy and trying to get the patient out of bed daily. The patient has a PICC line, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) bundle should be continued. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is unknown."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to klebsiella pneumonia and
   worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure.   On
   pressure support [**10-29**] but switched back to Assist Control in the
   evening.  Based on CXR, patient is highly fluid overloaded in lungs
   which is likely compromising his respiratory status; but currently
   having difficulty diuresing him to make progress decreasing his pleural
   effusions.  +1.2L for the day yesterday, but -800mL for the first
   7hours this AM (still 30L positive for length of stay).
   - Patient having difficulty mobilizing fluid to be able to diurese
   well
had tried albumin to build up his intravascular volume and then
   restarted lasix gtt after which urine output picked up to 80-100cc/hr.
   Will also type and screen the patient as he may benefit from a unit of
   PRBC
s if he is unable to diurese with albumin.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will likely re-accumulate. Hold
   off for now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #19 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt Pressure Support [**10-29**] again as diuresed further.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased further to 119
   - UOP has averaged 80-100cc/hr after lasix gtt restarted last night
   with albumin to try and mobilize his extravascular volume
   - pm lytes
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   .
   # DM
 pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable. BUN continues to rise.
   Consider that patient may have active GI bleed.
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - continue to monitor Hct, especially having recently had coffee
   grounds from NGT
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - place on Passe-Miur Valve on w cuff deflated (Still attached to Vent)
   when family comes once/day to allow him to communicate; if respiratory
   status allows
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to Klebsiella pneumonia and worsened by volume overload in the setting of acute renal failure. The patient's difficulty mobilizing fluid has made it challenging to diurese effectively. The CXR shows that the patient is highly fluid overloaded in the lungs, which is likely compromising his respiratory status. The plan is to continue with assist control ventilation and consider pressure support again once further diuresed.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine level remains stable at around 2.3, indicating a new baseline. The BUN has increased further to 119. The patient's urine output has been averaging 80-100cc/hr after restarting lasix gtt last night with albumin to try and mobilize his extravascular volume.

3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II DM on insulin. It is recommended to continue with glargine 38u qhs and ISS.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed. Hct is stable, but BUN continues to rise. There is a possibility of active GI bleed. It is advised to keep an active type and screen, guaiac stools, monitor"

          Resolving PSA/Kleb pna

          Underlying COPD
   Pt remains vent dependent, now back on ACV.  Although he did not
   desaturate and his o2 requiremetns have not changed, fatigue from b/l
   effusions/volume liekly factoring in.  Will follow vbg on ac and trial
   back on PS.  He is not showing signs of new secretions,f ever or
   inreaing leukocytosis to suggest recurrent vap and we are compelting
   course of
    (ON PSV) in setting of resolving VAP, ongoing volume overload w/ third
   spacing, pulm edema and effusions on underlying significant COPD with
   chronic CO2 retention.  His abd remains distended, though better
   overall, further impacting his resp status and ability to wean from
   vent.  Primary issue at this time remains our need to mobilize fluids
   to intravascular space to improve his total body overload.
   While we are now getting some volume off with lasix gtt at high dose
   and emtolzaone (given albumin), his BUN continues to rise.  Uremnia
   likely further imapcting his MS/affect.  Wll d/w renal team regarding
   moving toward HD trial as BP tolerates.
   Agree with plan
   to trial albumin with lasix bolus then gtt.  If minimal response will
   give prbc transfusion along with lasix gtt.  His cr is likely holding
   at new baseline but his BUN cont to rise, which we suspect is related
   to intravascular depletion and diuresis despite total body vol overload
   noting met alkalosis with elevated serum bicarb.  Issue of slow gi
   bleed remains in ddx given bun rise without subsequent  cr bump noting
   prior GIB in this pt, though this seems much less likely.  He remains
   anemic with gradual hct drop though no evidence of acute active GIB. We
   continue PPI, epo, keeping t and cross active and trending labs.   Will
   give prbc transfusion.
   Will consider tapping his effusions, though suspect this intervention
   may not have much impact and with his low albumin fluid will
   reaccumulate.
   He remains on cefepime and inhaled tobra day 19/21 day course for
   psa/kleb pna.  He remains af now and his wbc has normalized.
   He continues to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   His mood remains very depressed.  His celexa was recently increased.
   Suspect toxic/uremic encphalopthy likely contributing further.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to severe gallstone pancreatitis. He has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure, resolving pneumonia, total body volume overload, depression/anxiety, anemia, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The patient remains ventilator-dependent and is currently on assisted controlled ventilation (ACV). Although he did not desaturate and his oxygen requirements have not changed, fatigue from bilateral effusions and volume overload is likely contributing to his condition. The plan is to follow ventilator weaning guidelines (vbg on ac) and trial back on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The primary issue at this time is the need to mobilize fluids into the intravascular space to improve total body overload. Lasix drip and metolazone with albumin have been initiated to address this, but the patient's BUN continues to rise, suggesting uremia which may further impact his mental status.

The plan is to trial albumin with Lasix bolus followed by gtt. If there is minimal response, a packed red blood cell (prbc) transfusion will be given along with Lasix gtt. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level is likely holding at a new baseline, but his blood urea nitrogen (BUN) continues to rise, possibly related to intravascular depletion and diuresis despite total body volume overload.

   Pt remains vent dependent, now back on ACV.  Although he did not

   from b/l effusions/volume is a factor.  We are now getting some volume
   off with aggressive lasix drip and [**Hospital1 7**] metolazone, bu his BUN continues
   to rise.  We think his cr is likely at new baseline.  His BUN rise is
   likely related to intravascular depletion, continued diuresis despite

   bicarb.  Issue of slow gi bleed remains in ddx given bun rise without

   very gradual in the setting of ongoing phlebotomy, poor renal fx, and
   significant GIB seems much less likely.
   Agree with plan to continue lasix drip + metolazone for now.  If u/o
   tapers off will use colloid/prbc transfusion given slow decline in
   hct.  However, given the slow progress we are making and his
   significant uremia, will d/w renal team regarding moving toward HD for
   clearance and volume removal.    He remains anemic with gradual hct
   drop though no evidence of acute active GIB. In addition to transfusing
   prbcs, we continue PPI, epogen, keeping t and cross active, minimizing
   blood draws as we are able to.
   Will follow vbg while on ACV and trial him back on PS.  There are no
   new secretions from trach sx, and he remains AF without new
   leukocytosis to suggest recurrent vap. He remains on cefepime and
   inhaled tobra day 19/21 for resolving psa/kleb pna. Suspect that volume
   is main factor here in addition to his underlying COPD and abd
   distention.  We have discussed tapping his effusions, and continue to
   consider this, though we suspect they will simply re accumulate and
   that volume removal with HD would be more effective.
   He continues to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   His mood remains very depressed.  His celexa was recently increased.
   Suspect toxic / uremic encephalopathy likely contributing further.
   Will try to best optimize sleep wake schedule.
   Rectal wound
stage 3 decub noted.  Flexi-seal is now out, wound care
   input appreciated, mattress changed as recommended.
   Remainder as per resident note.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with severe gallstone pancreatitis, respiratory failure, and acute renal failure. He has been in the ICU for a prolonged hospital course. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing difficulty weaning off due to bilateral effusions and volume overload. He is also showing signs of intravascular depletion, with rising BUN levels despite diuresis. The patient's creatinine levels are at a new baseline, and there is a concern for ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. His hemoglobin levels have been gradually dropping, but there is no evidence of acute active gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient remains anemic and is receiving packed red blood cells, erythropoietin, and proton pump inhibitor therapy. He is also being considered for hemodialysis to address uremia and volume removal. The patient's mood is depressed, and he is working with a psychiatrist to optimize sleep-wake cycles. He has a stage 3 decubitus ulcer on his rectum, and wound care input is appreciated. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to chronic kidney disease (CKD) if not properly"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in setting of renal failure
   Continues to be on AC mode of ventilation.
   - metolazone and with lasix gtt appeared to work well last night,
   improved urine output picked up to 80-100cc/hr.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hold off for
   now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #20 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt Pressure Support [**10-29**] again as diuresed further.
   .
   # Elevated BUN:
   Uremia may have some effect on his mood
   - Ask Renal about CVVH or HD to for uremia and to get some volume off
   - If this is an option, contact IR for line placement
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased further to 119
   - UOP has averaged 80-100cc/hr after lasix gtt restarted last night
   with albumin to try and mobilize his extravascular volume
   - pm lytes
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - IF urine output drops off, give 1 unit pRBCs for anemia and as
   colloid may help his intravascular space
   - Consider dialysis or CVVH for uremia and volume overload
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable. BUN continues to rise.
   Consider that patient may have active GI bleed.
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - consider changing his room to give him a new environment
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation in AC mode due to respiratory failure. The respiratory failure is likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure.

The patient's urine output has improved to 80-100cc/hr after restarting metolazone and lasix gtt. Pleural effusions are likely transudate from volume overload, and tapping may offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. The patient is being treated with cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recommendations (day #20 of a 21-day course). MDIs including albuterol are being used to treat underlying COPD.

The patient's BUN levels are elevated, which may be due to uremia affecting his mood. Renal consultation has been requested for CVVH or HD to address uremia and to get some volume off. If this is an option, the interventional radiology (IR) team will be contacted for line placement.

The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with a stable creatinine level of 2.2. BUN has increased further to 119. The patient's Hct is stable for now, but he has a history"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
   Respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella pneumonia and volume overload in setting of renal failure
   Continues to be on AC mode of ventilation.  UOP continues to be low
   concerning in the setting of +30 liter LOS fluid balance.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hold off for
   now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #20 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt Pressure Support [**10-29**] again as diuresed further.
   .
   # Elevated BUN:
   Uremia may have some effect on his mood
   - Ask Renal about CVVH or HD to for uremia and to get some volume off
   - If this is an option, contact IR for line placement
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.[**5-27**] be new
   baseline, BUN increased further to 128. Metolazone and with lasix gtt
   had decent response Wednesday night, but UOP continues to decrease; so
   lasix gtt turned off as more fluid was going in than coming out.
   - Consider d/c
ing metolazone today as lasix gtt is not on any more.
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - IF urine output drops off, give 1 unit pRBCs for anemia and as
   colloid may help his intravascular space
   - Consider dialysis or CVVH for uremia and volume overload
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct stable. BUN continues to rise.
   Consider that patient may have active GI bleed.
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21.
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - consider changing his room to give him a new environment
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient remains very apathetic and there is concern that uremia may be contributing to his current mental status. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/44 mmHg to 153/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a mode of AC and has a tracheostomy tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, with slightly elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and decreased pulses in both lower extremities. The patient's respiratory system shows diminished breath sounds throughout and rhonchi. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is purposeful with movement.

The patient's current plan includes continuing cefepime and inhaled tobramycin as per ID recommendations, treating the patient's underlying COPD with MDIs including albuterol, attempting pressure support again as diuresed"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. His renal function is deteriorating with an increasing BUN level of 128 and stable creatinine level. The patient also has diabetes mellitus type II, anemia with a history of GI bleed, and depression/anxiety. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to rely on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The underlying causes include muscular deconditioning, klebsiella pneumonia, and volume overload. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and further deterioration of lung function.
2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by the increasing BUN level of 128. This may lead to fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy such as hemodialysis (HD).
3. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed, which may be contributing to his anemia. There is a risk of further bleeding and the need for blood transfusions.
4. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has well-controlled diabetes but requires continued management with insulin.
5. Depression"

   83 yo M w/ prolonged hospital course in setting of severe GS
   pancreatitis.
   Ongoing issues remain:
          Respiratory failure
          ARF/atn on CRI, uremia, volume overload
          Resolving PSA/Kleb pna
          Depression/anxiety
          Anemia
              Decub-stage 3
          Underlying COPD
   Pt remains vent dependent and back on ACV.  B/l pleural
   effusions/volume overload is the main factor.  His renal fx continues
   to worsen with rising BUN and we have been unable to successfully
   remove adequate volume with attempts at drip diuresis. .His BUN rise is
   likely related to intravascular depletion w/ continued diuresis despite
   total body vol overload noting met alkalosis with elevated serum
   bicarb.  Issue of slow gi bleed remains in ddx given bun rise without
   subsequent cr bump noting prior GIB in this pt.  His hct drop has been
   very gradual in the setting of ongoing phlebotomy, poor renal fx, and
   significant GIB seems much less likely.
   Agree with plan to move forward with HD line placement in IR followed
   by HD and volume removal as his BP tolerates.  A-line placed yesterday
   demonstrates that invasive BP is at least 20 points higher than cuff
   pressures and this will allow for close following of hemodynamics with
   volume shifts.  Will type and cross and transfuse prbcs if needed to
   tolerate HD.  His hct drop has been very gradual in setting of sig
   volume overload with trace heme pos stools and no findings to suggest
   active GIB.  We continue with ppi and epogen.
   Will follow abg and continue ACV.  Volume overload and effusions are
   the main issue, in addition abd distention.  We have discussed tapping
   his effusions, and continue to consider this, though we suspect they
   will simply re accumulate and that volume removal with HD will be more
   effective.As we are able to remove volume, would transition back to
   PSV.  There are no new secretions from trach sx, and he remains AF
   without new leukocytosis to suggest recurrent vap. He remains on
   cefepime and inhaled tobra day 20/21 for resolving psa/kleb pna.
   He continues to work with PT.
   His mood remains very depressed.  He is on celexa. Will try to optimize
   his sleep wake schedule.Though he is very alert, there may be component
   of  toxic / uremic encephalopathy effecting his mood.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to severe gallstone pancreatitis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), and is on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI). There is also a resolving pseudomonas Klebsiella pneumonia, depression/anxiety, anemia, and a stage 3 decubitus ulcer.

The main issues currently affecting the patient include respiratory failure, ARF, volume overload, and ongoing pleural effusions. The patient's renal function continues to worsen, as indicated by the rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The cause of the elevated BUN may be related to intravascular depletion and ongoing diuresis despite total body volume overload. The presence of metabolic alkalosis with elevated serum bicarbonate further supports this.

Another consideration in the differential diagnosis is the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), given the rise in BUN without a subsequent increase in creatinine. However, the gradual drop in hematocrit (hct) suggests that significant GIB seems less likely.

To address these concerns, the plan moving forward includes the placement of a hemodialysis (HD) line in interventional radiology (IR) followed by HD and volume removal as tolerated by the patient's blood pressure. This will help manage the volume overload and associated complications.

Additionally, the patient will continue with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and ery"

          Anemia
          Underlying COPD
   Pt remains vent dependent, and back on ACV.  B/l effusions/volume is
   the main factor.  His renal fx is worse and his BUN continues to rise
   with gtt/diuresis.
   We are now getting some volume off with aggressive lasix drip and [**Hospital1 7**]
   metolazone, bu his BUN continues to rise.  We think his cr is likely at
   new baseline.  His BUN rise is likely related to intravascular
   depletion, continued diuresis despite total body vol overload noting
   met alkalosis with elevated serum bicarb.  Issue of slow gi bleed
   remains in ddx given bun rise without subsequent cr bump noting prior
   GIB in this pt.  His hct drop has been very gradual in the setting of
   ongoing phlebotomy, poor renal fx, and significant GIB seems much less
   likely.
   Agree with plan to move forward with HD line placmeent in IR and HD as
   his BP tolerates.  A-line palced yesterday demosntrates invasive BPs
   are signifcantly higher than cuff presures.  Will give I unit prbcs if
   needed to tolerate HD.  His hct drop has been very gradual in setting
   of sig volume overload with trrace heme pos stools and no fidnigns to
   sugegst actue active GIB.  Will keep active [**Last Name (un) 10753**] and cross and continue
   ppi and epogen.
    If u/o tapers off will use colloid/prbc transfusion given slow decline
   in hct.  However, given the slow progress we are making and his
   significant uremia, will d/w renal team regarding moving toward HD for
   clearance and volume removal.    He remains anemic with gradual hct
   drop though no evidence of acute active GIB. In addition to transfusing
   prbcs, we continue PPI, epogen, keeping t and cross active, minimizing
   blood draws as we are able to.
   Will follow vbg while on ACV.  If  we are able to get fluid off will
   trial back on PS as able.  There are no new secretions from trach sx,
   and he remains AF without new leukocytosis to suggest recurrent vap. He
   remains on cefepime and inhaled tobra day 20/21 for resolving psa/kleb
   pna. Suspect that volume is main factor here in addition to his
   underlying COPD and abd distention.  We have discussed tapping his
   effusions, and continue to consider this, though we suspect they will
   simply re accumulate and that volume removal with HD would be more
   effective.
   He continues to work with PT and is getting OOB to chair.
   His mood remains very depressed.  His celexa was recently increased.
   Suspect toxic / uremic encephalopathy likely contributing further.
   Will try to best optimize sleep wake schedule.

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a prolonged hospital course due to severe gallstone pancreatitis, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. The patient remains dependent on the ventilator and is back on assisted controlled ventilation (ACV). The main issues include respiratory failure, ARF/atn on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRI), resolving PSA/Klebsiella pneumonia, total body volume overload/third spacing, depression/anxiety, anemia, and underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's dependence on the ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory distress. There is a risk of further deterioration and potential need for tracheostomy or prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute kidney injury (ARF)/acute tubular necrosis (ATN): The patient's worsening renal function and rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels suggest ongoing kidney damage. There is a risk of further deterioration in renal function, leading to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease.
3. Infection: Although the patient has resolving PSA/Klebsiella pneumonia, there is still a risk of new infections due to the immunocompromised state caused by critical illness and prolonged hospitalization.
4. Volume overload/third spacing: The patient's significant volume overload and third spacing can lead to complications such as heart failure, pulmonary edema, or worsening renal function.
5. Anemia: The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 600 cc off yesterday .Transitioned from AC
   mode to PS ventilation.
   - HD planned again for today to decrease fluid overload and help with
   vent weaning
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hold off for
   now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #21 of 21 day
   course)
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.2; may be
   new baseline, BUN decreased from 128 to 107 today after one session of
   HD. UOP about 40 cc/hr. Mental status intact.
   -- Continue HD as scheduled
   - Consider d/c
ing metolazone today as lasix gtt is not on any more.
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - If patient becomes hypotensive during HD, consider midodrine
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct increased appropriately after 1 unit
   of PRBC
s yesterday. Stools trace guaiac positive [**2153-11-8**].
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - consider changing his room to give him a new environment
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

   Disposition :ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. The plan is to continue with mechanical ventilation and attempt to wean down as much as possible.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure with a stable creatinine level of 2.2. The plan is to continue with scheduled hemodialysis (HD) and consider discontinuing metolazone if the patient is no longer receiving lasix.

3. Diabetes Mellitus (DM): The patient has well-controlled type II DM on insulin. The plan is to continue with glargine 38u qhs and ISS.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed and increased Hct after receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. The plan is to keep an active type and screen, monitor guaiac-positive stools, and consider transfusing more PRBCs if the patient becomes hypotensive during HD.

5. Depression/Anxiety: The patient has depression/anxiety, and the plan is to continue citalopram 40mg and encourage mental stimulation"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Pt. for new HD line in IR today then for HD to help take volume off,
   may need midodrine to help his BP tolerate HD
   - I/O negative over the past 24 hours, but misleading since tube feeds
   were discontinued
   - today is day #19/21 of cefepime and tobramycin for VAP
   - Renal says: making good urine, don't need a lot of HD. will do
   intermittently throughout the weekend; trying to take off [**1-26**] kg each

   Disposition :ICU
","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving dialysis, antibiotics, and other supportive treatments.

Based on the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of respiratory failure secondary to muscular deconditioning, pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. The plan is to continue weaning off the ventilator and provide supportive care.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has stable creatinine levels, indicating a possible new baseline. The BUN has decreased after one session of hemodialysis (HD). The plan is to continue HD as scheduled and consider discontinuing metolazone if the Lasix gtt is not needed anymore.

3. Diabetes Mellitus: The patient has type II diabetes which is well-controlled on insulin. The plan is to continue with glargine 38u qhs and ISS doses while NPO.

4. Anemia: The patient has a history of GI bleed and an increased Hct after receiving 1 unit of PRBCs yesterday. The plan is to keep an active type and screen, guaiac stools, and transfuse more PRBCs if the patient becomes hypotensive during HD.

5. Depression/Anxiety: The patient is currently on citalopram 40mg"

   Assessment and Plan
 Respiratory failure
   - likely ongoing due to volume overload and weakness/deconditioning
   - volume removal with HD as tolerated
   - continue to trial PS intermittently
   - finishing tobra/cefepime today for pneumonia (total 21 day course)
   - continue MDIs for h/o COPD, no evidence of bronchoconstriction on
   vent/exam
 Renal Failure
   - making some urine, getting HD for uremia and additional volume
   removal
   - on metolazone, which can be discontinued until back on lasix
   - electrolytes stable
 Anemia
   - likely slow GI ooze, will transfuse for crit <21
   - no obvious active bleeding

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male admitted with pancreatitis, now experiencing ongoing respiratory failure, volume overload, renal failure, and anemia. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including pancreatitis, respiratory failure, renal failure, and anemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure due to ongoing volume overload and weakness/deconditioning, ongoing renal failure requiring hemodialysis for uremia and additional volume removal, and the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, adjust fluid management accordingly, and continue with ongoing renal support. Additionally, the patient's anemia should be managed by transfusing when the hemoglobin level drops below 21."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a chief complaint of pancreatitis and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has ongoing respiratory failure, volume overload, renal failure, and anemia. 

From the vital signs, the patient's temperature is within normal range, but there are concerns about low blood pressure (104/49 mmHg) and heart rate (76 bpm). The respiratory rate is normal at 18 breaths per minute, and the patient's oxygen saturation is at 100%. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows borderline low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) overnight. Fluid balance indicates a total intake of 2,512 mL and total output of 2,042 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and dialysis. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube with a tidal volume set at 450 mL. The respiratory support mode is CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, with a respiratory system resistance compensation (RSBC) of 104. The plateau pressure is 29 cmH2O, and the compliance is 23 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160.

","The patient is an 83-year-old male who was initially admitted with pancreatitis and is now experiencing ongoing respiratory failure. The patient has undergone tracheostomy, volume overload, and renal failure. 

24-hour events include dialysis yesterday with borderline low mean arterial pressures (MAPs) overnight. A trial of partial spontaneous (PS) ventilation failed overnight with low tidal volumes. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure of 104/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 88.6 kg at admission to 96.9 kg currently. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,512 mL and a total output of 2,042 mL since midnight. The patient is receiving IV fluids, blood products, and nutrition through a nasogastric (NG) tube. 

Respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode on the ventilator. The set tidal volume (Vt) is 450 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 24 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 29 cmH2O, and compliance is 23 cmH2O/mL.

   24 Hour Events:
   HD today: took off 800 cc; Per renal: will not do HD until Mon.
   - Gave 100 mg lasix + 5 mg metolazone at. UOP was minimal ~ 20 cc/hr. K
   low 3.3; only gave 20 b/c on HD. gave 4 mg bumex and UOP:  did not
   increase
   - Changed from AC to PS around 1300. Was initially on PS 18/5 prior to
   HD, but had lower tidal volumes during this time so switched to AC
   until 1300. Tolerating 18/5 PS fine. ABG 7.38/59/80 now at 15/5
   - d/c'd cefepime; tobra day 16/21. started [**10-27**]. [**11-16**] last dose.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off.Transitioned from AC mode during
   HD to PS ventilation.
   - HD planned again for Monday, with midodrine
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**]
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex.
   - Continue HD as scheduled but add midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - D/C lasix and metolazone, since his UOP is not responding
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct increased appropriately after 1 unit
   of PRBC
s. Stools trace guaiac positive [**2153-11-8**].
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - transition to po PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - psych consult tomorrow to address other pharmaceutical interventions
   (ie a stimulant) to help with his mood and also to discuss whether he
   has capacity to make decisions about his goals of care, especially code
   status
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, Klebsiella/Pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, well-controlled diabetes mellitus, anemia, and depression/anxiety. The patient's goals of care include daily physical therapy and getting him out of bed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely due to several factors including muscular deconditioning, pneumonia, and volume overload. There is a risk of further deterioration if not managed appropriately.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of sepsis, which can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring and prompt treatment are necessary to prevent recurrence.
3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has worsening renal function despite hemodialysis (HD). Insufficient urine output and non-responsiveness to diuretics indicate potential complications such as acute kidney injury or further deterioration in renal function.
4. Pleural effusions: The patient has pleural effusions likely secondary to volume overload. These effusions may lead to respiratory compromise if they accumulate and compress the lungs.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   HD today: took off 800 cc; Per renal: will not do HD until Mon.
   - Gave 100 mg lasix + 5 mg metolazone at. UOP was minimal ~ 20 cc/hr. K
   low 3.3; only gave 20 b/c on HD. gave 4 mg bumex and UOP:  did not
   increase
   - Changed from AC to PS around 1300. Was initially on PS 18/5 prior to
   HD, but had lower tidal volumes during this time so switched to AC
   until 1300. Tolerating 18/5 PS fine. ABG 7.38/59/80 now at 15/5: ABG:
   - d/c'd cefepime; tobra day 16/21. started [**10-27**]. [**11-16**] last dose.
   - pt became agitated, hypertensive and c/o respiratory distress with
   turning and cleaning, so he was transiently placed on A/C for more
   support this morning and then changed back to PSV

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 600 cc off yesterday .Transitioned from AC
   mode to PS ventilation.
   - HD planned again for today to decrease fluid overload and help with
   vent weaning
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hold off for
   now and re-assess as needed.
   - Continue cefepime and inhaled tobra as per ID recs (day #21 of 21 day
   course)  stop tomorrow.
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 Essentially stable Cr 2.2; may be
   new baseline, BUN decreased from 128 to 107 today after one session of
   HD. UOP about 40 cc/hr. Mental status intact.
   -- Continue HD as scheduled
   - Consider d/c
ing metolazone today as lasix gtt is not on any more.
   - Regarding increasing BUN, has been guaiac positive and has hx of GI
   bleed in past, so possibly related to GI bleed, but Hct stable for now,
   will continue IV PPI
   - If patient becomes hypotensive during HD, consider midodrine
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct increased appropriately after 1 unit
   of PRBC
s yesterday. Stools trace guaiac positive [**2153-11-8**].
   - keep active type and screen , guaiac stools
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - continue IV PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - consider changing his room to give him a new environment
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and try to get pt out of bed daily
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU for ongoing management of his conditions. 

The patient has been on dialysis but had it taken off yesterday. He will not undergo dialysis until Monday. Despite this, his BUN has decreased from 128 to 107 today after one session of dialysis. His creatinine levels are stable at 2.2. 

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. He is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode and will continue to be monitored closely. 

The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and will be treated with MDIs including albuterol. 

His mental status remains intact. 

The patient has a history of gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and is currently guaiac positive with trace amounts of blood in his stools. He will continue to receive intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. 

His hemoglobin (Hct) levels have increased appropriately after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. He will continue to be monitored for any signs of hypotension or low Hct and may require further transfusion. 

The patient's diabetes mellitus (DM) is well-controlled"

   Assessment and Plan
 Respiratory Failure
   - likely combination of weakness/deconditioning and volume overload
   - continue volume removal with HD
   - s/p 21days of cefepime, 21 days of tobra to end 10.23
   - continue to trial PS and PMV trials
 Renal
   - plan HD tomorrow
   - will start midodrine tomorrow morning, 10mg, prior to HD
   - if BP improved with midodrine, then can pull a-line
   - will cycle NIBP during HD and see if a-line necessary
   - will stop the diuretics as his urine output has not responded
   - had some oozing from his HD line, now improved
 Depression
   - will consult psych in the morning about ? ritalin or other stimulant
   - no real improvement on the celexa, but still early in the course
   - will need full assessment of capacity prior to any GOC discussions
 Goals of care
   - patient remains full code, but has spontaneously asked us to stop
   therapy multiple in the past
   - assessment of patient's goals is complicated by his depression, but
   will get psych involved tomorrow
   - if able to be on HD regularly without a-line then can transfer to
   rehab
 Anemia
   - stable, likely due to slow GI losses and maybe oozing from wound

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off on Saturday (and 600cc on
   Friday).  Has remained on PS 15/5 ventilation for 24hrs.
   - HD planned again for today with midodrine
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after
   HD.  Had another lasix trial of 80mg IV this AM, to which he did not
   respond well.
   - Continue HD as scheduled but add midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - likely HD schedule : Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Most recently guaiac negative.  Getting
   HD for increased BUN.
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - transition to po PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - psych consult to address possible use of stimulant to help with mood
   and also to discuss whether he has capacity to make decisions about his
   goals of care, especially code status
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   - psych consult to establish capacity to make decisions
   - once he is stable on an HD schedule, will transfer to pulm rehab on
   HD-->f/u with renal about HD today
   # Sacral Decub:
   Flexi seal had been pulled, and wound care is improving the
   ulcer
healing.
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated for several medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. The patient is on mechanical ventilation (PS 15/5) and has had a chest X-ray showing clear anterior chest with diminished bases laterally. Pleural effusions are also present, which are likely transudate from volume overload. The plan is to continue with inhaled tobramycin and attempt to wean down the ventilator as much as possible. The patient may also require NIF (negative inspiratory force) assessment to differentiate between muscle weakness and volume status contributing to his respiratory status.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, as evidenced by elevated BUN and creatinine levels. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and is responding suboptimally to lasix boluses or gtt. Another lasix trial of 80mg IV was given this morning without much response. The plan is to continue HD as scheduled and add midodrine to help with blood pressure and facilitate extra volume off during HD.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off.Transitioned from AC mode during
   HD to PS ventilation.
   - HD planned again for Monday or Tuesday, with midodrine
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**]
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex.
   - Continue HD as scheduled but add midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - D/C lasix and metolazone, since his UOP is not responding
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Hct increased appropriately after 1 unit
   of PRBC
s. Stools trace guaiac positive [**2153-11-8**].
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - transition to po PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and encouragement
   - psych consult tomorrow to address other pharmaceutical interventions
   (ie a stimulant) to help with his mood and also to discuss whether he
   has capacity to make decisions about his goals of care, especially code
   status
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   - will consult psych in the morning for help with medication
   management, specificially would he benefit from adding a stimulant, and
   to address capacity to make decisions about goals of care, as we would
   like to readdress code status prior to transfer to pulm rehab
   - once he is stable on an HD schedule, will transfer to pulm rehab on
   HD-->f/u with renal about HD today
   # Sacral Decub:
   - flexi seal pulled
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure.
2. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia.
3. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 171/69 mmHg to 102/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
4. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including antibiotics (Cefipime and Erythromycin), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis).
5. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels.
6. The patient has pleural effusions, which are likely transudate due to volume overload. Tapping may not offer significant benefit as it will re-accumulate.
7. The patient's underlying COPD needs to be treated with MDIs, including albuterol.
8. The patient is being weaned down from the ventilator gradually, but still experiences periods of desaturation and shortness of breath.
9. The patient's urine output is suboptimal and has not"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - took off 1.7L w HD today ; tolerated well for first 1.5hrs, then
   started gasping for air -- very uncomfortable, RR 30s, so was switched
   back to AC, still somewhat uncomfortable but better... ABG about 15 min
   after switching to AC and looked great.  Pt likely having panic attacks
   - F/U psych consult recs--> DC citalopram and ambien b/c Pt may be in
   Hypoactive Delirium; may use Haldol 0.5mg PRN agitation [**Name (NI) **]
   - pt got 0.5mg haldol tonight and slept very well, but SBP dropped into
   80s (MAP 57) then into 60s systolic (MAPs upper 40s)-- when wake him
   up, SBPs into the 100s, but concerned about hypoperfusion in SBPs 60s,
   gave 250ccs IVF... considered vasopressin just while sleeping, but will
   hold off for now

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off on Saturday (and 600cc on
   Friday). 1.7 liters yesterday.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - Will sit patient up after HD and and attempt PS trial.
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   Hypotension: Patient with brief episodes of low BP in sleep. Possibly
   related to large fluid removal today in HD. Concern for hypoperfusion.
   Was given some fluid. When woken up, BP increased appropriately.
   Difficult to assess mental status/UOP as both are compromised.
   - Consider adding vasopressin during sleep, if BP MAPS dip into the mid
   50s.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Patient still with A-line
.atempt to correlate cuff pressure and A
   line consistently, and once this is performed, pull A-line as patient
   cannot have an a-line in rehab.
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after
   HD.
   - Continue HD as scheduled continue midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - likely HD schedule : Tues, Thurs, Saturday
   .
   # DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u [**Month/Year (2) 7873**]
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   .
   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Most recently guaiac negative.  Getting
   HD for increased BUN.
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - po PPI
   .
   # Depression/anxiety:  Psych concerned for hypoactive delirium
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and d/c all  benzos
   - Low dose Haldol [**Month/Year (2) 7873**] prn; monitor QTc if patient gets a lot of haldol.
   - psych following and appreciate recs
   .
   # Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   - psych consult pending to establish capacity to make decisions;
   difficult in setting of delirium
   - once he is stable on an HD schedule, will transfer to pulm rehab on
   HD-->f/u with renal about HD today
   # Sacral Decub:
   Flexi seal had been pulled, and wound care is improving the
   ulcer
healing.
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient has been receiving hemodialysis (HD) and has had a significant fluid removal over the past day, leading to episodes of hypotension. His blood pressure is currently being managed with IV fluids and midodrine. The patient also has underlying COPD and is being treated with inhaled tobramycin and cefepime. He is showing signs of hypoactive delirium and is being treated with citalopram and haloperidol. The patient's anemia is due to a history of GI bleed, and he is being monitored closely for any changes in hemoglobin levels. The patient's goals of care include daily physical therapy, psych consult for capacity to make decisions, and transfer to pulmonary rehab once stable on HD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. There is a concern for recurrent pleural effusions, which may be transudative due to volume overload. Tapping the effusions may offer little benefit as they tend to re-accumulate. Continued volume removal through HD is planned to improve respiratory status.

2. Hypotension: The patient has experienced"

   - took off 1.7L w HD today ; tolerated well for first 1.5hrs, then
   started gasping for air -- very uncomfortable, RR 30s, so was switched
   back to AC, still somewhat uncomfortable but better... ABG about 15 min
   after switching to AC and looked great.  Pt likely having panic attacks
   - F/U psych consult recs--> DC citalopram and ambien b/c Pt may be in
   Hypoactive Delirium; may use Haldol 0.5mg PRN agitation [**Name (NI) **]
   - pt got 0.5mg haldol tonight and slept very well, but SBP dropped into
   80s (MAP 57) then into 60s systolic (MAPs upper 40s)-- when wake him
   up, SBPs into the 100s, but concerned about hypoperfusion in SBPs 60s,
   gave 250ccs IVF... considered vasopressin just while sleeping, but will

   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off on Saturday (and 600cc on
   Friday).  Has remained on PS 15/5 ventilation for 24hrs.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   Hypotension: Patient with brief episodes of low BP in sleep. Possibly
   related to large fluid removal today in HD. Concern for hypoperfusion.
   Was given some fluid. When woken up, BP increased appropriately.
   Difficult to assess mental status/UOP as both are compromised.
   - Consider adding vasopressin during sleep, if BP MAPS dip into the mid

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for 24 hours and is receiving hemodialysis (HD) three times a week. The patient's recent events include taking off 1.7 liters of fluid during HD, which was tolerated well initially but then led to discomfort and gasping for air. The patient was switched back to assisted control ventilation (AC), and his arterial blood gas (ABG) looked good. The patient is likely experiencing panic attacks, and a psychiatric consultation is planned to address this issue.

The patient has been started on inhaled tobramycin, which will be continued until November 16th, and the course of cefepime has been finished. The underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) needs to be treated with medication and attempts will be made to wean the patient off the ventilator as much as possible. The patient still experiences periods of desaturation when turned or during times of increased anxiety.

The patient has episodes of low blood pressure, possibly related to large fluid removal during HD. This could be a concern for hypoperfusion. The patient was given some fluids when his blood pressure dropped, and it appropriately increased. There are plans to readdress the patient's code status before transferring him to ventilator weaning rehabilitation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   > Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off on Saturday (and 600cc on
   Friday).  Has remained on PS 15/5 ventilation for 24hrs.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished for GNR pneumonia
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   Hypotension: Patient with brief episodes of low BP in sleep. Possibly
   related to large fluid removal today in HD. Concern for hypoperfusion.
   Was given some fluid. When woken up, BP increased appropriately.
   Difficult to assess mental status/UOP as both are compromised.
   - Consider adding vasopressin during sleep, if BP MAPS dip into the mid
   50s.
   - Continue to monitor,correlate NIBP and Art lines and remove arterial
   line.
   > Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after
   HD.
   - Continue HD as scheduled continue midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - daily HD for now.
   > DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   > Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Most recently guaiac negative.  Getting
   HD for increased BUN.
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - po PPI
   > Depression/anxiety:  Psych concerned for delirium
   - D/C citalopram 40mg and any benzos
   - Low dose Haldol qhs prn
   - psych following and appreciate recs
   > Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   - psych consult : hypoactive delirium
   - once he is stable on an HD schedule, will transfer to pulm rehab on
   HD-->f/u with renal about HD today
   # Sacral Decub:
   Flexi seal had been pulled, and wound care is improving the

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has respiratory failure secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. Pleural effusions are likely transudates from volume overload. Tapping will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully, respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced brief episodes of low blood pressure in sleep, possibly related to large fluid removal during hemodialysis. This could be a concern for hypoperfusion. The patient was given some fluid, and when awakened, blood pressure increased appropriately. Vasopressin may be considered during sleep if blood pressure dips into the mid-50s.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's BUN and creatinine improved on hemodialysis, but the patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after hemodialysis. Hemodialysis should continue as scheduled, and midodrine may be used to help with blood pressure and facilitate extra volume removal during hemodialysis.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to muscular deconditioning, pneumonia, and volume overload. Continuous monitoring and management of his respiratory status is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Pleural Effusions: The patient has pleural effusions likely secondary to volume overload. Tapping may offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Close monitoring and continued volume removal are necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient had brief episodes of low blood pressure during sleep, possibly related to large fluid removal during hemodialysis. This could lead to hypoperfusion. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are required.
4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's B"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 9611**] is an 83M with pancreatitis, with respiratory failure, sepsis,
   and improving renal failure.
   > Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD took off 800 cc off on Saturday (and 600cc on
   Friday).  Has remained on PS 15/5 ventilation for 24hrs.
   - Pleural effusions likely transudate from volume overload. Tapping
   will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully
   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished for GNR pneumonia
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   Hypotension: Patient with brief episodes of low BP in sleep. Possibly
   related to large fluid removal today in HD. Concern for hypoperfusion.
   Was given some fluid. When woken up, BP increased appropriately.
   Difficult to assess mental status/UOP as both are compromised.
   - Consider adding vasopressin during sleep, if BP MAPS dip into the mid
   50s.
   - Continue to monitor,correlate NIBP and Art lines and remove arterial
   line.
   > Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after
   HD.
   - Continue HD as scheduled continue midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - daily HD for now.
   > DM
 Well controlled. Pt has type II DM on insulin
   - continue glargine 38u qhs
   - continue ISS
   -
 dose while NPO
   > Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Most recently guaiac negative.  Getting
   HD for increased BUN.
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO
   - po PPI
   > Depression/anxiety:  Psych concerned for delirium
   - D/C citalopram 40mg and any benzos
   - Low dose Haldol qhs prn
   - psych following and appreciate recs
   > Goals of care:
   - continue daily Physical therapy and get pt out of bed daily
   - psych consult : hypoactive delirium
   - once he is stable on an HD schedule, will transfer to pulm rehab on
   HD-->f/u with renal about HD today
   # Sacral Decub:
   Flexi seal had been pulled, and wound care is improving the
   ulcer
healing.
   - wound care following; follow up on recs
   - frequent turning

","Summary:
Mr. [Known Lastname] is an 83-year-old male patient with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU and is on mechanical ventilation with PS 15/5 settings. The patient has pleural effusions likely due to volume overload, which is a result of his respiratory failure. The effusions are expected to re-accumulate if tapped. The patient's underlying COPD needs to be treated with MDIs including albuterol. The goal is to wean down the ventilator as much as possible, but the patient still experiences periods of desaturation during changes in position and shortness of breath during times of increased anxiety. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) will be attempted again when the patient is in a chair for better effort. The patient's code status will be addressed prior to transfer to vent rehab.

The patient also has hypotension, which may be related to large fluid removal during hemodialysis (HD). There is concern for hypoperfusion, and the patient has been given some fluid. When awakened, the patient's blood pressure increased appropriately. Vasopressin may be considered during sleep if the blood pressure dips into the mid-50s. The arterial line should be removed, and close monitoring of blood pressure and fluid balance is necessary.

The patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, with both BUN and creatinine improving on HD"

   respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Attempt to wean down vent as much as possible, patient still having
   some periods of desaturation with turning, also c/o shortness of breath
   during times of increased anxiety
   - Will sit patient up after HD and and attempt PS trial.
   - try NIF again when out of bed in chair for possible better effort
   - will readdress code status with patient and family prior to transfer
   to vent rehab
   .
   Hypotension: Patient with brief episodes of low BP in sleep. Possibly
   related to large fluid removal today in HD. Concern for hypoperfusion.
   Was given some fluid. When woken up, BP increased appropriately.
   Difficult to assess mental status/UOP as both are compromised.
   - Consider adding vasopressin during sleep, if BP MAPS dip into the mid
   50s.
   - Continue to monitor
   - Patient still with A-line
.atempt to correlate cuff pressure and A
   line consistently, and once this is performed, pull A-line as patient
   cannot have an a-line in rehab.

   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt, also did not respond to bumex after
   HD.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. Pleural effusions are also present and are likely transudate due to volume overload. Tapping will likely offer little benefit as it will re-accumulate. Hopefully, the patient's respiratory status will improve with continued volume removal.

2. Hypotension: The patient experienced brief episodes of low blood pressure during sleep. This could be related to large fluid removal during hemodialysis. There is concern for hypoperfusion, and the patient was given some fluid. The blood pressure increased appropriately when the patient was awakened. The possibility of adding vasopressin during sleep if blood pressure drops into the mid-50s is being considered.

3. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's BUN and creatinine levels improved on hemodialysis (HD), but the patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not responded to lasix boluses or gentamicin. It is recommended to continue with scheduled HD and midodrine to help with blood pressure control and facilitate extra volume removal during HD. The likely HD schedule is Tuesday"

- The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and improving renal failure.
- He is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various treatments and interventions.
- The patient's current vitals include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112-155/49-73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- Physical examination reveals clear anterior chest with diminished bases laterally, regular rate and rhythm, distended but slightly softer abdomen, 3+ lower extremity pitting edema, and a sacral decubitus ulcer stage III.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and potassium levels, as well as abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure.

   # Respiratory failure
 likely secondary to muscular deconditioning,
   klebsiella/psuedomonus pneumonia and volume overload in setting of
   renal failure . HD appears to be improving respiratory status
   - Pleural effusion improvement after fluid taken off yesterday
   - Continue inhaled tobramycin, was started on [**10-27**], so last day will be
   [**11-16**] ; cefepime course finished
   - treat pt
s underlying COPD with MDIs, incl albuterol
   - Pt tolerated passe-miur valve yesterday doing well without knowing
   that he is on valve; Tolerated PS 5/5 as well
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure
 BUN and creatinine both improved on
   HD, patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been
   responding to lasix boluses or gtt.
   - Continue HD as scheduled continue midodrine to help with BP
s and
   facilitate extra volume off during HD
   - Will d/w Renal switching HD schedule to M/W/F from Tues, Thurs,
   Saturday
   - Question of whether patient needs midodrine on HD days as patient has
   been hypertensive lately
this should be followed closely

   # Anemia
   Hx of GI bleed.  Most recently guaiac negative.  Getting
   HD for increased BUN, which has improved significantly.
   - keep active type and screen
   - If patient becomes hypotensive while in HD; consider transfusing more
   prbc
s regardless of Hct.
   - continue to monitor Hct; transfuse for Hct < 21
   - continue EPO

   # Depression/anxiety:  Psych concerned for hypoactive delirium
   - Continue citalopram 40mg and d/c all  benzos
   - Low dose Haldol qhs prn insomnia/agitation; monitor QTc if patient
   gets a lot of haldol.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a medical history of pancreatitis, respiratory failure, sepsis, and renal failure. The patient's current conditions include muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, volume overload in the setting of renal failure, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions and treatment plan include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure likely secondary to muscular deconditioning, klebsiella/pseudomonas pneumonia, and volume overload in the setting of renal failure. The patient is currently on inhaled tobramycin and cefepime, but there is a concern about potential antibiotic resistance due to the presence of klebsiella/pseudomonas infection. This may require further evaluation and adjustment of the antibiotic treatment plan.

2. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and both BUN and creatinine have improved on hemodialysis (HD). However, the patient continues with suboptimal urine output and has not been responding to lasix boluses or gtt. The patient will continue with scheduled HD and midodrine to help with blood pressure management and facilitate extra volume removal during HD. There is a question about whether the patient needs midodrine on HD days, as the patient has been hypertensive lately. Close monitoring of blood"
