   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a medical history of COPD, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Key points from the note include:
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate.
- The patient's oxygen saturation is within normal range, but there are concerns about potential complications due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's chest CT shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism or new infection, but he has chronic bronchiectasis and resolving necrotic pneumonia.
- The patient's recent thalamic hemorrhage is stable, with no evidence of new bleeding on the head CT.
- The patient has a history of COPD, cirrhosis, opiate addiction, and is currently receiving appropriate treatments for these conditions.
- The patient is critically ill and has been discussed during interdisciplinary rounds.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring and appropriate infection control measures should be taken.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness can increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as boots and early ambulation should be implemented.
3. Pressure ulcers: Prol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and current respiratory failure. The patient is in the ICU and has several medical conditions and complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has respiratory failure and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) at 10/5. A chest CT has been done, which shows no evidence of new infection but reveals chronic bronchiectasis and resolving necrotic pneumonia. The plan is to continue with standing albuterol/atrovent nebulizers and mucinex, wean off the ventilator, and await culture data to determine if treatment for stenotrophomonas is necessary.

2. S/p Thalamic Hemorrhage: The patient had a thalamic hemorrhage, but a recent CT head showed no evidence of new bleed. Neurology is following up on this condition.

3. COPD: The patient has a history of COPD and will continue to receive albuterol/atrovent nebulizers as part of his treatment plan.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis, and Lasix will be restarted once he returns to the healthcare facility.

5. Opiate Addiction: The patient has a history of opiate addiction, and methadone is being held due to altered mental status.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, stroke, respiratory failure, ventricular tachycardia, and HCV cirrhosis. He presents with hypoxic respiratory failure and has been diagnosed with a right middle lobe artery pulmonary embolus. The patient also has chronic infections with fungal organisms, including Nocardia and Aspergillus fumigatus. 

The patient's current condition is stable, with oxygenation and HD stable. The plan includes attempting to wean down FiO2 as tolerated and repeating ABG. A repeat CTA chest will be placed to reassess the pulmonary embolus, and if unable to obtain PIV, a power PICC will be placed. An IVC filter is another possible therapeutic option if the patient has a PE. Further abx will be held, and ID consultation will be sought to determine if treating Aspergillus fumigatus and Nocardia would be indicated. Sputum cx for GS and culture and fungal cx will be sent, along with beta glucan and galactomannan. Neurology and neurosurgical consults will be obtained to determine when AC would be feasible. 

The patient recently suffered a right thalamic hemorrhagic CVA. A non-contrast CT head will be ordered to assess the evolution of the bleed if plans for anticoagulation proceed. 

The patient's DNR status was discussed with the family, and they are hesitant to pursue invasive procedures or extreme measures. The patient's code status is DNR."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of hep C, COPD, bronchiectasis, and recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was admitted from rehab with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is hypoxia. He has been able to wean off the ventilator to a trach collar and has started on treatment for stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas infections. The patient has a right thalamic hematoma, which is showing expected evolution on CT scan. He is experiencing back pain, which has been alleviated by methadone, and continues to have increased secretions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's primary concern is hypoxia, which could lead to further respiratory distress and potentially ventilator dependence.
2. Infection: The presence of stenotrophomonas and xanthomonas infections indicates that the patient is at risk for ongoing or recurrent infections, which may require adjustment of antibiotic therapy.
3. Right thalamic hemorrhagic CVA: Although the CT scan shows no evidence of bleed expansion, there is a risk of further neurological complications due to the existing right thalamic hematoma.
4. COPD exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD puts him at risk for exacerbations, especially if there is inadequate control of his respiratory status.
5. HCV cirrhosis: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of CVA (stroke), hemorrhagic, respiratory failure, chronic, ventricular tachycardia, sustained. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been able to wean off the vent to trach collar. The patient has restarted on home dose of methadone, tube feeds, and treatment dose bactrim for stenotrophomonas/xanthomonas. The CT head shows expected evolution of right thalamic hematoma, with no new neuro recs. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/54 to 140/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's lab results are within normal limits, except for elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic respiratory failure and is currently on treatment dose bactrim for stenotrophomonas/xanthomonas. This suggests a potential infection, which needs to be monitored and treated accordingly.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's blood pressure readings show fluctuations, indicating potential hemodynamic instability. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate interventions may be necessary.
3. Worsening"

   progressive disease/ hemoptysis, he will need a course of antifungal Rx
   ( at least 6 weeks ).
   He will transition back to rehab today. CVL in place does not appear

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, COPD, and previous infections such as Nocardia and Aspergillus in the sputum. The patient presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, likely due to mucous plugging or pneumonia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for Stenotrophomonas infection.

The patient has experienced a significant drop in hematocrit from 39.7 to 32.9, which is concerning for possible gastrointestinal bleeding. However, there are no signs of overt bleeding and the guaiac test is negative. The trend in hematocrit levels will be monitored every 8 hours, and the patient will undergo guaiac testing on all stools. 

The patient also has a history of a recent stroke (thalamus), and imaging has shown an expected evolution of the right thalamic hematoma. The patient is being followed up with any new neurological recommendations and is avoiding treatment dose anticoagulation.

Additionally, the patient has chronic respiratory failure secondary to COPD exacerbation and mucous plugging versus underlying pneumonia. A video swallow has been scheduled for this morning, and the patient will continue oxygen via tracheostomy mask. Bactrim coverage will be continued for the cultured Stenotrophomonas.

Furthermore, the patient had a sustained ventricular tachycardia, but is currently stable"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, COPD, and previous infections such as Nocardia and Aspergillus in the sputum. He recently experienced a thalamic cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and presented with respiratory distress, likely due to mucous plugging or pneumonia. The patient has a tracheostomy in place and has had multiple organisms on recent sputum cultures, including Aspergillus and Stenotrophomonas. Imaging revealed a right upper lobe cavitary lesion and probable aspergilloma. The patient is currently being treated with TMP-SMX for Stenotrophomonas and will be considered for voriconazole treatment for Aspergillus. Suctioning, chest physiotherapy, and follow-up imaging and sputum cultures are planned. The patient also has a history of IVDU and is on methadone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia suggest a potential complication of respiratory failure. This can be exacerbated by continued mucous plugging or progression of the Aspergillus infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and recent sputum cultures indicating the presence of multiple organisms raise the possibility of pneumonia. It is essential to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms and consider appropriate antibiotic therapy.
3. Aspergilloma: The presence of a cavit"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and recent thalamic cerebral vascular accident (CVA). He presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, likely due to mucous plugging or pneumonia. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been treated for Stenotrophomonas in his sputum. His hemoglobin levels have decreased from 39.7 to 32.9, indicating significant anemia. The patient also complains of abdominal pain but no gross bleeding is observed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. This can be caused by mucous plugging or pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been treated for Stenotrophomonas in his sputum, indicating a possible infection. Pneumonia could further exacerbate the patient's respiratory condition.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased significantly, indicating anemia. This may be due to chronic blood loss or acute blood loss from gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient complains of abdominal pain, which could indicate gastrointestinal bleeding. However, no gross bleeding is observed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and previous tracheostomy placement. He presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, likely due to mucous plugging versus pneumonia. The patient has a recent thalamic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and has been admitted from a rehabilitation facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxia indicate a high risk for respiratory failure. Mucous plugging is a significant concern, as it can lead to further obstruction of the airways and compromise breathing.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms could also be indicative of pneumonia, which is a potential complication in individuals with COPD.
3. Thalamic Hemorrhagic CVA: The patient has a recent history of a thalamic hemorrhagic stroke. This condition poses a risk for neurological deterioration and potential expansion of the hemorrhage.
4. Infection: The patient has been colonized with multiple organisms including Aspergillus and Stenotrophomonas, which can lead to further infections and complications.
5. Abdominal Pain: The patient complains of abdominal pain, which may indicate an underlying gastrointestinal issue or bleeding.
6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) levels have been dropping, indicating a potential for anemia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of Hepatitis C (HCV), Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and tracheostomy placement. He has a history of Nocardia and Aspergillus in his sputum. The patient presented with respiratory distress and hypoxia, which is likely due to mucous plugging versus pneumonia (PNA). The patient has also had a recent thalamic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or stroke.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), blood pressure ranging from 107/43 mmHg to 156/68 mmHg, heart rate of 82 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals alertness and orientation, limited communication due to tracheostomy, mild anxiety, clear pupils, normal neck movement, rales over the anterior apices and left lower lobe region, regular heart sounds, and normoactive bowel sounds with mild tenderness over the lower quadrants. The patient has weakness in his left upper and lower extremities, as well as intact sensation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, and hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis. He was admitted from a rehabilitation facility with respiratory distress, and initial concern for a pulmonary embolism (PE) was ruled out. The patient has had multiple organisms on recent sputum cultures, including Aspergillus and Stenotrophomonas, as well as a remote history of Nocardia. Imaging revealed a right upper lobe (RUL) cavitary lesion and probable aspergilloma. The patient is currently on TMP-SMX for Stenotrophomonas and requires further evaluation for Aspergillus infection. The patient also has a recent right thalamic hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), with no evidence of bleed expansion on recent CT scan. He has a history of intravenous drug use (IVDU) and is on methadone maintenance. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.3 C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/59 to 156/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on tracheal mask. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count and platelets, but otherwise within normal limits. The patient's nutritional"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent nocardia infection, and cavitary right upper lobe lesion, now complicated by aspergilloma and STM colonization. He presents from rehab with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been accepted to return to LTAC. The patient has a decreased hematocrit level, likely due to hemodilution, but there are no signs of active bleeding. He also has a history of recurrent aspiration, and recent modified barium swallow test showed poor swallow technique.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to a mucus plug or aspiration event. Given his colonization with STM and aspergillus, there is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recurrent aspiration puts him at risk for developing aspiration pneumonia, which can be a serious complication.
3. Infection: The patient's history of nocardia and aspergilloma infections indicates an increased risk for further infections. Close monitoring and appropriate antimicrobial therapy are necessary to prevent complications.
4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has right lower extremity edema, which may suggest a potential risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent pulmonary embolism if not adequately managed with prophylaxis.
5. Worsening COPD: The patient's underlying severe COP"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of COPD, recent hospitalization for CVA, recurrent aspiration, and colonization of STM and aspergilloma. He presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and decreased hemoglobin concentration. The patient is currently on several medications, including atrovent, methadone, colace, bactrim, and lansoprazole. He has poor dentition, muscle wasting, and right lower extremity edema. His neurological status is described as attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and purposeful movements. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, and prolonged PTT.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to a mucus plug or aspiration event. This condition requires close monitoring and appropriate management, such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation if necessary.

2. Aspiration: The patient's failed modified barium swallow suggests an inability to protect the airway during swallowing. This increases the risk of recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Continued aspiration precautions and nutritional support through tube feeds are necessary.

3. Decreased hemoglobin concentration: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased significantly. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which may include internal bleeding or hemolysis. Repeat measurement of hemoglobin and assessment for any signs of bleeding"
