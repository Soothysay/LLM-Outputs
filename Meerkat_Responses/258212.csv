   [**Age over 90 **] year old F with dementia, G-tube, s/p recent aspiration PNA now with
   recurrent respiratory  failure and fever.
   # Respiratory failure:  Tachypnic and hypoxic on arrival to the ED.
   Given the recent admission with aspiration PNA and now fever and
   slightly elevated WBC, this presentation is suggestive of recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia or HAP. Given recent ESBL Ecoli PNA, will switch
   from Zosyn to Meropenem. Meropenem and Vanc should adequate cover
   anaerobes and HAP as well.  She also has chronic diastolic heart
   failure which could predispose her to pulmonary edema; however, on exam
   she appears dry w/o JVD, edema or crackles. Blood Cx now w/ GNRs, ?

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 96-year-old female with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU due to recurrent respiratory failure and fever. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia and chronic diastolic heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.4Â°C, blood pressure ranging from 87/33 mmHg to 97/36 mmHg, heart rate between 70-91 bpm, respiratory rate set at 12 with spontaneous rate of 0, oxygen saturation at 99%, and sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,036 mL with output of 445 mL, resulting in a balance of 2,591 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 50, HCO3- of 36, lactate of 0.8, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 1,025. Physical examination reveals a large decubitus over the right buttock without purulence, soft rhonchi throughout the upper airway, and sedation. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has several ongoing issues that need to be addressed. First, there is a concern for recurrent respiratory failure and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to recent aspiration pneumonia and fever. The patient will continue on meropenem and vancomycin for adequate coverage of ana"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, G-tube, and a history of recent aspiration pneumonia. She presented with recurrent respiratory failure and fever, suggesting a possible recurrence of aspiration pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Given her recent infection with ESBL E. coli, the antibiotic regimen has been switched from Zosyn to Meropenem. This combination, along with Vancomycin, should provide adequate coverage for anaerobes and HAP. The patient also has chronic diastolic heart failure, which could predispose her to pulmonary edema, but on examination, she appears dry without jugular venous distention (JVD), edema, or crackles.

The patient's blood pressure is low at 95/38 mmHg, but per nursing staff, this is her baseline. Her lactate level of 1.6 is not suggestive of sepsis. She has received 2 liters of normal saline already. The patient requires ongoing ICU monitoring, and further intravenous fluids are not required at this time. The goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

The patient has a dirty urinary catheter, possibly due to chronic Foley catheterization or infection. Further evaluation is needed, including follow-up urine culture, changing the Foley catheter, and continuing the current antibiotic regimen.

The patient has a sacral decubitus ulcer that was previously debrided and showed mixed bacterial flora. Currently,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis and respiratory failure. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia and is currently on invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/44 to 87/33 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is being treated with antibiotics (Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levofloxacin) for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or healthcare-associated resistant organism. She also has a Foley catheter and is receiving fluids and medications through IV lines.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, possibly due to acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, fever, and slightly elevated white blood cell count. The differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia, which has been empirically treated with Vancomycin, Meropenem, and Levofloxacin. Other considerations include congestive heart failure, although the examination and chest X-ray do not support this. The patient is mechanically ventilated with a respiratory support system set at a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 95. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.55, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 260, ventilation-perfusion (Ve) of 6.7 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 260.

The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, possibly caused by Gram-negative bacteria from blood cultures. She is hemodynamically stable and receiving appropriate antibiotics. There is a concern for indwelling Foley catheter colonization or infection, which may require a change in the catheter. The source of sepsis remains unclear. The patient has a large ulcer on her sacrum, which appears unchanged from the last admission. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and her family needs to be clarified on this matter. The patient will continue to receive ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are being implemented."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia, who presented with respiratory failure and fever. She has had recent aspiration pneumonia and is now experiencing recurrent respiratory failure and fever. There are concerns about aspiration pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). The patient has chronic diastolic heart failure but does not show signs of pulmonary edema. Blood cultures show growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs), which could be from either lung or urinary tract infection. Urine culture is growing E. coli. The patient's blood pressure is low, but it is considered her baseline. She has received intravenous fluids and is stable. She also has a sacral decubitus ulcer, which was previously debrided and showed mixed bacterial flora, currently appearing uninfected. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70 and is on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. The patient's niece wants to continue with intermittent intubations and does not want a tracheostomy or CPR. Palliative care has been consulted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's recent aspiration pneumonia and recurrent respiratory failure, there is a potential for further episodes of aspiration pneumonia.
2. Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP): The patient's presentation suggests HAP, which can be caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of E. coli in the urine culture indicates a UTI,"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   [**Age over 90 **] year old F with dementia, G-tube, s/p recent aspiration PNA now with
   recurrent respiratory  failure and fever.
   # Respiratory failure:  Tachypneic and hypoxic on arrival to the ED.
   Given the recent admission with aspiration PNA and now fever and
   slightly elevated WBC, this presentation is suggestive of recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia or HAP. Given recent ESBL Ecoli PNA, will switch
   from Zosyn to Meropenem. Meropenem and Vanc should adequate cover
   anaerobes and HAP as well.  She also has chronic diastolic heart
   failure which could predispose her to pulmonary edema; however, on exam
   she appears dry w/o JVD, edema or crackles. Blood Cx now w/ GNRs, ?
   lung vs. urine. Urinary legionella antigen negative.
   - repeat CXR today
   - cont Meropenem / Levofloxacin, d/c Vanc given no GPCs; will need
   14-day course
   - if clinically worsens, would add on gentamycin
   - add [**Last Name (un) 46**] to meropenam on e. coli from urine
   - f/u sputum cx, blood cx; check daily blood cx
   - mechanically ventilated using PS; check ABG as needed
   - limit sedation, did not require any on last admission
   # UTI: Chronic foley vs infection. Blood Cx now w/ GNRs, ? lung vs.
   urine. Foley now changed. Urine Cx growing E.coli.
   - cont Meropenem / Levofloxacin, d/c Vanc given no GPCs; will need
   14-day course
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx; check daily blood cx
   # Low BP: On last admission presented with sepsis. BP now 95/38 with
   MAP 50. However, per nursing staff this is patient
s baseline. Her
   lactate of 1.6 is also not suggestive of sepsis. Has received 2 L NS
   already. Stable.
   - ICU monitoring
   - no further IVF for now
   - keep SBP >90 with IVF boluses as needed
   # Sacral Decub: debrided on last  admission with microbiology showing
   mixed baterial flora, currently appears uninfected.
   - continue to monitor
   # Afib: currently in NSR with HR 70

   Code status: FULL CODE
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation using pressure support (PS). Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 119/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 40% FiO2.

The patient's recent medical history includes a previous admission for aspiration pneumonia and an episode of sepsis. She has chronic diastolic heart failure but does not exhibit signs of pulmonary edema. The patient's blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods (GNRs), and her urine culture shows the presence of E. coli. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 7.5 K/uL.

The patient's laboratory results reveal a hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, serum creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL, platelet count of 303 K/uL, sodium level of 106 mg/dL, potassium level of 28 mEq/L, and a glucose level of 96 mg/dL. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are significantly elevated at 14.2/57.0/1.2, respectively. Calcium and magnesium levels are within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray taken on [**2106-6-1**] 05:59 PM, [**2106-6-2**] 08:03 AM, [**2106-6-2**] 02:06 PM, and [**2106-6-3**] 03:03 AM. These images are not available for review.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's recurrent respiratory failure, fever, and elevated white blood cell count suggest recurrent aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She will be switched from Zosyn to Meropenem for coverage against ESBL-producing E. coli. Vancomycin and Meropenem should provide adequate coverage for anaerobes and HAP. Blood cultures are pending, and a repeat chest X-ray is planned.

2. UTI: The patient's chronic Foley catheter may be contributing to a urinary tract infection. Blood cultures now show GNRs, possibly from the lung or urine. The Foley catheter has been changed. Urine cultures growing E. coli will be followed up, and daily blood cultures will be checked.

3. Low blood pressure: The patient's blood pressure is low, but the nursing staff believes it is her baseline. Her lactate level is not suggestive of sepsis, and she"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, G-tube, and recent aspiration pneumonia now experiencing recurrent respiratory failure and fever. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis, and an e. coli urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's use of accessory muscles and recurrent respiratory failure indicate a possible aspiration event, which can lead to pneumonia.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's recent hospitalization and the presence of fever and respiratory symptoms raise the possibility of HAP.

3. Sepsis: The patient's low blood pressure (hypotension) and elevated heart rate (tachycardia) suggest systemic infection, leading to sepsis.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of e. coli in the urine indicates a UTI, which can potentially worsen the patient's overall condition.

5. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The large ulcer on the patient's sacrum appears unchanged from the last admission and may progress if not properly managed.

6. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient's irregular heartbeat indicates an episode of Afib, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.

7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, gastrostomy tube, and recent aspiration pneumonia now presenting with recurrent respiratory failure and fever. She has impaired skin integrity with a large decubitus over her right buttock, chronic diastolic heart failure, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is mechanically ventilated using pressure support mode, and her vital signs are stable. She has chronic Foley catheterization with suspected infection, as evidenced by blood cultures growing GNRs (possibly E.coli) and urine cultures growing E.coli as well. The patient's blood pressure is low, but the lactate level suggests that she is not currently in septic shock. Her sacral decubitus was previously debrided due to mixed bacterial flora but currently appears uninfected. She has a history of atrial fibrillation but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. The patient's goals of care include palliative care consultation and further discussion with her niece regarding her treatment options. The patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection, and her nutrition and glycemic control are being managed accordingly."

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia, who was admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory failure and fever. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient's recent medical history includes aspiration pneumonia and an infection caused by ESBL E. coli. She also has chronic diastolic heart failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient's presentation suggests recurrent respiratory failure and fever, which could indicate aspiration pneumonia or HAP. Appropriate antibiotic coverage should be maintained based on the culture and sensitivity results.
2. GNR bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures have grown GNRs, which are sensitive to meropenem but resistant to levofloxacin. Continuous meropenem therapy should be continued, along with the appropriate duration of treatment based on the culture and sensitivity results.
3. Foley catheter infection: The patient's urine culture is growing E. coli, indicating a possible urinary tract infection. The Foley catheter should be changed, and meropenem therapy should be continued.
4. Sacral decubitus: The patient has a large decubitus over her right buttock. Close monitoring is required to prevent any complications associated with the decubitus.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, but according to the nursing staff, it may be her baseline. Further evaluation and management"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual with dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia with recurrent respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient remains mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure. The sepsis is believed to be caused by a GNR bacteria from the blood, and sensitivity testing is pending. There is also evidence of E. coli in the urine, which may be a source of the sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1Â°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/43 to 148/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 302 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The respiratory system is Rhonchorous, indicating the presence of secretions in the airways.

The patient's blood work shows a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.5 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 22%, platelet (Plt) count of 303 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.4 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 102 mg/dL. Other lab results include prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/international normalized ratio (INR): 13.9/35.2/1.2, lactic acid level of 0.8 mmol/L, calcium (Ca++) level of 7.9 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) level of 2.0 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) level of 2.4 mg/dL.

The patient's medical history includes dementia, recent aspiration pneumonia, and recurrent respiratory failure. The physical examination reveals that the patient is thin and kyphotic, with warm skin and a sacral decubitus ulcer. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli, but movement and tone assessments were not performed.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and sacral decubitus ulcer infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, who was admitted for aspiration pneumonia. She has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure and fever, suggestive of recurrent aspiration pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient also has chronic diastolic heart failure and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's elevated WBC count, fever, and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to prevent the progression to sepsis with organ dysfunction.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of respiratory failure require careful management. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation should be maintained, and weaning from mechanical ventilation may be considered once the patient's condition stabilizes.
3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's history of aspiration and recurrent respiratory failure, there is a high risk of developing aspiration pneumonia. Continuous monitoring for symptoms and early identification of any new respiratory distress are crucial.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The presence of GNRs in the blood culture raises concerns about a concurrent UTI. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, and regular follow-up with urine cultures is necessary.
5. GNR bacteremia: The patient has GNR bacteremia, which is sensitive to meropenem. Continued monitoring of blood cultures and appropriate antibiotic therapy are important for treating this infection.
6. Osteomyelitis: The visible bone and"

   # Respiratory failure:  Tachypneic and hypoxic on arrival to the ED.
   Given the recent admission with aspiration PNA and now fever and
   slightly elevated WBC, this presentation is suggestive of recurrent
   aspiration pneumonia or HAP. Given recent ESBL Ecoli PNA, will switch
   from Zosyn to Meropenem. Meropenem and Vanc should adequate cover
   anaerobes and HAP as well.  She also has chronic diastolic heart
   failure which could predispose her to pulmonary edema; however, on exam
   she appears dry w/o JVD, edema or crackles. Blood Cx now w/ GNRs, ?
   lung vs. urine. Urinary legionella antigen negative.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old female with dementia, G-tube, and a history of recent aspiration pneumonia. She presented to the emergency department with tachypnea and hypoxia. She was found to have sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient's blood cultures showed growth of Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative rods, and Escherichia coli. She was switched from Zosyn to Meropenem due to recent ESBL E. coli pneumonia. She is being treated with Meropenem and Vancomycin for adequate coverage of anaerobes and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Chronic foley catheter versus infection is suspected, and the foley catheter has been changed. Urine culture is growing E. coli. The patient's vital signs are stable, fever curve and white blood cell count are trending down, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. She has a low blood pressure but this is considered her baseline. Lactic acid level is not suggestive of sepsis. The patient has impaired skin integrity, likely due to sacral decubitus. She is currently in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70. The patient's goals of care are DNR/DNI. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an elderly female with dementia who was admitted with aspiration pneumonia and recurrent respiratory failure.
- She remains mechanically ventilated and has passed a spontaneous breathing trial with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 102.
- The patient's condition is limited by secretions that accumulate every hour.
- She has sepsis caused by Gram-negative rods from blood cultures, with E. coli being the most prevalent organism.
- E. coli has also been found in her urine, which is suspected to be the source of the sepsis.
- The patient's hemodynamic status is stable, and Vancomycin (Vanc) has been initiated based on the sensitivities of Gram-positive cocci.
- The source of the infection could be a wound, and a longer course of antibiotics may be necessary.
- The patient will have a sputum culture today to identify any other potential pathogens.
- Vancomycin trough levels and renal clearance will be monitored, and dosing adjustments for Vancomycin will be made if necessary.
- There is an indwelling Foley catheter that may be causing a urinary tract infection (UTI), and it will be changed.
- The e. coli causing the UTI is not the same as the one found in the blood.
- The patient has a large sacral decubitus ulcer that appears unchanged from the last admission.
- She is at risk for osteomyelitis, and blood cultures will be checked."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) with recurrent respiratory failure and sepsis. 

The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Respiratory Failure: The patient remains mechanically ventilated due to acute on chronic respiratory failure. She passed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 102. However, her secretions are limited every hour.
- Sepsis: The patient has sepsis caused by two bottles of Gram-negative rods from blood, specifically polymicrobial e.coli. She also has e.coli in her urine, which is suspected to be the source of sepsis. Her hemodynamics are stable, and she is being treated with vancomycin tailored based on sensitivities of gram-positive cocci. The source of sepsis could be a wound, and a longer course of antibiotics may be necessary. Blood cultures have been sent, and sputum will be checked today. Vancomycin trough levels and renal clearance will be calculated, and dosing of amiodarone will be determined.
- e. coli UTI: The patient has an e.coli urinary tract infection, possibly due to colonization from an indwelling Foley catheter. The Foley catheter will be changed, and it is not the same bug as in her blood.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU for sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. She presented with recurrent respiratory failure, fever, and a slightly elevated white blood cell count. The patient has a history of recent aspiration pneumonia and now has evidence of another respiratory infection. Her blood culture is positive with Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci in clusters. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today to attempt extubation.

The patient also has a urinary tract infection with E. coli that is sensitive to meropenem. She has bacteremia with E. coli and enterococcus, and her blood cultures are negative after initial growth. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has a history of chronic diastolic heart failure. Her skin integrity is impaired due to a large decubitus ulcer over her right buttock.

The patient's current medications include lansoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), flowsheet data as of 07:52 AM on 06/06/2106, and other ICU medications. She has a history of allergies to Depakote (oral) and unknown allergies. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 91/16 mmHg to 163/65 mm"

   Tachypneic and hypoxic on arrival to the ED.  Given the recent

   this presentation is suggestive of recurrent aspiration pneumonia or
   HAP. Given recent ESBL Ecoli PNA, will switch from Zosyn to Meropenem.
   Meropenem and Vanc should adequate cover anaerobes and HAP as well.
   She also has chronic diastolic heart failure which could predispose her
   to pulmonary edema; however, on exam she appears dry w/o JVD, edema or
   crackles. Blood Cx now w/ GNRs and GPCs, ? lung vs. urine. Urinary
   legionella antigen negative. Sputum GS w/ GPCs, species pending.

","The patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia, G-tube, and recent aspiration pneumonia. She is currently admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing recurrent respiratory failure and fever, suggesting recurrent aspiration pneumonia or healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). She also has chronic diastolic heart failure, but there are no signs of pulmonary edema on examination.

The patient's blood culture shows growth of Enterococcus, and her respiratory culture is pending. The initial gram stain of her sputum reveals Gram-positive cocci in pairs in clusters, which could indicate Enterococcus species. The patient's WBC count is slightly elevated, and she has been febrile. The source of the infection could be either the lungs or the urinary tract, as both are positive for Gram-negative rods (GNRs) and Gram-positive cocci (GPCs). The urinary antigen test for Legionella was negative.

The patient has been treated with meropenem and vancomycin (Vanc) for suspected polymicrobial infection, including coverage for anaerobes and HAP. The meropenem level is adequate, and the vancomycin troughs will be monitored prior to the fourth dose due to the patient's low glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The Enterococcus species is pending sensitivity testing, and the treatment course will be extended to 6 weeks given the polymicrobial infection and osteomyelitis. The patient's blood cultures are now negative, and her fever curve and WBC count are trending down.

The patient's blood pressure has been stable, and her lactate level does not suggest sepsis. She has received 2 liters of normal saline already. She will continue to be monitored in the ICU, with a goal of extubation today. The patient's chronic Foley catheter may be contributing to a urinary tract infection (UTI), which is also being treated with meropenem. Her sacral decubitus was debrided on the last admission and appears uninfected at present.

The patient has atrial fibrillation but is currently in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70. She has a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate (DNR/DNI) status. Her goals of care include comfort measures, glycemic control, and prevention of stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and other complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 92-year-old female with dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia with recurrent respiratory failure and sepsis. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2Â°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 146/63 to 163/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system resistance index (RSBI) of 117, indicating a potential risk for extubation failure.

The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids and antibiotics, specifically meropenem and vancomycin, for the sepsis. The cultures have shown the presence of E. coli in the blood and urine. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, while other lab results such as hemoglobin, creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin and kyphotic appearance, warm skin with sacral decubitus, and signs of muscle wasting. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive and follows simple commands but has not been assessed for movement or muscle tone.

The patient's plan includes continuing with aggressive care, including antibiotics tailored based on sensitivities of gram-positive cocci, monitoring for signs of improvement, and considering longer-term antibiotic therapy if the source of infection is unclear. The patient's feeding tube"

","The patient is a 92-year-old female with dementia, who has been admitted to the ICU for aspiration pneumonia (PNA) and recurrent respiratory failure. She remains mechanically ventilated due to acute on chronic respiratory failure. The patient's recent blood cultures have shown growth of gram-negative rods, specifically Escherichia coli, which is the same organism isolated from her urine. The source of sepsis is suspected to be the urinary tract, possibly due to an indwelling Foley catheter. The patient's hemodynamics are stable, and she is receiving appropriate antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem.

The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, but is currently in normal sinus rhythm. She also has a large sacral decubitus ulcer, which appears unchanged from her last admission. There is a concern for osteomyelitis given the presence of blood gases and the need for a prolonged course of antibiotics.

The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 268 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 117, indicating the need for continued mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 361 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and abnormal liver"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly, frail individual who presented with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. They were admitted to the ICU and received invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient successfully underwent extubation after passing a spontaneous breathing trial. Throughout their stay, they were on various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Meropenem), Heparin for prophylaxis, Lansoprazole, and Depakote. The patient's vital signs were stable, with a temperature of 37.9Â°C (100.2Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/28 to 91/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient was sedated and exhibited soft rhonchi throughout the upper airway. Physical examination also revealed a large decubitus over the right buttock without purulence expressed. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's renal function was within normal limits, while their liver enzymes and bilirubin levels were slightly elevated. The patient's blood cultures were positive for gram-negative rods. The patient's condition was managed with appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia."

   recurrent respiratory failure and fever.
   # Respiratory failure: Improved, extubated. Still hypoxic but
   tolerating NC. Was producing sputum which  is now minimal. Sputum
   culture only showing  sparse orophyaryneal flora. CXR w/o obvious PNA
   but poor study. Respiratory failure [**3-15**] recurrent aspiration PNA vs [**3-15**]

   urine. Foley now changed. Urine Cx growing E.coli senstive to meropenem
   - cont meropenem
   # Bacteremia: E.coli sensitive to meropenem, resistant to levofloxacin.
   Enterococcus pending sensitivities. HD stable, fever curve and WBC
   trending down. Surveillance blood cx neg. Vanc level 15. Given
   polymicrobial infection and visible [**Last Name (LF) 48**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] treat this infection as

   osteo
   # Low BP:  Stable On last admission presented with sepsis. BP now 95/38
   with MAP 50. However, per nursing staff this is patient
s baseline. Her
   lactate of 1.6 is also not suggestive of sepsis. Has received 2 L NS
   already. Stable.
   - ICU monitoring
   - no further IVF for now
   - keep SBP >90 with IVF boluses as needed
   # Sacral Decub: debrided on last admission with microbiology showing
   mixed baterial flora, currently appears uninfected.
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, G-tube, and recent aspiration pneumonia (APN) who presented with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has been in the ICU and was on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing trial lasting 1.5 hours in the morning. The patient tolerated 4 liters of nasal cannula oxygen all day and showed improvement in her respiratory condition.

The patient has a history of chronic Foley catheter versus infection, with blood cultures now showing gram-negative rods (GNRs), possibly from the lung or urine. The Foley catheter has been changed, and urine cultures are growing E. coli sensitive to meropenem. The patient also has bacteremia caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to meropenem but resistant to levofloxacin. Enterococcus sensitivity is pending.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 149/28 to 60/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and her fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 1,157 mL, including 347 mL of intravenous fluids. The patient has produced 447 mL of urine and received 640 mL of intravenous fluids, with a total output of 755 mL. The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia and a history of recent aspiration pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis, impaired skin integrity, and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently on 4L NC (nasal cannula) oxygen delivery. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 149/28-60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 7.5 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin at 7.9 g/dL, normal platelet count at 115 mg/dL, and mildly decreased bicarbonate level of 24.1 mEq/L. The blood cultures have grown E. coli sensitive to meropenem, and Enterococcus is pending sensitivity testing. The patient's Cr (creatinine) level is 0.4 mg/dL, and her TCO2 (total carbon dioxide) level is 36.

The patient's medical conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and chronic foley catheter versus infection.

She was intubated but has since been extubated and is doing well. The patient has multiple medical complications including a large sacral decubitus ulcer, an atrial fibrillation that is currently in sinus rhythm, and a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli. The source of the infection is suspected to be a wound, and the patient will be treated for osteomyelitis with a 6-week course of antibiotics. The attending physician agrees with the resident's assessment and plan, adding that the duration and choice of antibiotic should be discussed with the infectious disease team. The patient's glycemic control and nutrition are being managed in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The patient's wound is suspected to be the source of the infection, leading to osteomyelitis. This condition will be treated with a 6-week course of antibiotics.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an E. coli UTI, which needs to be addressed. Foley catheter change may be necessary.
3. Sacral decubitus ulcer: The patient has a large sacral decubitus ulcer that appears unchanged from the last admission. It is concerning for osteomyelitis given the positive blood culture. Treatment for 6 weeks is planned.
4. Atrial fibrillation (Afib): The patient has a history of Afib, currently in sinus rhythm. She is on amiodarone for management.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient has had recurrent respiratory failure, which is resolving after being extubated.
6. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is now being treated with appropriate antibiotics.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team for further evaluation and management."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly female with dementia who has been admitted to the ICU with sepsis, respiratory failure, and recent aspiration pneumonia. The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure and is currently extubated. She has a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) and do-not-intubate (DNI) status.

24-hour events include the initiation and discontinuation of invasive ventilation, administration of antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), and various infusions. The patient's vital signs are within normal range except for low blood pressure. The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin, ASA, and amiodarone. Her fluid balance shows an intake of 1157 mL and output of 755 mL.

Physical examination reveals a thin, kyphotic patient with a nasotracheal tube in place. Her cardiovascular examination is notable for regular rhythm without murmurs or gallops. Respiratory examination is clear anteriorly. Abdominal examination shows softness, bowel sounds, and muscle wasting with an inability to stand. Neurologic examination indicates attentiveness, following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and no assessment of movement or tone.

Laboratory results show low white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values such as PT/PTT/INR, lactic acid, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal limits.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with dementia who has recently experienced aspiration pneumonia and recurrent respiratory failure, leading to sepsis. She is currently extubated and doing well. The patient's medical history includes a wound that is suspected to be the source of infection, a urinary tract infection caused by E. coli, and atrial fibrillation which is currently in sinus rhythm due to amiodarone treatment. The patient also has sacral decubitus with a large ulcer, indicating possible osteomyelitis, and a Foley catheter that may be colonized or infected. The patient's vital signs are stable, with slightly low blood pressure. She has received various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, anticoagulation therapy, and nutritional support. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Osteomyelitis: The presence of a large ulcer in the sacral decubitus area raises concern for osteomyelitis, a bone infection. This condition may require prolonged antibiotic therapy.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a UTI caused by E. coli. It is important to monitor for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. Close monitoring of heart rhythm and anticoagulation therapy is necessary.
4. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving nutritional support through fiber source"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He has been receiving various medications including heparin for prophylaxis, antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin), and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 89/33 mmHg to 149/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood glucose levels have been within normal range. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal based on creatinine levels, but there are some abnormalities in liver function tests.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition indicates sepsis without organ dysfunction. It is important to monitor for any signs of deterioration or progression to septic shock.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection. Regular assessment and appropriate wound care should be provided.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and ensuring adequate oxygenation and ventilation is crucial.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia, gastrostomy tube, and recent aspiration pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's current condition is as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure has improved, and she is extubated. She is tolerating a nasal cannula and producing minimal sputum. Sputum culture shows only oropharyngeal flora, and a chest X-ray does not show any obvious pneumonia but has poor quality. The differential diagnosis includes recurrent aspiration pneumonia versus sepsis.

2. UTI: The patient has chronic Foley catheterization, which may be causing a urinary tract infection (UTI). Blood culture now shows Gram-negative rods (GNRs), possibly indicating lung or urinary source infection. The urine culture is growing E. coli, which is sensitive to meropenem. The Foley catheter has been changed, and meropenem is being continued.

3. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to meropenem. Enterococcus is pending sensitivity testing. The patient's fever curve and white blood cell count are trending down, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. Vancomycin levels are 15, and an infectious disease (ID) consult recommends discontinuing vancomycin as Enterococcus should be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 96-year-old female with dementia who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory failure and fever. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia (AP) and is currently tolerating a nasal cannula without significant respiratory distress. Her recent sputum culture showed only oropharyngeal flora, indicating that her respiratory failure is likely due to recurrent aspiration rather than a primary lung process.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. She is being treated with meropenem and vancomycin, which have been effective against her infections. However, due to her history of MRSA, the antibiotics will be continued for a 6-week course. The decision to treat the infection as osteomyelitis is based on the polymicrobial infection and visible bone on imaging.

The patient also has chronic foley catheter-associated urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, which is sensitive to meropenem. The catheter has been changed, and the urine culture is growing E. coli sensitive to meropenem. Therefore, meropenem will be continued for the UTI.

The patient's blood culture has grown E. coli sensitive to meropenem and Enterococcus pending sensitivities. Her fever curve and white blood cell count are trending down, indicating improvement in her bacteremia. Vancomycin levels are at 15 mg/L, and it will"

","Summary:
The patient is a 101-year-old female with dementia, G-tube, and a history of recent aspiration pneumonia now presenting with recurrent respiratory failure and fever. She has impaired skin integrity and respiratory failure, but has shown improvement in respiratory failure and is tolerating a nasal cannula. The patient's blood culture shows gram-negative rods (GNRs), and her urine culture is growing E. coli sensitive to meropenem, resistant to levofloxacin. Enterococcus pending sensitivities. She has a history of MRSA. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a fever curve and white blood cell count trending down. Surveillance blood culture is negative. The plan is to continue meropenem and vancomycin as we presume osteomyelitis and treat this infection accordingly. The patient's low blood pressure is considered a baseline, and she is stable with a lactate level of 1.6. She received 2 liters of normal saline already. The sacral decubitus ulcer appears uninfected and will be monitored. The patient is in normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 70 and will continue home amiodarone. The goals of care are DNR/DNI, and the patient's disposition is transfer to another facility."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia, who has a history of recent aspiration pneumonia and is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is recurrent respiratory failure and fever. Upon admission, she was hypoxic but tolerating a nasal cannula. She has a G-tube and has had a previous episode of aspiration pneumonia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C (100.6Â°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/41 to 128/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 36 mg/dL, and normal creatinine level of 0.4 mg/dL. The patient is on multiple medications including heparin sodium, morphine sulfate, and meropenem.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, impaired skin integrity, and acute respiratory failure. The respiratory failure has improved, and the patient is now extubated and tolerating a nasal cannula. The sputum culture only shows oropharyngeal flora, and the chest X-ray does not show any obvious pneumonia. The"

","The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of dementia, gastrointestinal tube placement, and recent aspiration pneumonia. She presented with sepsis and respiratory failure but has improved and was extubated. The patient has recurrent respiratory failure and fever, and there is a concern for aspiration pneumonia versus sepsis as the primary lung process. She also has chronic foley catheterization with a possible urinary tract infection, and blood cultures grew gram-negative rods (GNRs), possibly from the lung or urine. The E. coli in the blood culture is sensitive to meropenem, and the patient is currently receiving this medication. Enterococcus is pending sensitivities. Her vital signs are stable, fever curve is trending down, and surveillance blood cultures are negative. Vancomycin levels are at 15 mcg/mL, and the ID consultant recommends discontinuing vancomycin as Enterococcus should be sensitive. Liver function tests (LFTs) were obtained to evaluate for cholecystitis as a potential source of infection, which was negative. The ID consultant also recommended obtaining a CT scan to rule out an abscess. The patient's low blood pressure is stable, and her lactate level of 1.6 is not suggestive of sepsis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with dementia who has been admitted to the ICU due to sepsis, bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She has a history of aspiration pneumonia and recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/43 mmHg to 128/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently extubated and doing well.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 7.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 mg/dL, and elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 76 to 121 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver enzymes and electrolytes, are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals a thin, kyphotic appearance with muscle wasting and inability to stand. She has warm skin with sacral decubitus ulcers. Neurological examination is not assessed due to the patient's uncooperative nature.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis, and bacteremia caused by polymicrobial organisms including E. coli, Enterococcus, and GNRs."

","Summary:
The patient is a 93-year-old female with dementia who presented with sepsis, bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She has been in the ICU and is currently extubated. The patient's condition has improved, with resolution of respiratory failure. However, she still has septicemia caused by Gram-negative bacteria from blood cultures. The source of infection is suspected to be a large ulcer on her sacrum, which may also require treatment for osteomyelitis. The patient is currently receiving meropenem as antibiotic therapy. There is a discussion regarding the duration of antibiotic treatment, with the ID recommending a 2-week course rather than 6 weeks. Other medical conditions include atrial fibrillation, which is currently in sinus rhythm and being treated with amiodarone. The patient also has a Foley catheter, which may be colonized with E. coli but not the same strain as in the blood. The plan is to change the Foley catheter and discuss further treatment options with the ID team. The patient's code status is full code, and she will be returning to a nursing home after clarifying the antibiotic course.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrent respiratory failure: The patient's recent history of aspiration pneumonia and recurrent respiratory failure indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications.
2. Osteomyelitis: The presence of a large ulcer on the sacrum and positive blood cultures for E. coli and enterococcus suggest a possible"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with a history of dementia and recent aspiration pneumonia who has been admitted to the ICU for recurrent respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient's current condition includes polymicrobial bacteremia, respiratory failure, sacral decubitus ulcer, atrial fibrillation, and an e. coli urinary tract infection. The patient is extubated and doing well. The medical team recommends treating for identified organisms and a two-week course of antibiotics. The patient's blood cultures are negative, and they suspect the wound is the source of infection, which will be treated with a six-week course of antibiotics. The patient's Foley catheter will be changed, and the large sacral decubitus ulcer appears unchanged from the last admission, with concerns about osteomyelitis. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm due to amiodarone. The rest of the plan is noted in the resident's progress note. The patient will be discharged back to the nursing home after clarifying the antibiotic course. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Osteomyelitis: Given the presence of a large sacral decubitus ulcer and positive blood cultures, there is a concern for osteomyelitis. This can lead to a prolonged and difficult-to-treat infection.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has an e. coli UTI, which may progress to a more severe infection if not properly managed.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient has had recurrent episodes of respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
4. Sepsis: The patient is currently septic, and if not managed appropriately, sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and potentially death.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent this complication.
6. Stress ulcer: The patient is on stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), but if not managed properly, stress ulcers can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications if not appropriately managed."
