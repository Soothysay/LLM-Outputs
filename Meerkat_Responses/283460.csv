   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
   more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A bileaflet aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
   prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is normal
   for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An
   eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. If clinically suggested, the absence of a
   vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis,
   especially on a bileaflet aortic valve. Compared with the prior study
   (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-8**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation has increased. The right ventricular function may be
   slighlty less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis.  Concerning for DAH
   given CXR findings as well.  Could also be pulmonary edema with
   hemorrhage due to anticoagulation, HAP with hemorrhage, development of
   ARDS with bleeding for other reasons or from other source.  DAH most
   concerning, particularly in light of prior ARF (?renal manifestations),
   vasculitic rash, elevated ESR.  [**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative, ANCA negative
   - Intubate now (larger tube preferred).
   - Bronchoscopy today; looking for progressive or continued blood with
   subsequent BALs.
   - Run recent medication exposures for possible culprits of DAH.
   - Initiate workup for and ?treatment for anti-GBM disease.  Send
   anti-GBM.  ?future renal biopsy.
   - Consult rheumatology and pathology/pheresis.
   - Will increase steroids to 125 mg Q6h, ?further increase if rec by
   rheum.
   - Will discuss cyclophosphamide with rheumatology.
   - ?pheresis today given concern for anti-GBM disease.  Will plan on
   line placement in anticipation of this and/or hemodialysis in near
   future.
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP and send sputum culture.  Will
   discuss with ID re: appropriate regimen (vanc plus beta lactam, ?still
   need to continue cefazolin).
   - Hold heparin, will not give protamine at this time.  WIll given
   vitamin K IV.
   #. Endocarditis: Based on Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor).  High grade
   MSSA bacteremia. Per ID, antibiotics for planned 8 week course.
   Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to AIN.  Now on
   Cefazolin since [**1-22**] instead of Vanc as better for MSSA with increased
   dosing [**1-25**].
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Will continue cefazolin for now, but given would like to treat for
   HAP, will discuss appropriate regimen.
   # Atrial fibrillation/complete heart block. History this admission of
   CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p screw-in
   pacemaker.
   - Hold heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permament pacer.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr 1.5 on presentation; trending up
   now 3.4. Thought to be AIN due to Nafcillin.  Now unclear if this is
   truly manifestation of systemic vasculitis or anti-GBM disease.  Has
   had microscopic hematuria in recent past.
   - Resend urine.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - renally dose meds.
   - Change steroid to IV solumedrol.
   - diuresis likely when stabilized, vs. proceeding with HD.
   - ?future renal biopsy.
   # Anemia: Guaiac + stools this admission and have nuclear scan
   (negative).  Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely.
   - recheck Hct Q8-Q12.
   - Consented for blood products.
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD.  s/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   # Leukoclastic vasculitis.  Thought due to Nafcillin or IE. Improving
   overall.  ?Could be related to systemic disease causing DAH.
   - will discuss with derm re: any relation to DAH.
   - steroids as above.
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above.
   - As above, holding heparin.
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding antiHTNs in setting of bleeding as above.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF) and apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic heart block (CHB), and leukocytoclastic vasculitis on skin biopsy. The patient has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis raise concerns for DAH. This condition requires immediate attention and management, including intubation, bronchoscopy, and appropriate treatment.
2. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, which is likely related to AIN caused by nafcillin. It is unclear if this is a manifestation of systemic vasculitis or anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary, including renal dosing of medications, diuresis, and potential future renal biopsy.

   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic vasculitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis.  Concerning for DAH
   given CXR findings as well.  Could also be pulmonary edema with
   hemorrhage due to anticoagulation, HAP with hemorrhage, development of
   ARDS with bleeding for other reasons or from other source.  DAH most
   concerning, particularly in light of prior ARF (?renal manifestations),
   vasculitic rash, elevated ESR.  [**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative, ANCA negative
   - Intubate now (larger tube preferred).
   - Bronchoscopy today; looking for progressive or continued blood with
   subsequent BALs.
   - Run recent medication exposures for possible culprits of DAH.
   - Initiate workup for and ?treatment for anti-GBM disease.  Send
   anti-GBM.  ?future renal biopsy.
   - Consult rheumatology and pathology/pheresis.
   - Will increase steroids to 125 mg Q6h, ?further increase if rec by
   rheum.
   - Will discuss cyclophosphamide with rheumatology.
   - ?pheresis today given concern for anti-GBM disease.  Will plan on
   line placement in anticipation of this and/or hemodialysis in near
   future.
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP and send sputum culture.  Will
   discuss with ID re: appropriate regimen (vanc plus beta lactam, ?still
   need to continue cefazolin).
   - Hold heparin, will not give protamine at this time.  WIll given
   vitamin K IV.
   #. Endocarditis: Based on Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor).  High grade
   MSSA bacteremia. Per ID, antibiotics for planned 8 week course.
   Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to AIN.  Now on
   Cefazolin since [**1-22**] instead of Vanc as better for MSSA with increased
   dosing [**1-25**].
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Will continue cefazolin for now, but given would like to treat for
   HAP, will discuss appropriate regimen.
   # Atrial fibrillation/complete heart block. History this admission of
   CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p screw-in
   pacemaker.
   - Hold heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permament pacer.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Cr 1.5 on presentation; trending up
   now 3.4. Thought to be AIN due to Nafcillin.  Now unclear if this is
   truly manifestation of systemic vasculitis or anti-GBM disease.  Has
   had microscopic hematuria in recent past.
   - Resend urine.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - renally dose meds.
   - Change steroid to IV solumedrol.
   - diuresis likely when stabilized, vs. proceeding with HD.
   - ?future renal biopsy.
   # Anemia: Guaiac + stools this admission and have nuclear scan
   (negative).  Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely.
   - recheck Hct Q8-Q12.
   - Consented for blood products.
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD.  s/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   # Leukoclastic vasculitis.  Thought due to Nafcillin or IE. Improving
   overall.  ?Could be related to systemic disease causing DAH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), and atrial fibrillation. He was hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF) and apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic heart block (CHB), and leukocytoclastic vasculitis on skin biopsy. The patient is now in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis, which is concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Other potential medical complications include pulmonary edema with hemorrhage due to anticoagulation, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with hemorrhage, and the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with bleeding from other sources or another cause. The patient also has anemia, anemia of chronic disease (ACD), and leukoclastic vasculitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient presents with hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis, which are concerning for DAH. This condition is a medical emergency and requires immediate intervention.
2. Pulmonary Edema with Hemorrhage: The patient's respiratory symptoms could be attributed to pulmonary edema with hemorrhage due to"

   - Derm: Nothing
   - Intubated, Aline placed, Dialysis Catheter Placed.
   - Bronchoscopy: Diffuse Bleeding
   - ECHO:The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
   more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A bileaflet aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
   prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is normal
   for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An
   eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. If clinically suggested, the absence of a
   vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis,
   especially on a bileaflet aortic valve. Compared with the prior study
   (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-8**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation has increased. The right ventricular function may be
   slighlty less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   Concern for immune mediated unifying diagnosis, versus coagulopathy and
   AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. One critical piece of information may
   be whether immune cells cluster at arterioles in skin (vasculitis) or
   around capillaries (AIN and leukoclastic dermatitis proper). This will
   have important implications for treatment. Anti-GBM antibody test will
   be back tomorrow night at earliest per lab/pathologist. Rheumatology
   feel that this likely represents vasculitis and would like to broaden
   treatment to include plasmaphoresis then Cytoxan therapy. This will
   likely depend on whether pathology and Renal also feel that this is a
   vasculitis, not just AIN with associated rash after nafcillin or
   allopurinol. Goodpasture
s unlikely in view of presentation. ANCA is
   negative, but this is the case in about 20% of Wegener
s cases. No
   dysmorphic reds in urine, but this can sometimes be the case. Possible
   other vasculidites, but IgG, IgM and IgA staining in skin were not
   remarkable.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Possible Vasculitis
   Given findings on CXR, CVP, clinical presentation and bronchoscopy,
   likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and fluid overload. ESR
   is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal failure, all
   concerning for vasculitis, although there are other possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and ANCA are negative and anti-GBM is pending. If we seek a unifying
   diagnosis, may be that anti-GBM is negative given skin process.
   Variability in antibody responsible may account for this, and general
   approaches and pathology may eventually be most helpful. Renal biopsy
   is possible (see below). Presently conditions of each organ stabilized
   on high dose steroids, also suggestive. Rheumatology raised Cytoxan
   treatment and plasmaphoresis, but we will need to discuss this further
   with Renal and Pathology.
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Repeat bronchoscopy today to remove thrombus plugging and examine
   again.
   - Await anti-GBM
   - Discuss renal biopsy
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology and Renal
   - Continue Solu-medrol
   - Consider Cytoxan and plasmapheresis with d/w Renal and Rheumatology
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
 stop
   cefazolin
   - Hold heparin, ASA
   # Hemoptysis and Coagulopathy
   Evidence, perhaps with purpuric rash, of coagulopathy, or potentially
   as a manifestation of vasculitis. For the former and possibly uremic
   platelets, anticoagulant therapy. In favor of the latter is unifying
   diagnosis and co-occurrence with renal disease and rash. See discussion
   above
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 2.1 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Now unclear if this is truly manifestation of systemic
   vasculitis or drug reaction. White cells and eosinophils in urine
   consistent with either, although more classic of AIN.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Management as above, including IV Solu-medrol.
   - Possible renal biopsy tomorrow given that we are now holding
   anticoagulants
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.  Now on Cefazolin since [**1-22**]
   instead of Vanc as better for MSSA with increased dosing [**1-25**].
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Hold heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for
   other sites of blood loss, including GIT
   - Recheck Hct Q8-Q12.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Consented for blood products
   - Maintain access and active type and screen
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   - No heparin for now
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - As above, holding heparin.
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   - Consider TEE when stabilized and acute issues under control
 patient
   is actually receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding anti-HTNs in setting of bleeding as above.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who has undergone coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF) and apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), congestive heart failure (CHB), torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Possible Vasculitis: The patient presents with respiratory distress and hypoxemia, which may be secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and fluid overload. The presence of a purpuric macular rash, elevated ESR, and renal failure suggests a possible underlying vasculitis. ANCA and anti-GBM tests are pending, while IgG, IgM, and IgA staining in the skin were not remarkable.

2. Hemoptysis and Coagulopathy: The patient has evidence of coagulopathy, which may be related to the purpuric rash or as a manifestation of vasculitis. Anticoagulant therapy is being held due to the risk of bleeding,"

   medicine consult for possible plasmapheresis.  4. F/u with anti-GBM and
   ANCA. 5. Repeat echocardiogram (TEE) to evaluate for current cardiac
   status/function, vegetations and possible CHF. They would like to start
   Cytoxan if ID (given bacteremia) and Renal (i.e. If they agree with
   diagnosis) on board. Also recommend plasmaphoresis before Cytoxan.
   - Derm: Nothing
   - Intubated, Aline placed, Dialysis Catheter Placed.
   - Bronchoscopy: Diffuse Bleeding
   - ECHO:The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >55%). [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely
   more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right
   ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free wall
   function. There is abnormal septal motion/position consistent with
   right ventricular pressure/volume overload. A bileaflet aortic valve
   prosthesis is present. The transaortic gradient is normal for this
   prosthesis. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve, but
   cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. [The amount of regurgitation present is normal
   for this prosthetic aortic valve.] The mitral valve leaflets are
   moderately thickened. No masses or vegetations are seen on the mitral
   valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image quality. An
   eccentric, posteriorly directed jet of moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
   tricuspid valve, but cannot be fully excluded due to suboptimal image
   quality. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion. If clinically suggested, the absence of a
   vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis,
   especially on a bileaflet aortic valve. Compared with the prior study
   (images reviewed) of [**2128-1-8**], the severity of mitral and tricuspid
   regurgitation has increased. The right ventricular function may be
   slighlty less vigorous.

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   Concern for immune mediated unifying diagnosis, versus coagulopathy and
   AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. One critical piece of information may
   be whether immune cells cluster at arterioles in skin (vasculitis) or
   around capillaries (AIN and leukoclastic dermatitis proper). This will
   have important implications for treatment. Anti-GBM antibody test will
   be back tomorrow night at earliest per lab/pathologist. Rheumatology
   feel that this likely represents vasculitis and would like to broaden
   treatment to include plasmaphoresis then Cytoxan therapy. This will
   likely depend on whether pathology and Renal also feel that this is a
   vasculitis, not just AIN with associated rash after nafcillin or
   allopurinol. Goodpasture
s unlikely in view of presentation. ANCA is
   negative, but this is the case in about 20% of Wegener
s cases. No
   dysmorphic reds in urine, but this can sometimes be the case. Possible
   other vasculidites, but IgG, IgM and IgA staining in skin were not
   remarkable. This case will likely need pathophysiological rather than
   ontological approach.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure
   Concerning for DAH given CXR findings as well.  Could also be pulmonary
   edema with hemorrhage due to anticoagulation, HAP with hemorrhage,
   development of ARDS with bleeding for other reasons or from other
   source.  DAH most concerning, particularly in light of prior ARF
   (?renal manifestations), vasculitic rash, elevated ESR.  [**Doctor First Name 1205**] negative,
   ANCA negative
   - Intubate now (larger tube preferred).
   - Bronchoscopy today; looking for progressive or continued blood with
   subsequent BALs.
   - Run recent medication exposures for possible culprits of DAH.
   - Initiate workup for and ?treatment for anti-GBM disease.  Send
   anti-GBM.  ?future renal biopsy.
   - Consult rheumatology and pathology/pheresis.
   - Will increase steroids to 125 mg Q6h, ?further increase if rec by
   rheum.
   - Will discuss cyclophosphamide with rheumatology.
   - ?pheresis today given concern for anti-GBM disease.  Will plan on
   line placement in anticipation of this and/or hemodialysis in near
   future.
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP and send sputum culture.  Will
   discuss with ID re: appropriate regimen (vanc plus beta lactam, ?still
   need to continue cefazolin).
   - Hold heparin, will not give protamine at this time.  WIll given
   vitamin K IV.
   # Hemoptysis
   Evidence, perhaps with purpuric rash, of coagulopathy, or potentially
   as a manifestation of vasculitis. For the former and possibly uremic
   platelets, anticoagulant therapy. In favor of the latter is unifying
   diagnosis and co-occurrence with renal disease and rash.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; trending up now 3.4. Thought to be AIN due to
   Nafcillin.  Now unclear if this is truly manifestation of systemic
   vasculitis or anti-GBM disease.  Has had microscopic hematuria in
   recent past.
   - Resend urine.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - renally dose meds.
   - Change steroid to IV solumedrol.
   - diuresis likely when stabilized, vs. proceeding with HD.
   - ?future renal biopsy.
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or IE. Improving overall.  ?Could be related
   to systemic disease causing DAH.
   - will discuss with derm re: any relation to DAH.
   - steroids as above.
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.  Now on Cefazolin since [**1-22**]
   instead of Vanc as better for MSSA with increased dosing [**1-25**].
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Will continue cefazolin for now, but given would like to treat for
   HAP, will discuss appropriate regimen.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Hold heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia: Guaiac + stools this admission and have nuclear scan
   (negative).  Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely.
   - recheck Hct Q8-Q12.
   - Consented for blood products.
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above.
   - As above, holding heparin.
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently admitted to the ICU for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF) and apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic heart block (CHB), and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient's condition has worsened, with the development of hypoxemic respiratory failure and hemoptysis, which is concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient also has acute on chronic renal failure, leukoclastic dermatitis, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation/complete heart block, anemia, and a history of CAD.

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/50 mmHg to 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and temperature of 36.2°C.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.4 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, creatinine of 3.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen of 25 mg/dL, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, sodium of 138 mEq/L, glucose of 155 mg/dL, and platelet count of 88 K/uL. Coagulation studies reveal a prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR) of 17.6/1.6, and fibrinogen level of 373 mg/dL.

Imaging findings include evidence of line placement and no growth yet in blood cultures. The patient's recent medication exposures include nafcillin, cefazolin, vancomycin, and rifampin.

The assessment and plan involve several concerns, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, hemoptysis, acute on chronic renal failure, leukoclastic dermatitis, bacteremia, atrial fibrillation/complete heart block, anemia, and a history of CAD.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening respiratory failure, continued bleeding, renal failure, systemic vasculitis, and the possibility of anti-GBM disease."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   Concern for immune mediated unifying diagnosis, versus coagulopathy and
   AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. One critical piece of information may
   be whether immune cells cluster at arterioles in skin (vasculitis) or
   around capillaries (AIN and leukoclastic dermatitis proper). This will
   have important implications for treatment. Anti-GBM antibody test will
   be back tomorrow night at earliest per lab/pathologist. Rheumatology
   feel that this likely represents vasculitis and would like to broaden
   treatment to include plasmaphoresis then Cytoxan therapy. This will
   likely depend on whether pathology and Renal also feel that this is a
   vasculitis, not just AIN with associated rash after nafcillin or
   allopurinol. Goodpasture
s unlikely in view of presentation. ANCA is
   negative, but this is the case in about 20% of Wegener
s cases. No
   dysmorphic reds in urine, but this can sometimes be the case. Possible
   other vasculidites, but IgG, IgM and IgA staining in skin were not
   remarkable.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Possible Vasculitis
   Given findings on CXR, CVP, clinical presentation and bronchoscopy,
   likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and fluid overload. ESR
   is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal failure, all
   concerning for vasculitis, although there are other possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and ANCA are negative and anti-GBM is pending. If we seek a unifying
   diagnosis, may be that anti-GBM is negative given skin process.
   Variability in antibody responsible may account for this, and general
   approaches and pathology may eventually be most helpful. Renal biopsy
   is possible (see below). Presently conditions of each organ stabilized
   on high dose steroids, also suggestive. Rheumatology raised Cytoxan
   treatment and plasmaphoresis, but we will need to discuss this further
   with Renal and Pathology.
   - Renal Biopsy this AM
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Await anti-GBM
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology ,Renal , Derm
   - Continue Solu-medrol
   - sp Renal Biopsy, consider Cytoxan and plasmapheresis with d/w Renal
   and Rheumatology
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
   - Hold heparin, ASA
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   # Coagulopathy: Plan for Kidney Biopsy today. INR 1.4 this AM,
   Platelets NL however may be dysfunctional given ASA /Uremia.
   - DDAVP today
   - FFP during procedure
   - One unit platlets.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.8 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Now unclear if this is truly manifestation of systemic
   vasculitis or drug reaction. White cells and eosinophils in urine
   consistent with either, although more classic of AIN.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Management as above, including IV Solu-medrol.
   - Possible renal biopsy tomorrow given that we are now holding
   anticoagulants
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   - FU Derm recommendations
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Hold heparin as above, will restart anticoagulation sp biopsy with
   very low ptt goal.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for
   other sites of blood loss, including GIT
   - Recheck Hct Q8.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Consented for blood products
   - Maintain access and active type and screen
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   - No heparin for now
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - As above, holding heparin.
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   - Consider TEE when stabilized and acute issues under control
 patient
   is actually receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding anti-HTNs in setting of bleeding as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who has undergone CABG and mechanical aortic valve replacement. He is currently hospitalized for MSSA endocarditis with complications including acute renal failure, apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient has been transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation with complete heart block, for which he has a screw-in pacemaker. He also has a history of torsades de pointes, likely secondary to fluoroquinolones. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and bacteremia, as well as for endocarditis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 75 bpm, a blood pressure of 106/54 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate, indicating renal dysfunction. The patient's platelet count is within normal limits, but there may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   Concern for immune mediated unifying diagnosis, versus coagulopathy and
   AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. One critical piece of information may
   be whether immune cells cluster at arterioles in skin (vasculitis) or
   around capillaries (AIN and leukoclastic dermatitis proper). This will
   have important implications for treatment. Anti-GBM antibody test will
   be back tomorrow night at earliest per lab/pathologist. Rheumatology
   feel that this likely represents vasculitis and would like to broaden
   treatment to include plasmaphoresis then Cytoxan therapy. This will
   likely depend on whether pathology and Renal also feel that this is a
   vasculitis, not just AIN with associated rash after nafcillin or
   allopurinol. Goodpasture
s unlikely in view of presentation. ANCA is
   negative, but this is the case in about 20% of Wegener
s cases. No
   dysmorphic reds in urine, but this can sometimes be the case. Possible
   other vasculidites, but IgG, IgM and IgA staining in skin were not
   remarkable.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Possible Vasculitis
   Given findings on CXR, CVP, clinical presentation and bronchoscopy,
   likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and fluid overload. ESR
   is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal failure, all
   concerning for vasculitis, although there are other possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and ANCA are negative and anti-GBM is pending. If we seek a unifying
   diagnosis, may be that anti-GBM is negative given skin process.
   Variability in antibody responsible may account for this, and general
   approaches and pathology may eventually be most helpful. Renal biopsy
   is possible (see below). Presently conditions of each organ stabilized
   on high dose steroids, also suggestive. Rheumatology raised Cytoxan
   treatment and plasmaphoresis, but we will need to discuss this further
   with Renal and Pathology.
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Repeat bronchoscopy today to remove thrombus plugging and examine
   again.
   - Await anti-GBM
   - Discuss renal biopsy
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology and Renal
   - Continue Solu-medrol
   - Consider Cytoxan and plasmapheresis with d/w Renal and Rheumatology
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
 stop
   cefazolin
   - Hold heparin, ASA
   # Hemoptysis and Coagulopathy
   Evidence, perhaps with purpuric rash, of coagulopathy, or potentially
   as a manifestation of vasculitis. For the former and possibly uremic
   platelets, anticoagulant therapy. In favor of the latter is unifying
   diagnosis and co-occurrence with renal disease and rash. See discussion
   above
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 2.1 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Now unclear if this is truly manifestation of systemic
   vasculitis or drug reaction. White cells and eosinophils in urine
   consistent with either, although more classic of AIN.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Management as above, including IV Solu-medrol.
   - Possible renal biopsy tomorrow given that we are now holding
   anticoagulants
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.  Now on Cefazolin since [**1-22**]
   instead of Vanc as better for MSSA with increased dosing [**1-25**].
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Hold heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for
   other sites of blood loss, including GIT
   - Recheck Hct Q8-Q12.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Consented for blood products
   - Maintain access and active type and screen
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for now, knowing high risk with DES.  Minimize time off ASA.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   - No heparin for now
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - As above, holding heparin.
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   - Consider TEE when stabilized and acute issues under control
 patient
   is actually receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding anti-HTNs in setting of bleeding as above.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF recs.
   # Prophylaxis: boots, H2R blocker.
   # Access: PICC, Temporary HD line

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) who is currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis. He has multiple complications including acute renal failure (ARF), apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), congestive heart failure (CHB), torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient is now transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). There is also a concern for immune-mediated unifying diagnosis, coagulopathy, and AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. Rheumatology suggests broadening treatment to include plasmapheresis and Cytoxan therapy. The patient's conditions are stabilized on high-dose steroids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient presents with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). This can lead to severe respiratory compromise and may require mechanical ventilation support.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient shows evidence of coagulopathy, possibly due to a combination of factors such as renal failure, vasculitis, or anticoagulant therapy. This"

   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
   At this time thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema and
   anticoagulation given negative anti-GBM and rather unrevealing renal
   biopsy. ESR is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal
   failure, all concerning for vasculitis, although there are other
   possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and ANCA are negative. Patient clinically improving
   sp diuresis and steroids. HCT stable.
   - FU Renal Biopsy

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis, acute renal failure (ARF), apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), congestive heart failure (CHB), torsades de pointes, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, hemoptysis, and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and was transferred to the MICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis suggest the possibility of DAH. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and renal biopsy findings indicate acute kidney injury superimposed on chronic renal failure. This can progress to further renal dysfunction and require dialysis.
3. Leukocytoclastic Dermatitis: The presence of a purpuric macular rash may indicate leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which can have systemic implications and potentially lead to complications such as renal involvement or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
4. Bacteremia: The patient has a high-grade MSSA bacteremia, which can worsen sepsis and endocarditis if not appropriately managed.
5. Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and complete heart block, along with the screw-in pacemaker, increases the risk of arrhythmias and potential cardiac complications.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia, likely secondary to pulmonary hemorrhage, needs to be closely monitored and managed to maintain adequate oxygen carrying capacity.
7. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient's underlying CAD, with previous CABG and drug-eluting stents, poses a risk for increased thrombosis if anticoagulation therapy is resumed.
8. Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR): The patient's PT/INR should be closely monitored due to the combination of endocarditis, mechanical valve replacement, and anticoagulation therapy, which increases the risk of bleeding and thrombosis.
9. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension needs to be managed carefully to avoid exacerbating end-organ damage and complications.
10. Infection Control: Strict adherence to infection control measures is crucial to prevent the spread of MSSA and other potential infections in the ICU setting."

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   Concern for immune mediated unifying diagnosis, versus coagulopathy and
   AIN with leukoclastic dermatitis. One critical piece of information may
   be whether immune cells cluster at arterioles in skin (vasculitis) or
   around capillaries (AIN and leukoclastic dermatitis proper). This will
   have important implications for treatment. Anti-GBM antibody test will
   be back tomorrow night at earliest per lab/pathologist. Rheumatology
   feel that this likely represents vasculitis and would like to broaden
   treatment to include plasmaphoresis then Cytoxan therapy. This will
   likely depend on whether pathology and Renal also feel that this is a
   vasculitis, not just AIN with associated rash after nafcillin or
   allopurinol. Goodpasture
s unlikely in view of presentation. ANCA is
   negative, but this is the case in about 20% of Wegener
s cases. No
   dysmorphic reds in urine, but this can sometimes be the case. Possible
   other vasculidites, but IgG, IgM and IgA staining in skin were not
   remarkable.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and Possible Vasculitis
   Given findings on CXR, CVP, clinical presentation and bronchoscopy,
   likely secondary to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and fluid overload. ESR
   is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal failure, all
   concerning for vasculitis, although there are other possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**]
   and ANCA are negative and anti-GBM is pending. If we seek a unifying
   diagnosis, may be that anti-GBM is negative given skin process.
   Variability in antibody responsible may account for this, and general
   approaches and pathology may eventually be most helpful. Renal biopsy
   is possible (see below). Presently conditions of each organ stabilized
   on high dose steroids, also suggestive. Rheumatology raised Cytoxan
   treatment and plasmaphoresis, but we will need to discuss this further
   with Renal and Pathology.
   - Renal Biopsy this AM
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Await anti-GBM
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology ,Renal , Derm
   - Continue Solu-medrol
   - sp Renal Biopsy, consider Cytoxan and plasmapheresis with d/w Renal
   and Rheumatology
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
   - Hold heparin, ASA
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   # Coagulopathy: Plan for Kidney Biopsy today. INR 1.4 this AM,
   Platelets NL however may be dysfunctional given ASA /Uremia.
   - DDAVP today
   - FFP during procedure
   - One unit platlets.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.8 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Now unclear if this is truly manifestation of systemic
   vasculitis or drug reaction. White cells and eosinophils in urine
   consistent with either, although more classic of AIN.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts re: renal manifestation as above.
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Management as above, including IV Solu-medrol.
   - Possible renal biopsy tomorrow given that we are now holding
   anticoagulants
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   - FU Derm recommendations
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Hold heparin as above, will restart anticoagulation sp biopsy with
   very low ptt goal.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, mechanical aortic valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and recent hospitalization for MSSA endocarditis. He presented with acute respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The patient also has renal failure, leukoclastic dermatitis, bacteremia with MSSA, atrial fibrillation with complete heart block, anemia, and a history of coronary artery bypass grafting. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis suggest the possibility of DAH. This is a serious condition that can lead to respiratory failure and requires prompt management.
2. Vasculitis: The presence of a purpuric macular rash, elevated ESR, renal failure, and negative ANCA and anti-GBM antibodies raise concerns for a vasculitis-related process. It is essential to determine the underlying cause of these symptoms and initiate appropriate treatment.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and platelet dysfunction may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and management of coagulation parameters are necessary.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AIN): The patient's worsening renal function and presence of eosinophils in"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
   At this time thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema and
   anticoagulation given negative anti-GBM and rather unrevealing renal
   biopsy. ESR is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal
   failure, all concerning for vasculitis, although there are other
   possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and ANCA are negative. Patient clinically improving
   sp diuresis and steroids. HCT stable.
   - FU Renal Biopsy
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology ,Renal , Derm
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
   - Restart Heparin this AM, no bolus. PTT goal 50-70,
   - Hold ASA until tomorrow
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   - Continue lower dose steroids at this time.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.6 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Renal biopsy without changes consistent with AIN, may be
   secondary to immune complex deposition in the setting of endocarditis.
   Awaiting immunostaining currently.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Lower Dose steroids at this time, however will follow up with renal
   regarding further treatment.
   - FU biopsy results
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   - FU Derm recommendations
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - restart heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for
   other sites of blood loss, including GIT
   - Recheck Hct Q8.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Consented for blood products
   - Maintain access and active type and screen
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for until tomorrow, knowing high risk with DES.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   - Heparin as above.
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - Heparin as above, transition to coumadin if possible
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.

   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
   At this time thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema and
   anticoagulation given negative anti-GBM and rather unrevealing renal
   biopsy. ESR is elevated, there is a pupruic macular rash and renal
   failure, all concerning for vasculitis, although there are other
   possibilities. [**Doctor First Name 1205**] and ANCA are negative. Patient clinically improving
   sp diuresis and steroids. HCT stable.
   - FU Renal Biopsy
   - Maintain intubation for now given lesser chance of hemorrhage without
   cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology ,Renal , Derm
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP
 cefepime and vancomycin
   - Restart Heparin this AM, no bolus. PTT goal 50-70,
   - Hold ASA until tomorrow
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   - Continue lower dose steroids at this time.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.6 s/p CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below).  Renal biopsy without changes consistent with AIN, may be
   secondary to immune complex deposition in the setting of endocarditis.
   Awaiting immunostaining currently.
   - f/u renal recs, discuss thoughts
   - Renally dose/CVVH dose meds.
   - Lower Dose steroids at this time, however will follow up with renal
   regarding further treatment.
   - FU biopsy results
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Thought due to Nafcillin or allopurinol. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Steroids as above.
   - FU Derm recommendations
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommend
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures.
   - Based on ID input will cover this and possible HAP with vancomycin
   and cefepime.
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - restart heparin as above.
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If diffuse vasculitis or actually
   secondary to primary coagulopathy then need to maintain suspicion for
   other sites of blood loss, including GIT
   - Recheck Hct Q8.
   - Guaiac stool
   - Consented for blood products
   - Maintain access and active type and screen
   - H2 blocker given some concern that PPI could be causing AIN.
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin.
   - Hold ASA for until tomorrow, knowing high risk with DES.
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure.
   - Holding BB for now.
   - Heparin as above.
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - Heparin as above, transition to coumadin if possible
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   - Consider TEE when stabilized and acute issues under control
 patient
   is actually receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding anti-HTNs in setting of bleeding as above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications such as acute renal failure (ARF), apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic heart block (CHB), torsades de pointes, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis. The patient is now in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient's 24-hour events include a negative anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) test, serial hematocrit levels, renal biopsy without significant inflammation, change to methylprednisolone, restart of heparin, and continuation of other medications. The patient's vital signs and lab results are also provided.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis are concerning for DAH. The cause is thought to be secondary to pulmonary edema and anticoagulation given the negative anti-GBM and rather unrevealing renal biopsy. ESR is elevated, there is a purpuric macular rash, and renal failure, all"

   Imaging: Asymmetric, severe pulmonary hemorrhage, both lungs,

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation
   Maintain intubation and ventilation for now given copious secretions
   this a.m. If production decreases then will consider extubation because
   there is no other reason to maintain vent. Hypoxemic respiratory
   failure has largely resolved - was likely due to pulmonary edema and
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving sp diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - FU Renal Biopsy
   - Maintain intubation for now given secretions and lesser chance of
   hemorrhage without cough and management of respiratory parameters.
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology (want to taper
   steroids), Renal (steroids for AIN only), Dermatology (topical
   steroid).
   - Broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context of AVR
   cefepime and vancomycin
   - Restart Heparin this AM, no bolus. PTT goal 50-70
   - Hold ASA for now.
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   - Continue lower dose steroids at this time, 40 mg today and 30 mg
   tomorrow for course of treatment for AIN (check with Renal but in order
   of four weeks)
   #. Hemoptysis
   Discussion above pertains. Likely little further benefit and possible
   harm, so hold bronchoscopy for now.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.2 on CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below), although allopurinal and warfarin can also less

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, post-coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and post-mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF) and apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic hemodialysis (CHB), torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy. The patient was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) due to respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).

The patient's medical history includes atrial fibrillation (AF) with complete heart block (CHB), for which a screw-in pacemaker was placed. The patient is currently receiving ventricular pacing.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 128/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 13.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) of 9.6 g/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 39 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 139 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.1 mEq/L, and platelet count (Plt) of 292 K/uL. The patient's coagulation profile shows a prothrombin time (PT) of 14.7 seconds, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 53.3 seconds, and international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3.

The patient's imaging studies reveal asymmetric, severe pulmonary hemorrhage in both lungs, previously improved but now stable since January 28th. The patient's renal biopsy shows no changes consistent with vasculitis or RPGN.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, cefepime, heparin, fentanyl, calcium gluconate (continuous renal replacement therapy - CRRT), potassium chloride (CRRT), and midazolam. The patient is also receiving famotidine, fentanyl, midazolam, and steroids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH): The patient presents with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and hemoptysis, which are concerning for DAH. The asymmetric, severe pulmonary hemorrhage seen on imaging studies supports this possibility. The etiology of the hemorrhage is unclear, with differential diagnoses including vasculitic and autoimmune processes, coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of coagulopathy. Further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause.

2. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (ACRF)/AIN: The patient has a history of chronic hemodialysis (CH"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation
   Maintain intubation and ventilation for now given continued secretions
   during the day yesterday. Secretions had improved throughout the night,
   and can consider extubation later this pm. Hypoxemic respiratory
   failure has largely resolved - was likely due to pulmonary edema and
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Continue to follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - SBT and consider extubation this PM given improved secretions and
   lesser chance of hemorrhage without cough and management of respiratory
   parameters
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology (want to taper
   steroids), Renal (steroids for AIN only), Dermatology (topical
   steroid).
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Continue Heparin gtt with PTT goal 50-70
   - Hold ASA for now given bloody secretions; can likely restart today
   - Continue to remove fluid with CVVH
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN (will check with Renal, but
   likely will need for 4 weeks; start date [**2-1**])
   #. Hemoptysis
   Discussion above pertains. Likely little further benefit and possible
   harm, so hold bronchoscopy for now.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.2 on CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below), although Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less
   frequently (and much less likely in this case) produce this effect.
   Renal biopsy without changes consistent with AIN, but already given a
   few days of high-dose steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results
   and evaluation. Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened
   renal function and urinary eosinophils.
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN (will check with Renal, but
   likely will need for 4 weeks; start date [**2-1**])
   - Continue to renally dose medications

   #. Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of said coagulopathy. Will need
   to monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks.
   Likely too bloody for vasculitic cause.

   vasculitis on biopsy) (also send UA but may not be helpful for the same
   reason).

 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Copious secretions in the morning with blood, like Framboise Lambic,
   then cleared and reduced later over the day
   - Very comfortable on vent and lightly sedated
   - Continue 30 mg prednisone for AIN
   - Continued heparin with goal PTT 50-60 given St. Jude valve (wanted to
   see if bleeding might stop on this low level of anticoagulation given
   risk of valve)
   - No more pathology
   - Rheum. want taper of steroids, and will likely be happy with AIN
   level treatment.
   - CVVH at 380 this a.m. with 4.7 L off yesterday (Renal want us to
   continue to take off until pressure drops or labs contract given
   possible role of pulmonary edema in DAH).

 Final read pending; Multifocal opacification stable to
   improved by our read
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; currently hospitalized
   for MSSA endocarditis with complications of ARF and apparent AIN, CHB
   and torsades, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis on skin biopsy, now
   transferred to MICU with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and
   hemoptysis concerning for DAH.
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation
   Maintain intubation and ventilation for now given continued secretions
   during the day yesterday. Secretions had improved throughout the night,
   and can consider extubation later this pm. Hypoxemic respiratory
   failure has largely resolved - was likely due to pulmonary edema and
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Continue to follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - SBT and consider extubation this PM given improved secretions and
   lesser chance of hemorrhage without cough and management of respiratory
   parameters
   - Continue to appreciate input of Rheumatology (want to taper
   steroids), Renal (steroids for AIN only), Dermatology (topical
   steroid).
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Continue Heparin gtt with PTT goal 50-70
   - Hold ASA for now given secretions
   - Plan to discontinue CVVH
 will need to get in touch with Renal
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN (will check with Renal, but
   likely will need for 4 weeks; start date [**2-1**])
   # Volume Status
   Patient appears overall volume depleted on exam findings. This explains
   hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan to discontinue CVVH
 will need to get in touch with Renal
   - Trend fever curve
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow
   #. Hemoptysis
   Discussion above pertains. Likely little further benefit and possible
   harm, so hold bronchoscopy for now.
   #. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr 1.5 on presentation; up to 3.4, now 1.2 on CVVH. DDx includes AIN
   due to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below), although Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less
   frequently (and much less likely in this case) produce this effect.
   Renal biopsy without changes consistent with AIN, but already given a
   few days of high-dose steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results
   and evaluation. Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened
   renal function and urinary eosinophils.
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN (will check with Renal, but
   likely will need for 4 weeks; start date [**2-1**])
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Plan to discontinue CVVH
 will need to get in touch with Renal
   - Continue to follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow urine output
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations
   #. Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of said coagulopathy. Will need
   to monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks.
   Likely too bloody for vasculitic cause.
   - Ask Renal if benefit to spinning when so frankly bloody (surely not
   just due to vasculitis given amount, precipitant (biopsy), and no
   vasculitis on biopsy) (also send UA but may not be helpful for the same
   reason).
   - Continue to follow urine output and if hematuria
   - Consider irrigation if reduction in urine output, suprapubic pain or
   residual volume
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Is recovering. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. Improving overall. See
   discussion above for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above.
   - Continue to follow Derm recommendations
   #. Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue to repeat blood cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   History this admission of CHB (as well as torsades, thought due to
   FQs), now s/p screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly
   pacing.
   - Continue Heparin as above
   - EP following - plan for 2 months of this pacer before likely
   permanent pacer.
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable. Now with pulmonary hemorrhage likely. If
   diffuse vasculitis or actually secondary to primary coagulopathy then
   need to maintain suspicion for other sites of blood loss, including GI
   tract. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit q8
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S
   - Continue Protonix while being aware that PPI may also cause AIN
   # CAD
   S/p CABG and with DES x3 in one graft. Given coagulopathy, is off
   anticoagulants. [**Month (only) 60**] be some concern for increased thrombosis risk in
   coming days, but have not choice given severity of presentation. We
   will need to revisit this when diagnosis is cleared and natural history
   of this presentation clearer.
   - Continue statin
   - Hold ASA for now given bloody secretions
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure
   - Holding BB for now
   - Continue Heparin as above
   #. s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF).
   - Heparin as above, transition to coumadin if possible
   - CT surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess.
   - Consider TEE when stabilized and acute issues under control
 patient
   is actually receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   #. Hypertension.
   - Holding anti-HTNs in setting of bleeding as above.
   #. Hyperglycemia
   In the context of steroids. When stabilized on 30 mg prednisone daily
   will adjust for tighter control.
   #. Mental Status
   Lightly sedated. Will lighten slightly further today.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, TF recs.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He is currently hospitalized for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with complications of acute renal failure (ARF), apparent acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), torsades de pointes, and leukocytoclastic dermatitis.
- The patient is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Secretions have improved throughout the night, and the possibility of extubation later this pm is being considered.
- The patient has a fever and is showing signs of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). The etiology of the hemorrhage is unclear, with possible causes including vasculitis, coagulopathy, or pulmonary edema. Investigations for vasculitis have been relatively unimpressive, and the possibility of worsened MR and pulmonary edema is unlikely given the echo three days ago.
- The patient's renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 1.2. He is currently on continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) and will likely need to discontinue it soon.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   - Renal biopsy results continue to be pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; admitted with MSSA
   bacteremia c/b CHB (s/p temp wire) as well as torsades; complicated
   with ARF likely secondary to AIN currently managed with CVVH and likely
   HD starting today, multifactorial DAH currently stable off extubation,
   leukocytoclastic vasculitis on legs currently improving.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr, BUN and bicarbonate all suggestive of progressively worsening renal
   function. Also with large diuresis off diuretics. DDx includes AIN due
   to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
   see below), although Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less frequently
   (and much less likely in this case) produce this effect. Renal biopsy
   without changes consistent with AIN, but already given a few days of
   high-dose steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results and
   evaluation. Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened renal
   function and urinary eosinophils.
   - Obtain urine electrolytes
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Continue to follow Vancomycin trough
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN per Renal recommendations
   will likely need for 4-6 weeks; start date [**2-1**]
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Continue to follow UOP
   - Follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Volume Status
   CVVH discontinued [**2-1**] as patient appeared volume depleted on exam. He
   continues to have large UOP, likely contributing to his continued
   hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Trend fever curve
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation/Hemoptysis
   Stable s/p extubation. Secretion quantity has improved throughout past
   2 days and seems to be stable off of positive pressure from ventilator.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period
 can plan to
   restart CVVH or emergent HD pending renal recommendations today should
   such an event occur. Hypoxemic respiratory failure has largely resolved
   - was likely due to pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear and likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Obtain CXR this AM
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent CVVH /HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of coagulopathy. Will need to
   monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks. Likely
   too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears overall to be improving
   per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there is a benefit to
   spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may consider
   irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine output,
   suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S (current outdates [**2-2**])
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   CHB this admission (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p
   screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly pacing.  EP is
   following and current plan is for 2 months of this temporary pacer
   prior to placing permanent pacer.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Continue to follow EP recommendations; appreciate their input;
   # s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF). Can consider CT
   surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess. Consider TEE when patient further stabilized and acute issues
   under control
 patient is receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Transition to coumadin when possible
   # CAD
   s/p CABG with DES x3 in one graft. Have restarted anticoagulation given
   the concern for increased thrombosis risk.
   - Continue Heparin as above
   - Consider restarting ASA given stable Hct
   - Continue statin
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure
   - Holding BB in the setting of bleed as above
   # Hypertension.

   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; admitted with MSSA
   bacteremia c/b CHB (s/p temp wire) as well as torsades; complicated
   with ARF likely secondary to AIN currently managed with CVVH and likely
   HD starting today, multifactorial DAH currently stable off extubation,
   leukocytoclastic vasculitis on legs currently improving.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr, BUN and bicarbonate all suggestive of progressively worsening renal
   function. Also with large diuresis off diuretics. DDx includes AIN due
   to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash

   - Obtain urine electrolytes
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Continue to follow Vancomycin trough
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN per Renal recommendations
   will likely need for 4-6 weeks; start date [**2-1**]
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Continue to follow UOP
   - Follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Volume Status
   CVVH discontinued [**2-1**] as patient appeared volume depleted on exam. He
   continues to have large UOP, likely contributing to his continued
   hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Trend fever curve
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation/Hemoptysis
   Stable s/p extubation. Secretion quantity has improved throughout past
   2 days and seems to be stable off of positive pressure from ventilator.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period
 can plan to
   restart CVVH or emergent HD pending renal recommendations today should
   such an event occur. Hypoxemic respiratory failure has largely resolved
   - was likely due to pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Obtain CXR this AM
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent CVVH /HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime and Vancomycin
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of coagulopathy. Will need to
   monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks. Likely
   too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears overall to be improving
   per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there is a benefit to
   spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may consider
   irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine output,
   suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S
   - Continue Protonix while being aware that PPI may also cause AIN

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), and currently admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute renal failure likely secondary to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The patient also has a history of torsades de pointes, which was thought to be due to fluoroquinolones (FQs), and a leukocytoclastic vasculitis on the legs that is currently improving.

The patient's current condition includes worsening BUN, creatinine, and bicarbonate levels, indicating progressively worsening renal function. He is managed with continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVH) and is planned for possible hemodialysis (HD) today per renal recommendations. The patient's volume status is also discussed, with a plan for possible HD today and the discontinuation of CVVH due to the patient appearing volume depleted on exam.

The patient has been extubated successfully and is stable off extubation. His secretions have improved throughout the past two days and seem to be stable without positive pressure from the ventilator. However, there is concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period, so CVVH or emergent HD may be restarted pending renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; admitted with MSSA
   bacteremia c/b CHB (s/p temp wire) as well as torsades; complicated
   with ARF likely secondary to AIN currently managed with CVVH and likely
   HD starting today, multifactorial DAH currently stable off extubation,
   leukocytoclastic vasculitis on legs currently improving.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr, BUN and bicarbonate all suggestive of progressively worsening renal
   function. DDx includes AIN due to Nafcillin (also identical
   pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below), although
   Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less frequently (and much less likely
   in this case) produce this effect. Renal biopsy without changes
   consistent with AIN, but already given a few days of high-dose
   steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results and evaluation.
   Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened renal function and
   urinary eosinophils.
   - Obtain urine electrolytes
   - Plan for HD today with Renal
   - Continue to follow Vancomycin trough
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN per Renal recommendations; will
   plan to taper (start date [**2-1**]; 5 days 30mg, 5 days 20mg, 5 days 10mg)
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Continue to follow UOP
   - Follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Volume Status
   CVVH discontinued [**2-1**] as patient appeared volume depleted on exam. He
   still had large volume out from CVVH yesterday, likely contributing to
   his continued hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Trend fever curve
   - Obtain UA
   - Follow up blood cultures; obtain blood cultures today
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation/Hemoptysis
   Stable s/p extubation. Secretion quantity has improved throughout past
   2 days and seems to be stable off of positive pressure from ventilator.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period
 can plan to
   restart CVVH or emergent HD pending renal recommendations today should
   such an event occur. Hypoxemic respiratory failure has largely resolved
   - was likely due to pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear and likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Obtain CXR this AM
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent CVVH /HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of coagulopathy. Will need to
   monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks. Likely
   too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears overall to be improving
   per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there is a benefit to
   spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may consider
   irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine output,
   suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S (current outdates [**2-2**])
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   CHB this admission (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p
   screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly pacing.  EP is
   following and current plan is for 2 months of this temporary pacer
   prior to placing permanent pacer.

   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Transition to coumadin when possible
   # CAD
   s/p CABG with DES x3 in one graft. Have restarted anticoagulation given
   the concern for increased thrombosis risk.
   - Continue Heparin as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and acute kidney injury (AKI). The patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. He also experienced a bleeding event leading to hemodynamic instability and required transfusions. The patient's renal function has progressively worsened, and he is currently on continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with planned hemodialysis (HD) today. His condition is improving, but there are still concerns about potential complications such as flash pulmonary edema, worsening renal failure, and bacteremia/endocarditis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient has a history of ARDS and recent improvement in respiratory status. However, there is a possibility of flash pulmonary edema, especially if the patient develops hypotension or shows signs of fluid overload.
2. Worsening Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has progressively worsened, and he is currently on CVVH. There is a concern for further deterioration in renal function, which may require emergent HD.
3. Bacteremia/Endocarditis: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and a mechanical AVR"

   - CXR appears improved on left, slight prominence of opacity on right
   - No new culture data
   - Renal biopsy results continue to be pending
   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; admitted with MSSA
   bacteremia c/b CHB (s/p temp wire) as well as torsades; complicated
   with ARF likely secondary to AIN currently managed with CVVH and likely
   HD starting today, multifactorial DAH currently stable off extubation,
   leukocytoclastic vasculitis on legs currently improving.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr, BUN and bicarbonate all suggestive of progressively worsening renal
   function. Also with large diuresis off diuretics. DDx includes AIN due
   to Nafcillin (also identical pathophysiology with concomitant rash
   see below), although Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less frequently
   (and much less likely in this case) produce this effect. Renal biopsy
   without changes consistent with AIN, but already given a few days of
   high-dose steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results and
   evaluation. Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened renal
   function and urinary eosinophils.
   - Obtain urine electrolytes
   - Plan for HD today with Renal
   - Continue to follow Vancomycin trough
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN per Renal recommendations; will
   plan to taper (start date [**2-1**]; 5 days 30mg, 5 days 20mg, 5 days 10mg)
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Continue to follow UOP
   - Follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Volume Status
   CVVH discontinued [**2-1**] as patient appeared volume depleted on exam. He
   continues to have large UOP, likely contributing to his continued
   hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Trend fever curve
   - Follow up blood cultures; obtain blood cultures today
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation/Hemoptysis
   Stable s/p extubation. Secretion quantity has improved throughout past
   2 days and seems to be stable off of positive pressure from ventilator.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period
 can plan to
   restart CVVH or emergent HD pending renal recommendations today should
   such an event occur. Hypoxemic respiratory failure has largely resolved
   - was likely due to pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear and likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Obtain CXR this AM
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent CVVH /HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of coagulopathy. Will need to
   monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks. Likely
   too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears overall to be improving
   per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there is a benefit to
   spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may consider
   irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine output,
   suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S (current outdates [**2-2**])
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   CHB this admission (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p
   screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly pacing.  EP is
   following and current plan is for 2 months of this temporary pacer
   prior to placing permanent pacer.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Continue to follow EP recommendations; appreciate their input;
   # s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF). Can consider CT
   surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess. Consider TEE when patient further stabilized and acute issues
   under control
 patient is receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Transition to coumadin when possible
   # CAD
   s/p CABG with DES x3 in one graft. Have restarted anticoagulation given
   the concern for increased thrombosis risk.
   - Continue Heparin as above
   - Consider restarting ASA given stable Hct; likely tomorrow, [**2-3**]
   - Continue statin
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure
   - Holding BB in the setting of bleed as above

","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AFib), who was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia secondary to central venous catheter infection and torsades de pointes. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure likely due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), multifactorial diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure of 258/255 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and stable.

The patient's laboratory results show worsening BUN, creatinine, and bicarbonate levels, indicating progressive renal dysfunction. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and platelet count. Blood cultures have shown persistent MSSA bacteremia, and the patient has been treated with cefepime and vancomycin. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels.

The patient's chest X-ray shows improvement on the left side but a slight prominence of opacity on the right side. Renal biopsy results are"

   initially thought most likely, given renal failure, rash and pulmonary
   hemorrhage, but investigations for this have been relatively
   unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM
   and unimpressive pathology of skin and kidney, although the final read
   of the latter is pending. Patient clinically improving s/p diuresis and
   steroids and HCT stable. Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper
   steroids to level for treatment of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not
   be positive in early disease and should be repeated in three to four
   weeks. Possibility of worsened MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely
   given echo three days ago.
   - Follow CXR
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukocytoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   Stable. High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major,
   3 minor) for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but
   sensitivity likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID
   recommends antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from
   Nafcillin/Rifampin to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Stable/improving. Likely secondary to biopsy in context of
   coagulopathy. Will need to monitor given danger period following biopsy
   is about two weeks. Likely too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears
   overall to be improving per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there
   is a benefit to spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may
   consider irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine
   output, suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S (current outdates [**2-2**])
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   CHB this admission (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p
   screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly pacing.  EP is
   following and current plan is for 2 months of this temporary pacer
   prior to placing permanent pacer.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60; transition to coumadin when more
   certain hemoptysis/hematuria resolving
   - Continue to follow EP recommendations; appreciate their input;
   # s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF). Can consider CT
   surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess. Consider TEE when patient further stabilized and acute issues
   under control
 patient is receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60; transition to coumadin when more
   certain hemoptysis/hematuria resolving
   # CAD
   s/p CABG with DES x3 in one graft. Have restarted anticoagulation given
   the concern for increased thrombosis risk.
   - Continue Heparin as above
   - Consider restarting ASA in 48 hours on [**2-5**]
   - Continue statin
   - Holding ACE in the setting of renal failure
   - Holding BB in the setting of bleed as above
   # Hypertension.
   - Holding antihypertensives in the setting of bleed as above
   # Hyperglycemia
   - ISS in the context of steroids
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes prn, thin liquids at this time;

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), s/p coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and was found to have torsades de pointes. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

The patient's current vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), current temperature 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate 75 bpm, blood pressure 129/75 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% on nasal cannula. The patient is extubated and showing improvement.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient also has an elevated troponin T level, but it is below the critical value. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level.

The patient's chest X-ray shows no acute changes, and the most recent"

The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain during dialysis. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 129/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is extubated and showing signs of respiratory distress, including rales and rhonchi. He also has a petechial rash on his lower extremities.

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, bacteremia, hyperglycemia, and renal failure. He has elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. His electrolyte levels are within normal limits, but he has elevated blood glucose levels. Other lab results show elevated levels of lactate, LDH, and troponin T, indicating possible myocardial injury. Imaging studies reveal pneumonia and evidence of bacterial endocarditis.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with hyperglycemia, anemia, bacteremia, hemoptysis, hospital-acquired pneumonia, bacterial endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and hypotension. The patient is currently receiving ICU care, including dialysis, arterial line, and PICC line. He is"

   Assessment and Plan
   76M with CAD s/p CABG, s/p mechanical AVR, Afib; admitted with MSSA
   bacteremia c/b CHB (s/p temp wire) as well as torsades; complicated
   with ARF likely secondary to AIN currently managed with CVVH and likely
   HD starting today, multifactorial DAH currently stable off extubation,
   leukocytoclastic vasculitis on legs currently improving.
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure/AIN
   Cr, BUN and bicarbonate all suggestive of progressively worsening renal
   function. DDx includes AIN due to Nafcillin (also identical
   pathophysiology with concomitant rash
 see below), although
   Allopurinol and Warfarin can also less frequently (and much less likely
   in this case) produce this effect. Renal biopsy without changes
   consistent with AIN, but already given a few days of high-dose
   steroids. Awaiting final renal pathology results and evaluation.
   Evidence for AIN includes white cell casts, worsened renal function and
   urinary eosinophils.
   - Obtain urine electrolytes
   - Plan for HD today with Renal
   - Continue to follow Vancomycin trough
   - Continue Prednisone 30mg to treat AIN per Renal recommendations; will
   plan to taper (start date [**2-1**]; 5 days 30mg, 5 days 20mg, 5 days 10mg)
   - Continue to renally dose medications
   - Continue to follow UOP
   - Follow up renal biopsy results from [**1-29**]
   - Continue to follow Renal recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Volume Status
   CVVH discontinued [**2-1**] as patient appeared volume depleted on exam. He
   still had large volume out from CVVH yesterday, likely contributing to
   his continued hemoconcentration seen on lab values.
   - Plan for possible HD today per Renal recommendations
   - Trend fever curve
   - Obtain UA
   - Follow up blood cultures; obtain blood cultures today
   # DAH/Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure/Ventilation/Intubation/Hemoptysis
   Stable s/p extubation. Secretion quantity has improved throughout past
   2 days and seems to be stable off of positive pressure from ventilator.
   Concern for flash pulmonary edema during this period
 can plan to
   restart CVVH or emergent HD pending renal recommendations today should
   such an event occur. Hypoxemic respiratory failure has largely resolved
   - was likely due to pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.
   The etiology of hemorrhage is unclear and likely multifactorial.
   Differential diagnoses include vasculitic and autoimmune processes,
   coagulopathy, or the effect of pulmonary edema in the context of
   coagulopathy. Vaculitis was initially thought most likely, given renal
   failure, rash and pulmonary hemorrhage, but investigations for this
   have been relatively unimpressive: ESR from 15 to 100s now, but
   negative [**Doctor First Name 1205**], ANCA, anti-GBM and unimpressive pathology of skin and
   kidney, although the final read of the latter is pending. Patient
   clinically improving s/p diuresis and steroids and HCT stable.
   Vasculitis now unlikely enough to taper steroids to level for treatment
   of AIN along. Nonetheless, ANCA may not be positive in early disease
   and should be repeated in three to four weeks. Possibility of worsened
   MR and pulmonary edema, but unlikely given echo three days ago.
   - Obtain CXR this AM
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Continue to follow secretions on Heparin
   - Consider emergent CVVH /HD in the event of flash pulmonary edema
   - Continue to follow Rheumatology, Renal, Dermatology, ID
   recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Leukoclastic Dermatitis
   Overall improving. Thought to be due to Nafcillin or Allopurinol
 case
   reports of Warfarin also, but much less likely. See discussion above
   for relationship to unifying diagnosis.
   - Continue steroids as above
   - Continue to follow Dermatology recommendations; appreciate their
   input
   # Bacteremia
   High-grade MSSA bacteremia and fulfils Duke Criteria (1 Major, 3 minor)
   for endocarditis. TTE did not reveal vegetations, but sensitivity
   likely low. Nonetheless, given AVR and concern, ID recommends
   antibiotics for a full 8 week course. Switched from Nafcillin/Rifampin
   to Vancomycin [**1-17**] due to question of AIN.
   - Continue broad spectrum treatment for HAP, MSSA bacteremia in context
   of AVR
 Cefepime (start date [**1-27**], 8 days total) and Vancomycin (start
   date [**1-7**], 8 weeks total per ID recommendations)
   - Follow up blood cultures
   - Continue to follow ID recommendations; appreciate their input
   # Hematuria
   Likely secondary to biopsy in context of coagulopathy. Will need to
   monitor given danger period following biopsy is about two weeks. Likely
   too bloody for vasculitic etiologic. Appears overall to be improving
   per nursing. [**Month (only) 60**] consider asking Renal if there is a benefit to
   spinning urine when it is so frankly bloody. Also, may consider
   irrigation for blood clots if there is a reduction in urine output,
   suprapubic pain or residual volume.
   - Continue to follow UOP/hematuria on Heparin
   # Anemia
   Hematocrit has been stable to high likely secondary to
   hemoconcentration. Patient is consented for blood products.
   - Continue to check Hematocrit [**Hospital1 **]
   - Guaiac stool
   - Continue to maintain active T&S (current outdates [**2-2**])
   # Atrial Fibrillation/Complete Heart Block
   CHB this admission (as well as torsades, thought due to FQs), now s/p
   screw-in pacemaker that is presently ventricularly pacing.  EP is
   following and current plan is for 2 months of this temporary pacer
   prior to placing permanent pacer.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Continue to follow EP recommendations; appreciate their input;
   # s/p AVR (St. [**Male First Name (un) 6198**]).  Endocarditis as above. Goal for INR [**2-18**], but
   likely higher in this patient given other risks (AF). Can consider CT
   surgery consult if clinical condition worsens and concerning for
   abscess. Consider TEE when patient further stabilized and acute issues
   under control
 patient is receiving appropriate treatment now anyway.
   - Continue Heparin gtt PTT goal 50-60
   - Transition to coumadin when possible
   # CAD
   s/p CABG with DES x3 in one graft. Have restarted anticoagulation given
   the concern for increased thrombosis risk.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), s/p coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR). He was admitted with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient has multiple comorbidities including acute kidney injury (AKI), diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and atrial fibrillation with complete heart block (AF/CHB). He is currently receiving treatment for MSSA bacteremia, HAP, and AIN. The patient's condition is improving, with stable vital signs and improved respiratory status. However, there are concerns about potential complications such as flash pulmonary edema, worsening MR, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's medical team is monitoring his progress closely and adjusting treatment accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Flash Pulmonary Edema: The patient's history of CHF and recent improvement in respiratory status may put him at risk for flash pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is essential.
2. Worsening Mitral Regurgitation (MR): The patient's history of AF/CHB and previous AVR surgery may lead to worsening MR. Regular echocardiograms and close monitoring of cardiac function are necessary.
3. Pulmonary Embolism"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), atrial fibrillation (AF), and infective endocarditis. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications including acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), multifactorial diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), leukocytoclastic vasculitis, MSSA bacteremia, hematuria, anemia, and atrial fibrillation with complete heart block.

Summary:
- The patient experienced chest pain during dialysis, which resolved when dialysis was stopped.
- The patient has a history of CAD, CABG, AVR, AF, and infective endocarditis.
- The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia and endocarditis.
- The patient has ARF likely secondary to AIN, and is being managed with continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) and may start with hemodialysis (HD) today.
- The patient has DAH, which is improving, but the etiology is unclear and may be multifactorial.
- The patient has leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is improving.
- The patient's renal function is improving, but renal biopsy results are pending.
- The patient is stable off"
