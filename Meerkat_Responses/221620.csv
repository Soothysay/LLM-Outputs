 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   .
   # Respiratory failure.  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurances).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis.
   - Continue vent at current settings overnight.
   - Would strongly consider more definitive airway management to both
   prevent further tracheal injury with repeated intubations, and bypass
   stenosed area if NPPE playing a role.  Will discuss tomorrow with
   ENT/[**Doctor Last Name 4311**] and IP/[**Doctor Last Name 4950**].  Will keep NPO in case able to do tomorrow.
   - Try to obtain further information re: enzyme or ECG changes with
   acute episodes; also obtain recent cath if any (from St Vincents) and
   recent stress (from PCP) and recent TTE (from [**Hospital1 4942**]).
   - CXR now to eval tube placement.
   - ECG and check cardiac enzymes.  Check BNP.
   - Consider Aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage
   without trach.
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - CXR.
   - Check BNP.
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patinet and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket.
   - Hold on specific abx treatment for now.
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - Ceftriaxone for now.  Resend UA and culture.  Consider broadening as
   has been in hospital a lot recently.
   - Check with OSH tomorrow re: culture update.
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain TTE results if really was performed today at OSH.
   - BB.  Hold ACE given ?allergy as above.
   - Lasix 40 IV BID for now, goal 1L neg in next 24 hours.  Mildly volume
   up.
   - Check BNP and CXR.
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - Statin.
   - ASA for now ?need to hold for trach.
   - Obtain cath, echo, stress reports as above.
   .
   # Afib.  Currently mostly A paced on tele.  Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on AC for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as abov.e
   - Clarify AC plans.
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.
   - Ativan prn for now.
   - Risk for BZ withdrawal if held; watch for signs.
   - Continue citalopram.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO for now (?trach), TF recs.
   # Prophylaxis: heparin allergic; boots.
   # Access: peripherals, will likely need PICC.
   # Communication: Patient
   # Code:  Full
   # Disposition: ICU pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), tracheal stenosis, and anxiety.
- She is currently intubated due to recurrent acute pulmonary edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
- The patient has undergone multiple reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema.
- The etiology of acute pulmonary edema is not entirely clear, with possible causes including negative pressure edema, acute ischemic heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, or increased afterload.
- The patient also has a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but it does not seem to be related to her current symptoms.
- Other comorbidities include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI), systolic CHF, and pacer pocket pain/swelling.
- The patient is allergic to heparin agents and lisinopril (which can cause angioedema).
- She is currently on mechanical ventilation and may require a more definitive airway management to prevent further tracheal injury and bypass stenosed areas.
- The patient's recent chest X-ray showed fluid overload and bilateral pleural effusion.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema. The etiology of acute pulmonary edema is unclear, with possible causes including negative pressure edema, acute ischemic heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, or other factors.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including COPD and tracheal stenosis, which may be contributing to her dyspnea and respiratory failure. She also has a history of pacer pocket pain/swelling, urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by lactose fermenting Gram-negative rods, systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, she has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is currently mostly paced on telemonitoring.

The patient's current vital signs show a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 102/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 91%, and a temperature of 37.4°C.

   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - currently on PS 8 PEEP 5 FiO2 60% -> will wean PS and FiO2 then to
   trach collar
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - Lasix PRN
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket shows no abscess
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx
   - check with OSH re: culture
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain OSH TTE
   - continue BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - continue Lasix 40 IV
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - continue Statin.
   - restart ASA  (was held for trach placement)
   - Obtain OSH cath, echo, stress reports as above
   .
   # Afib. Currently mostly A paced on tele. Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on anticoagulation for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as above
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of chronic respiratory failure, coronary artery disease (CAD), systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), tracheal stenosis, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient has had multiple recent reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of chronic respiratory failure and recurrent acute pulmonary edema increases the risk of respiratory failure. Tracheal stenosis and COPD may contribute to her dyspnea and respiratory distress.

2. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is likely due to dehydration. This condition can lead to various symptoms such as confusion, seizures, and kidney dysfunction.

3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of CAD and systolic CHF. There is a discussion about the etiology of acute pulmonary edema, including the possibility of ischemic heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction. This indicates a risk for worsening cardiac function.

4. Pacer pocket pain/swelling: The patient has tenderness in the pacer pocket without erythema. This could be a sign of infection or inflammation around the pacemaker.

5. UTI: The patient has a lactose-fermenting gram-negative rod (GNR) UTI. If left"

   stenosed area if NPPE playing a role.  Will discuss today with
   ENT/[**Doctor Last Name 4311**] and IP/[**Doctor Last Name 4950**].  Will keep NPO in case able to do tomorrow.
   - Try to obtain further information re: enzyme or ECG changes with
   acute episodes; also obtain recent cath if any (from St Vincents) and
   recent stress (from PCP) and recent TTE (from [**Hospital1 4942**]).
   - CXR now to eval tube placement.
   - ECG and check cardiac enzymes.  Check BNP.
   - Consider Aline if prolonged intubation or attempting to manage
   without trach.
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - CXR.
   - Check BNP.
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket to eval for abscess
   - Hold on specific abx treatment for now.
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - Ceftriaxone for now.  Resend UA and culture.  Consider broadening as
   has been in hospital a lot recently.
   - Check with OSH tomorrow re: culture update.
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain TTE results if really was performed today at OSH.
   - BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - Lasix 40 IV BID for now, goal 1L neg in next 24 hours.  Mildly volume
   up.
   - Check BNP and CXR.
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - Statin.
   - ASA for now ? need to hold for trach.
   - Obtain cath, echo, stress reports as above.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old female with a history of COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis. She presented with recurrent acute pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. The etiology of acute pulmonary edema is unclear, with possible causes including negative pressure edema, acute ischemic heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, increased afterload, or a combination of factors. The patient has been intubated multiple times for acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications, including chronic respiratory failure, acute pain, anxiety, tracheal stenosis, UTI, systolic CHF, CAD, and pacer pocket pain/swelling. The UTI is caused by lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH, and the patient is currently receiving ceftriaxone. There is also a concern for possible abscess in the pacer pocket, which needs further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. The patient is alert and follows commands, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals bilateral"

 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   # Hypernatremia: likely [**2-23**] dehydration, now resolved after successful
   PO intake.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - successfully weaned to trach collar, on 50% FM currently
   - encourage pt to suction upper airway secretions by herself
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.

   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).

   FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the tracheostomy tube
   has
   been placed and the ET tube and the nasogastric tube have been removed.
   The
   tip of the endotracheal tube projects 4.8 cm above the carina.
   Unchanged position and course of the pacemaker leads. The ventilation
   of the
   lung has improved. The costophrenic sinuses are substantially better
   visible
   than on the previous examination. Unchanged size of the cardiac
   silhouette,
   regression of the bilateral supradiaphragmatic areas of atelectasis. No
   evidence of newly occurred focal parenchymal opacities.
   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, CHRONIC
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 ANXIETY
   68F with COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis s/p complicated
   respiratory failure history, presenting with recurrent acute pulmonary
   edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure.
   # Hypernatremia: likely [**2-23**] dehydration, now resolved after successful
   PO intake.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Has a complicated tracheal history as above
   with past trach now decannulated; now presenting with multiple recent
   reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported
   pulmonary edema.  Etiology of acute pulmonary edema not entirely clear
   - discussion of ?negative pressure edema from negative pressure
   generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic
   heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other cause of acute
   afterload increase (particularly likely as seems to have clear relation
   to anxiety), less likely total body volume overload given acuity of
   symptom onset.  Does not seem to be OSA related though that is in her
   history (no nighttime occurrences).  Also may be combination of factors
   - anxiety leading to increased afterload and poor forward flow leading
   to dyspnea, then severe dyspnea leading to increased intrathoracic
   pressures and worse dynamic airway stenosis. Now s/p trach placement.
   - successfully weaned to trach collar, on 50% FM currently
   .
   # Acute pulmonary edema.  Etiology unclear as above.  Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - Management of respiratory failure as above.
   - has maintained even I/Os, will use Lasix PRN
   - Continue CAD and CHF meds.  Need to clarify with patient and pharmacy
   if can be on lisinopril (listed on home meds, but also listed as
   allergy with angioedema - hold for now).
   .
   # COPD and tracheal stenosis.  Recent PFTs as per PMH.  Bronch during
   last admission revealing mild tracheal stenosis.  Unclear if this is
   contributing to her dyspnea and/or respiratory failure (primarily via
   negative pressure pulmonary edema and/or dynamic collapse of airways).
   - Trach as above.
   - ?home medication regimen for COPD - no inhalers currently listed.
   Can do inhalers prn while intubated.
   .
   # Pacer pocket pain/swelling.  Now about 2 weeks out from placement.
   Tender on exam though no erythema.
   - Ultrasound chest pocket shows no abscess
   .
   # UTI.  Lactose fermenting GNRs at OSH.
   - continue Ceftriaxone
   - f/u urine cx speciation/sensitivities
   .
   # Systolic CHF.
   - Obtain OSH TTE
   - continue BB.  Hold ACE given ? allergy as above.
   - continue Lasix 40 IV
   .
   # CAD.  Consideration of ischemia as cause of symptoms as above.
   - continue Statin
   - continue ASA  (was held for trach placement)
   - Obtain OSH cath, echo, stress reports as above
   .
   # Afib. Currently mostly A paced on tele. Otherwise having sinus
   beats.  Has never been on anticoagulation for unclear reasons.
   - Metoprolol as above
   .
   # Depression/anxiety.  Significant player in her respiratory distress
   episodes; not well managed as an outpatient with frequent admissions as
   per HPI.  Takes Ativan at home per patient, denies clonazepam.
   - continue citalopram
   - Ativan prn for now
   - Risk for BZ withdrawal if held; watch for signs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with a medical history of COPD, CAD, systolic CHF, and tracheal stenosis. She was admitted with recurrent acute pulmonary edema of unclear etiology and respiratory failure. The patient has had multiple recent reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress and reported pulmonary edema. Her hypernatremia has resolved after successful oral intake. She was successfully weaned to tracheostomy collar and is currently on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FM). The etiology of acute pulmonary edema is still unclear, but possible causes include negative pressure edema from negative pressure generation with pulling against stenosed upper airway, acute ischemic heart disease leading to diastolic dysfunction, other causes of acute afterload increase, and less likely total body volume overload given the acuity of symptom onset.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a complicated tracheal history with past tracheostomy now decannulated, recent reintubations for acute onset respiratory distress, and reported pulmonary edema. She may be at risk for further episodes of respiratory failure.
2. UTI: The patient has an infection caused by lactose fermenting gram-negative rods (GNRs) at Outside Hospital (OSH). She is currently being treated with ceftriaxone, and follow-up urine culture is pending for speciation/sensitivities.
3. Systolic CHF"
