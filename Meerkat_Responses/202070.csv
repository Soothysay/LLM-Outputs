   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HAP
   - f/u on Bcx, MRSA screen, Ucx
   - transfer to cardiology floor when stable
   - f/u Cardiac enzymes
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130's. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **], her out-patient cardiologist, switched her to digoxin recently.
   - continue metoprolol, coumadin (subtherapeutic - given additional abx,
   will likely rise INR)
   - continue low dose of 0.125 mg digoxin Q twice a week (Tuesday and
   Saturday).
   - trend INR.

   # Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was
   elevated at 2.5 from baseline in upper 1s. Throught to be
   pre-renal; patient was total body overloaded but intravascularly
   dry, likely due to poor forward flow.  MM may contribute to this too.

   # Coronary artery disease: Troponin was mildly elevated on
   admission at 0.09 in setting of ARF, likely a component of demand
   ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). She presents with worsening shortness of breath and is on bipap. BNP was elevated. The patient has fluid overload, infiltrate, COPD exacerbation, and myocardial infarction-induced heart failure decompensation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's baseline creatinine level was elevated, and there may be pre-renal azotemia due to poor forward flow. Monitoring urine electrolytes, urine eosinophils, and trending creatinine is advised.
2. Coronary artery disease: Troponin levels were mildly elevated, indicating demand ischemia. The patient should continue on aspirin, beta-blocker, and atorvastatin.
3. Depressed mental status: Baseline mental status assessment is difficult, and further evaluation is needed. ARF/COPD exacerbation could be contributing factors.
4. Multiple myeloma: The patient requires ongoing monitoring of creatinine and electrolyte levels.
5. Anemia: Anemia may be due to multiple myeloma. Stability at baseline is noted.
6. Seizure disorder: Dil"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (afib), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath and is experiencing bronchospasm. 

Initial assessment reveals that the patient may have fluid overload, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, or myocardial infarction-induced heart failure decompensation. The patient is on bipap, and BNP levels are elevated, indicating potential heart failure. 

Treatment plan includes continuing nasal canula, gentle diuresis for negative fluid balance, lasix bolus, nebs, vancomycin, and cefepime for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 24-48 hours until cultures are positive or other indication. The patient will also be transferred to the cardiology floor when stable and follow-up cardiac enzymes will be done.

The patient has atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the 130s. The patient's outpatient cardiologist recently switched her to digoxin. The treatment plan for afib includes continuing metoprolol, coumadin (subtherapeutic), and low-dose digoxin"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents today with worsening shortness of breath.
   # Shortness of Breath
Admssion physical was notable for bronchospasm.
   Chest X-ray on admission was suggestive of fluid overload vs infiltrate
   vs COPD exacerbation vs MI induced HF decompensation. She is on bipap.
   BNP was elevated ([**Numeric Identifier 12058**]); though not terribly fluid overloaded on exam
   If PNA, then possibly
aspiration
   - continue nasal canula
   - gentle diuresis for goal 500-1L negative daily
   - lasix bolus, nebs. (home dose is 40 mg PO), dampening response to
   lasix
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HAP x 24-48 hours until
   cx positive or other indication
   - f/u on Bcx, MRSA screen, Ucx
   - transfer to cardiology floor when stable
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130's. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **], her out-patient cardiologist, switched her to digoxin recently.
   - continue metoprolol, coumadin (subtherapeutic - given additional abx,
   will likely rise INR)
   - continue low dose of 0.125 mg digoxin Q twice a week (Tuesday and
   Saturday).
   - trend INR, no indication to bridge with heparin gtt to therapeutic
   INR
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated
   at 2.5 from baseline in upper 1s. Throught to be
   pre-renal; patient was total body overloaded but intravascularly  dry,
   likely due to poor forward flow.  MM may contribute to this too.
   - renal dose meds
   - trend cr
   - consider urine lytes and urine eos if trending up
   .
   # Depressed mental status: baseline mental status is hard to assess,
   will retry in AM. likely [**12-24**] ARF/COPD exacerbation.
   - follow MS
   - may have to convert meds to IV if not confident in swallow status
   - clarify with [**Hospital3 **] re: how often she misses meds, meals
   # Coronary artery disease: Troponin was mildly elevated on
   admission at 0.09 in setting of ARF, likely a component of demand
   ischemia.
   - continue on aspirin, beta-blocker, atorvastatin
   .
   # Multiple myeloma--required no management.
   - trend creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia: Perhaps due to multiple myeloma. Remained stable at
   baseline.
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted.  dilantin level checked
   and found to be within normal limits.
   - continued on dilantin at a dose of 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment.
   - on steroid currently

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath and an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating potential heart failure decompensation.

The patient's physical examination reveals wheezing, rales, and rhonchi on expiration, suggesting possible respiratory distress. The patient is currently on bipap for respiratory support. The chest X-ray on admission was inconclusive, showing fluid overload versus infiltrate versus COPD exacerbation versus myocardial infarction-induced heart failure decompensation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 117 bpm with atrial flutter, blood pressure ranging from 108/79 mmHg to 91/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 311 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.4 g/dL, sodium (Na+) of 140 mg/dL, potassium (K+) of 2.0 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) of 26 mEq/L,"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS
now has improved. Suspect this was
   multifactorial, mainly related to CHF given very elevated BNP, afib, MR
   in setting of  inability to take PO meds [**12-24**] MS. Also may be component
   of COPD probable multifactorial, including COPD exacerbation.  Plan
   treat COPD exacerbation, CHF and infection.  Monitor serial ECG and
   cardiac enzymes.  Plan monitor RR, SaO2, ABG, repeat CXR.  Low
   threshold for intubation.
   Treat COPD, wean O2, gentle diuresis, recheck BNP.  I am not that
   impressed that she is very volume overloaded at this time, though her
   intiial presentation and pulm exam was quite consistent with pulm edema
   FEVER
 unclear source, ? aspiration.  , p[resumed pna.  Will continue
   antbx empirically for now and follow up cx data.  [**Month (only) 60**] reflect
   early/evolving sepsis, unclear etiology.  Concerns include respiratory
   tract infection such as bronchitis, evolving pneumonia (no obvious
   infiltates on CXR), UTI (recurrent).  Blood cultures, urine culture.
   Maintain empirical Vanco, Cefopime.  Monitor VS.  Await culture
   results.
   ELEVATED BNP -- acute elevation, close to baseline, on background of
   chronic elevation (renal failure, chronic CHF).  Monitor BNP.
   A-FIB -- Poor rate control currently, likely related to infection, CHF,
   COPD exacerbation and inability to take PO meds ins etting of poor MS.
   Change to IV BB, dig, follow level.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- poor baseline.  [**Month (only) 60**] be contribution of
   underlying seizure disorder (post-ictal;). Although no clinical
   evidence for seizures.  Monitor mental status.  Able to protect airway
   at this time.
   ANEMIA
 chronic, value near baseline.
   CAD

   HYPERGLYCEMIA -- underlying diabetes mellitus, likely exacerbated by
   infection and high dose steroids. SSI,  Monitor glucose, maintain <150.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 84-year-old female with multiple medical problems including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, and anemia. She presented with shortness of breath (SOB) and altered mental status (AMS). 

The patient has been treated for presumed CHF, COPD exacerbation, and pneumonia. She is currently on several medications including digoxin, furosemide (Lasix), famotidine (Pepcid), and antbiotics (Vanco and cefepime). 

Her vital signs show a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/79 mmHg to 91/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and temperature of 36.9°C. 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, wheezes in the respiratory system, and irregular heart rhythm. Neurological examination shows somnolence and inability to follow commands. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, lactate acid level, and troponin T level. Imaging shows loss of left hemidiaphragm and full hilar vessels on chest X-ray. 

Assessment and plan include treating respiratory distress, suspected to be multifactorial, with focus on CHF and COPD exacerbation"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents today with worsening shortness of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of Breath
Admssion physical was notable for bronchospasm.
   Chest X-ray on admission was suggestive of fluid overload vs infiltrate
   vs COPD exacerbation vs HF decompensation. BNP was elevated ([**Numeric Identifier 12058**]);
   though not terribly fluid overloaded on exam. Patient  tolerates PO
   well. On Abx, steroids, diuresis and nebs has progressed from bipap to
   nasal cannula
   - continue nasal canula
   - gentle diuresis for goal 500-1L negative daily
   - lasix bolus, nebs. (home dose is 40 mg PO), dampening response to
   lasix  --> may have to increase home dose
   - continue vancomycin and cefepime for presumed HAP x 24-48 hours until
   cx positive or other indication
   - f/u on Bcx, MRSA screen, Ucx
   - transfer to cardiology floor when stable
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130's. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **], her out-patient cardiologist, switched her to digoxin recently.
   - continue metoprolol, coumadin (subtherapeutic - given additional abx,
   will likely rise INR)
   - continue low dose of 0.125 mg digoxin Q twice a week (Tuesday and
   Saturday).
   - trend INR, no indication to bridge with heparin gtt to therapeutic
   INR
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated
   at 2.5 from baseline in upper 1s. Throught to be pre-renal; patient was
   total body overloaded but intravascularly  dry, likely due to poor
   forward flow.  MM may contribute to this too.
   - renal dose meds
   - trend cr
   - consider urine lytes and urine eos if trending up
   .
   # Depressed mental status: baseline mental status is hard to assess,
   will retry in AM. likely [**12-24**] ARF/COPD exacerbation.
   - follow MS
   - may have to convert meds to IV if not confident in swallow status
   - clarify with [**Hospital3 **] re: how often she misses meds, meals
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: Troponin was mildly elevated on admission at
   0.09 in setting of ARF, likely a component of demand ischemia.
   - continue on aspirin, beta-blocker, atorvastatin
   .
   # Multiple myeloma--required no management.
   - trend creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia: Perhaps due to multiple myeloma. Remained stable at baseline.
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted.  dilantin level checked
   and found to be within normal limits.
   - continued on dilantin at a dose of 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment.
   - on steroid currently

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

- The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
- The patient presents with worsening shortness of breath and was initially on BiPAP but has progressed to nasal cannula oxygen delivery.
- The chest X-ray showed fluid overload versus infiltrate versus COPD exacerbation versus heart failure decompensation.
- The patient is already receiving antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, and nebulizers.
- The goal is to achieve a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL per day.
- There is a discussion about adjusting the home dose of Lasix due to dampening response.
- Vancomycin and cefepime are being continued for presumed hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) for 24-48 hours until culture results are available.
- Blood cultures have been sent, and the patient will be transferred to the cardiology floor when stable.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation, and her heart rate is elevated. She is on digoxin and metoprolol.
- The patient has acute on chronic renal failure,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, multiple myeloma, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. She presents with worsening shortness of breath and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient is currently on various medications including PPI, famotidine, furosemide, metoprolol, and others. She has been diagnosed with erosive esophagitis, esophageal candidiasis, and has shown improvement in her renal function. The patient's mental status is depressed, and she requires further evaluation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's COPD and worsening shortness of breath, there is a potential for respiratory complications such as pneumonia or exacerbation of COPD.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient has a history of CAD, CHF, and atrial fibrillation, which puts her at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia.
3. Renal Complications: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, and close monitoring of her renal function is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
4. Gastrointestinal Complications: The patient has erosive esophagitis, and there is a risk for gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcers.
5. Infection: The patient is at risk for"

   Assessment and Plan
   84 y/o F with hx of DM, CAD, CHF, COPD, afib, MM, HTN and CKD who
   presents today with worsening shortness of breath.
   .
   # Shortness of Breath
Admission physical was notable for bronchospasm.
   Chest X-ray on admission was suggestive of fluid overload vs infiltrate
   vs COPD exacerbation vs HF decompensation. BNP was elevated ([**Numeric Identifier 12058**]);
   though not terribly fluid overloaded on exam. Patient  tolerates PO
   well. On Abx, steroids, diuresis and nebs has progressed from bipap to
   nasal cannula
   - continue nasal cannula
   - gentle diuresis for goal 500-1L negative daily
   - lasix bolus, nebs. (home dose is 40 mg PO), dampening response to
   lasix
   - stop vancomycin and cefepime as low suspicion for HAP
   - f/u on Bcx, MRSA screen, Ucx
   - transfer to cardiology floor when stable
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: Heart rate noted to be elevated to 130's. Dr.
   [**Last Name (STitle) **], her outpatient cardiologist, switched her to digoxin recently.
   - continue metoprolol, coumadin.  Although uptitration of metoprolol
   could lead to better rate control, not clear if this impacts her
   symptoms; additionally, may worsen bronchospasm.
   - continue low dose of 0.125 mg digoxin Q twice a week (Tuesday and
   Saturday).
   .
   # Acute on chronic renal failure: On admission, creatinine was elevated
   at 2.5 from baseline in upper 1s. Throught to be pre-renal; patient was
   total body overloaded but intravascularly dry, likely due to poor
   forward flow.  MM may contribute to this too.  Now improved to
   baseline.
   - renal dose meds
   - trend Cr
   .
   # depressed mental status: baseline mental status is hard to assess,
   will retry in AM. likely [**12-24**] ARF/COPD exacerbation.
   - follow MS
   - may have to convert meds to IV if not confident in swallow status
   - clarify with [**Hospital3 **] re: how often she misses meds, meals
   .
   # Coronary artery disease: Troponin was mildly elevated on admission at
   0.09 in setting of ARF, likely a component of demand ischemia.
   - continue on aspirin, beta-blocker, atorvastatin
   .
   # Multiple myeloma--required no management.
   - trend creatinine and electrolytes
   .
   # Anemia: Perhaps due to multiple myeloma. Remained stable at baseline.
   .
   # Seizure Disorder: no seizure activity noted.  dilantin level checked
   and found to be within normal limits.
   - continued on dilantin at a dose of 250 mg [**Hospital1 **].
   .
   # COPD/chronic bronchitis: remained on home nebulizer treatment.
   - d/c steroids, as we feel that overriding cause of SOB was CHF, not
   COPD

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 84-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (AF), multiple myeloma (MM), hypertension (HTN), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient presented with worsening shortness of breath and was found to have bronchospasm on admission. A chest X-ray showed signs of fluid overload, but the patient did not appear to be severely fluid overloaded during the physical examination. The patient has been on antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, and nebulizers and has progressed from BiPAP to nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

Plan:
- Continue nasal cannula oxygen
- Goal of gentle diuresis to achieve 500-1000 mL negative daily fluid balance
- Administer Lasix bolus, nebs, and dampen response to Lasix
- Stop vancomycin and cefepime as low suspicion for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
- Follow up on blood cultures, MRSA screen, and urinalysis
- Transfer to cardiology floor when stable

Other issues addressed in the note include atrial fibrillation, acute-on-chronic renal failure, depressed mental status, coronary artery disease, multiple myeloma, anemia, seizure disorder, and COPD/chronic bronchitis. These conditions are"

","The patient is a 72-year-old female with a chief complaint of acute shortness of breath (SOB). She has a history of multiple myeloma, chronic anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), seizure, acute renal failure, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient's current condition is presumed to be worsening congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/77 mmHg to 84/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and an ECG showing atrial fibrillation. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, no overweight or obesity, poor dentition, normal head and neck examination, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination.

Laboratory results show hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 267 K/uL, sodium level of 141 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.5 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.8 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 140 mg/dL, and a troponin-T level of 0.05. Other lab values are within normal range.
