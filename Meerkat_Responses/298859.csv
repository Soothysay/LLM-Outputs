   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure:
   Likely tachypnea secondary to metabolic acidosis; pt was tiring out
   trying to compensate by respiratory means
   Has been having recently worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable
   orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation in the ED. Repeat
   CXR shows increased bilateral opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
   Heart failure is possible with her BNP elevation and history of
   orthopnea, although she has no known heart failure. Influenza another
   possibility, though less likely, given concurrent fever and dry cough.
   CXR was not concerning for pneumonia or fluid overload.  Consider also
   ischemia given report of chest pain, although EKG reportedly negative
   and cardiac markers negative x2, so not likely ACS. ABG shows good
   oxygenation and patient has been switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.
   PE less likely
   - Cont PSV for now and wean as tolerated
   - R/o influenza
   - f/u w TTE from this morning
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Bandemia and lactate improving, still febrile and requiring pressors.
   Sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation with
   sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known choledocholithiasis. No
   other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with vancomycin and pip-tazo
   - ERCP today for biliary drainage
   - Trend CBC/diff, lactate, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   - Check ScvO2
   .
    # Anion gap acidosis:
   Most likely lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis.  Also has a non-gap
   acidosis, likely from chronic diarrhea.  Gap acidosis improving with
   IVF.
   - Cont IVF per sepsis protocol
   - trend lactate
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - IVFs for CVP 10-12
   - f/u Urine lytes
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend renal function
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Likely secondary to sepsis.
   - send DIC labs

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 85F a w/ renal ca, dementia,
   choledocolithiasis presents with n/v X 2 days, diarrhea, dyspnea, Fever
   100.9.  In ED CXR clear initially but intubated for ? evolving
   infiltrates and resp distress. RIJ CVL placed for hypotension with IVF
   given, levophed then started. Received vanco/zosyn  Labs concerning for
   biliary sepsis with t bili 9.9, transaminitis, AGMA, lactate 4.5, 18%
   bandemia and cr 2.6.  RUQ with dil cbd, sludge with ERCP consulted and
   plan for ERCP in am today.

   ECG with NSR TWI 3, v1. no ST changes
   Imaging reviewed: cxr appears rotated, pulm vascular fullness, no focal
   infiltrate though would watch r mid zone for possible evolving asp pna
   A/P: Sepsis appears from biliary source/cholangitis, c/b arf and resp
   failure.  Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary lung process, as CXR
   is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of met acidosis she
   fatigued. There is a component of mild demand ischemia by trop without
   frank ecg changes.  Agree with plan to manage biliary sepsis with broad
   antibx (vanco, zosyn for now f/u cx data), plan for ercp today to
   relieve obstruction.  She does not appear fully tanked from volume
   standpoint.  Will continue aggressive IVF (LR given NG as well as AGMA)
   for cvp > 10, weaning pressor off, following u/o, trending lactate,
   lfts, a/l.  Will continue current vent support as she is oxygenating
   well and appears comfortable on PS. Follow abgs closely for signs of
   fatigue noting her continued met acidosis. Evidence of mild demand
   ischemia in setting of septic picture--trop are  flat and without
   progressive ecg changes.  Volume may be an issue in setting of
   extubation.  TTE will be helpful. . Her ARF likely [**3-13**] vol repletion
   from sepsis, n/v and diarrhea.  Aggressive fluids as above, send urine
   lytes. Thrombocytopenia likely in part dilutional and related to
   sepsis, also concerning for DIC. Send dic panel. Low suspicion for
   HIT.  ICU prophy. Consider a-line placement if unable to wean off
   pressor. Remainder of plan as outlined in resident note. Need to
   confirm code status w/ family.
   Patient is critically ill
   Total time: 55 min.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presents with dyspnea, vomiting, acute respiratory failure, and septic shock. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may progress if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.

2. Sepsis: Given the patient's history of choledocholithiasis, the presence of biliary sludge, and elevated inflammatory markers, there is a risk of ongoing sepsis. Prompt management of biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy is essential.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by an elevated baseline creatinine level. Aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring of renal function are necessary.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, which may be related to sepsis or dilutional effects from fluid administration. Further evaluation and management are required, including consideration for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

5. Ischemia: Although the EKG is negative, there is evidence of mild demand ischemia, which should be monitored closely.

6. Pulmonary Edema: The presence of bilateral opacities"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressure support mode. She is also receiving sedation and analgesia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has tachypnea secondary to metabolic acidosis. Her recent worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable orthopnea, and acute shortness of breath requiring intubation suggest possible heart failure or pulmonary edema. Influenza is another possibility, although less likely. Ischemia could be considered given the report of chest pain, but cardiac markers have been negative twice, making acute coronary syndrome unlikely.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has bandemia and improving lactate levels, indicating a possible sepsis secondary to a biliary source, considering the CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive liver function tests in the setting of known choledocholithiasis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and an ERCP is planned for biliary drainage.

   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure:
   Likely tachypnea secondary to metabolic acidosis; pt was tiring out
   trying to compensate by respiratory means
   Has been having recently worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable
   orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation in the ED. Repeat
   CXR shows increased bilateral opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.
   Heart failure is possible with her BNP elevation and history of
   orthopnea, although she has no known heart failure. Influenza another
   possibility given concurrent fever and dry cough. Pneumonia less likely
   as initial CXR was clear and there was no sputum. Has smoking history,
   but no wheezing or CO2 retention to suggest COPD. Would also consider
   ischemia given report of chest pain, although EKG reportedly negative
   and cardiac markers negative x1. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient
   has been switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.
   - Cont PSV for now and wean as tolerated
   - R/o influenza
   - TTE in am to eval for heart failure
   - Repeat CXR in am
   - Cycle cardiac markers
   .
   # Septic shock:
   Bandemia and lactate improving, still febrile and requiring pressors.
   Sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation with
   sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known choledocholithiasis. No
   other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with vancomycin and pip-tazo
   - ERCP today for biliary drainage
   - Trend CBC/diff, lactate, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   - Check ScvO2
   .
    # Anion gap acidosis:
   Most likely lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis.  Also has a non-gap
   acidosis, likely from chronic diarrhea.  Gap acidosis improving with
   IVF.
   - Cont IVF per sepsis protocol
   - trend lactate
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. Baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - IVFs for CVP 10-12
   - f/u Urine lytes
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend renal function
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia
   Likely secondary to sepsis.
   - send DIC labs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which led to acute respiratory failure and septic shock. The patient is currently in the ICU and receiving various treatments and monitoring.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned in the note are:

1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening dyspnea on exertion and stable orthopnea may indicate heart failure or pulmonary edema. There is also a possibility of pneumonia, influenza, or ischemia. Continuous monitoring of respiratory function and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.

2. Septic Shock: The patient has bandemia and improving lactate levels, indicating a response to treatment. However, she is still febrile and requires pressors. Sepsis appears to be secondary to a biliary source due to choledocholithiasis. ERCP for biliary drainage will be performed, and close monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and liver function tests is needed.

3. Anion Gap Acidosis: The patient has lactic acidosis secondary to sepsis, which is improving with IV fluids. There is also non-gap acidosis likely due to chronic diarrhea. Continued IVF administration and monitoring of lactate levels will be required.

","Summary:
The patient is a 83.8 kg male with a chief complaint of multi lumen start on [**2169-11-22**] 03:45 AM. The patient has no known drug allergies and received a dose of Vancomycin at [**2169-11-22**] 06:30 AM. The patient is currently receiving infusions of Norepinephrine, Midazolam (Versed), and Fentanyl. Other ICU medications and changes to medical and family history are mentioned but not detailed in the note.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 79-97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 86/49-94/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm and weighs 83.8 kg.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure of 6 mmHg, with total fluid intake of 369 mL and output including 150 mL of urine, 0 mL of blood products, and 219 mL of drain balance. Respiratory support is provided through an endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation mode, set at a tidal volume of 451-470 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 79, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 17 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.31, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 37 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 332 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 20 mEq/L. The patient's ventilation rate is 9.3 L/min, and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 332.

Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic aspects. Radiology images are included but not described in the note.

Assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines (multi lumen and 20 gauge), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status and disposition are mentioned but not detailed.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:
1. Infection: The patient's elevated temperature and the presence of radiology images suggest the possibility of an infection. Further investigation is needed to confirm this.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which may require adjustment of vasopressor infusion"

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of
   met acidosis she fatigued. Has been having recently worsening dyspnea
   on exertion, stable orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation
   in the ED. Heart failure is less likely as echo and CXR do not show any
   evidence of this. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient has been
   switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.
   - Cont PSV for now and wean as tolerated; consider sbt once patient can
   tolerate no sedation and no pressors
   - goal to extubate patient today
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP yesterday showed significant pus and s/p stent
   placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down. Lactate now
   normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD
   dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with vancomycin and pip-tazo until
   sensitivies return
   - Trend CBC/diff, lactate, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx;  GPR may be contamination, but will
   continue to cover broadly for now until further speciation.
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   - Check ScvO2
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia who presented with dyspnea and vomiting. She was found to have acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure, which showed pus extruding from the major papilla and a choledochoduodenal fistula. A biliary stent was successfully placed. The patient's condition has improved, with stable vital signs and decreasing white blood cell count. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to sepsis secondary to a biliary source. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary to ensure adequate gas exchange.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to the presence of pus and a choledochoduodenal fistula. Continuous monitoring of vital signs, blood cultures, and lactate levels is essential to detect any signs of infection or worsening sepsis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function may be compromised due to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion. Maintaining adequate fluid balance and avoiding nephrotoxic agents are important to prevent further kidney injury.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia,"

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of
   met acidosis she fatigued. Has been having recently worsening dyspnea
   on exertion, stable orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation
   in the ED. Heart failure is less likely as echo and CXR do not show any
   evidence of this. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient has been
   switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.  Some hemodynamic instability
   during SBT, with afib on AC for now.
   - Attempt to change back to PSV for now and wean as tolerated; consider
   sbt once patient can tolerate no sedation
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - goal to extubate patient today
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Appears to be first episode as no history of
   this in past. Likely exacerbated by SBT and being on levophed in the
   setting of infection. Hemodynamically stable for now with rates in the
   110
   - EKG
   -  If fast rate persists or if worsening hemodynamics, consider
   changing levophed to phenylephrine as to reduce beta agonist activity
   and worsen afib with RVR.
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP yesterday showed significant pus and s/p stent
   placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down. Lactate now
   normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD
   dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with pip-tazo until sensitivies return; d/c
   vanc as GI infection not likely MRSA.
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx;  GPR may be contamination, but will
   continue to cover broadly for now until further speciation.
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. Currently stable at 2.1;  Baseline
   creatinine 1.2-1.4. - urine lytes: Fena: 0.2...pre-renal; in case she
   had lasix, FeUrea: 14.9%...pre-renal likely. Since fluids do not seem
   to correct very fast, likely a component of ATN as well.
   - IVFs for CVP 10-12
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend renal function with PM chem. 10.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. DIC and repeat labs
   equivical; low suscipicion of HIT as timing does not correlate.
   Concerning as platelets continuing to decrease. Vancomycin/ may be a
   possibility as known to cause thrombocytopenia.
   - D/C vanc and heparin today
   - unlikely DIC at this point
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Re-check cbc at 1500
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Cont IVF per sepsis protocol; will give bicarb as needed for bicarb
   less than 18 or LR if needs resuscitation to prevent further  NG
   acidosis.

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU

   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 85F a w/ renal ca, dementia,
   choledocolithiasis in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] w/ sepsis/shock from cholangitis s/p ERCP
   with stent placement yesterday.  Required intermittent neo boluses
   peri-proceudre.  Remains on levophed though titrating down. During SBT

   A/P: Sepsis from cholangitis c/b arf, resp failure and
   thrombocytopenia.  Now with new a-fib.
   While a-fib temporally related to SBT, suspect component of increased
   myocardial excitability [**3-13**] pressors as well as underlying sepsis
   contributing.  She has no underlying lung process as cause of her
   intubation, which seemed mainly related to inability to compensate for
   metabolic acidosis. She has had lots of fluids, though and  increased
   WOB during SBT could have contributed.  Her TTE yesterday showed good
   bivent fx.
   Agree with plan to repeat CXR and abg, transition back to PSV. Her HR
   is not rapid and BP has not changed. Will check 12 lead and assess for
   ischemia. Continue IVF boluses for cvp and u/o and wean pressor,
   maintaining MAPS > 65. If develops RVR, consider changing pressor to
   neo and adding rate control. Monitor resp and hemodynamic status
   closely and consider repeat SBT later in afternoon.  We continue to
   treat biliary sepsis with anitbx.  Continue zosyn and can d/c vanco,
   following cx data.  Infection parameters are improving with decreasing
   wbc and temp curve. Her cr is down slightly from admit but not at
   baseline.  ARF is likely pre-renal + atn from sepsis/hypotension.  U/o
   holding with boluses. She continues to have worsening thrombocytopenia.
   No recent heparin exposure to suggest HIT occurring so quiclky.
   Suspect this is infection response or [**3-13**] medications. Will hold
   heparin products and monitor, following DIC labs, and keeping t and c.

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of
   met acidosis she fatigued. Has been having recently worsening dyspnea
   on exertion, stable orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation
   in the ED. Heart failure is less likely as echo and CXR do not show any
   evidence of this. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient has been
   switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.  Some hemodynamic instability
   during SBT, with afib on AC for now.
   - Attempt to change back to PSV for now and wean as tolerated; consider
   sbt once patient can tolerate no sedation
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - goal to extubate patient today
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Appears to be first episode as no history of
   this in past. Likely exacerbated by SBT and being on levophed in the
   setting of infection. Hemodynamically stable for now with rates in the
   110
   - EKG
   -  If fast rate persists or if worsening hemodynamics, consider
   changing levophed to phenylephrine as to reduce beta agonist activity
   and worsen afib with RVR.
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP yesterday showed significant pus and s/p stent
   placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down. Lactate now
   normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD
   dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with pip-tazo until sensitivies return; d/c
   vanc as GI infection not likely MRSA.
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx;  GPR may be contamination, but will
   continue to cover broadly for now until further speciation.
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. Currently stable at 2.1;  Baseline
   creatinine 1.2-1.4. - urine lytes: Fena: 0.2...pre-renal; in case she
   had lasix, FeUrea: 14.9%...pre-renal likely. Since fluids do not seem
   to correct very fast, likely a component of ATN as well.
   - IVFs for CVP 10-12
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend renal function with PM chem. 10.
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. DIC and repeat labs
   equivical; low suscipicion of HIT as timing does not correlate.
   Concerning as platelets continuing to decrease. Vancomycin/ may be a
   possibility as known to cause thrombocytopenia.
   - D/C vanc and heparin today
   - unlikely DIC at this point
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Re-check cbc at 1500
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Cont IVF per sepsis protocol; will give bicarb as needed for bicarb

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal carcinoma, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. She underwent an ERCP procedure and stent placement. The patient's current condition includes dyspnea/respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, septic shock, and acute kidney injury.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure does not appear to be a primary lung process. However, she may experience worsening dyspnea on exertion, stable orthopnea, and acute SOB requiring intubation. Heart failure is less likely as the echo and chest X-ray do not show any evidence of this. The patient's ABG shows good oxygenation, and she has been switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with FiO2 40%. Some hemodynamic instability during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), with atrial fibrillation on assist control ventilation (AC) for now.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: This appears to be the patient's first episode, likely exacerbated by SBT and being on levophed in the setting of infection. Hemodynamically stable for now with rates in the 110s.
3. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which led to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely caused by a biliary source. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stent placement. Currently, she is in the intensive care unit (ICU) on mechanical ventilation and receiving various medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to primary lung processes or secondary to other causes such as heart failure or sepsis. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation, likely exacerbated by a stress test and being on levophed during infection. Hemodynamic stability is currently maintained, but further management is required.
3. Sepsis/Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock secondary to cholangitis and an infected stone/sludge. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient may have acute kidney injury related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion. Fluid resuscitation and careful monitoring of renal function are necessary.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopen"

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of
   met acidosis she fatigued. Has been having recently worsening dyspnea
   on exertion, stable orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation
   in the ED. Heart failure is less likely as echo and CXR do not show any
   evidence of this. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient has been
   switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.  Some hemodynamic instability
   during SBT, with afib on AC for now.
   - Attempt to change back to PSV for now and wean as tolerated; consider
   sbt once patient can tolerate no sedation
   - wean pressors as tolerated
   - goal to extubate patient today
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Appears to be first episode as no history of
   this in past. Likely exacerbated by SBT and being on levophed in the
   setting of infection. Hemodynamically stable for now with rates in the
   110
   - EKG
   -  If fast rate persists or if worsening hemodynamics, consider
   changing levophed to phenylephrine as to reduce beta agonist activity
   and worsen afib with RVR.
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP yesterday showed significant pus and s/p stent
   placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down. Lactate now
   normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD
   dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Cont broad spectrum abx with pip-tazo until sensitivies return; d/c
   vanc as GI infection not likely MRSA.
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx , urine cx;  GPR may be contamination, but will
   continue to cover broadly for now until further speciation.
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean norepinephrine as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea. Currently stable at 2.1;  Baseline
   creatinine 1.2-1.4. - urine lytes: Fena: 0.2...pre-renal; in case she
   had lasix, FeUrea: 14.9%...pre-renal likely. Since fluids do not seem

   - IVFs for CVP 10-12
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Trend renal function with PM chem. 10.

   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. DIC and repeat labs
   equivical; low suscipicion of HIT as timing does not correlate.
   Concerning as platelets continuing to decrease. Vancomycin/ may be a
   possibility as known to cause thrombocytopenia.

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient experienced worsening dyspnea on exertion and stable orthopnea before requiring intubation in the emergency department.
- An echocardiogram showed mild left atrial dilation, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic function (LVEF >65%), with a normal estimated cardiac index. Trace aortic regurgitation and mild mitral regurgitation were also observed.
- Blood cultures revealed an infection with anaerobic bacteria.
- The patient's respiratory status improved with non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and supplemental oxygen.
- The patient remains on minimal sedation and is being weaned off all sedatives and pressors.
- The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, and lactate levels have normalized.
- Renal function is stable, but there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion.

   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium

   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left

   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but suspect in setting of
   met acidosis she fatigued. Has been having recently worsening dyspnea
   on exertion, stable orthopnea. Became acutely SOB requiring intubation
   in the ED. Heart failure is less likely as echo and CXR do not show any
   evidence of this. ABG shows good oxygenation and patient has been
   switched to PSV 10/5 with FiO2 40%.
   - Cont PSV for now and wean as tolerated; consider sbt once patient can
   tolerate no sedation and no pressors

   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP yesterday showed significant pus and s/p stent
   placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down. Lactate now
   normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD
   dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal carcinoma, and dementia who presented with dyspnea and vomiting. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure and septic shock, likely secondary to a biliary source. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and stent placement.

Summary of Progress:
- The patient's condition has improved since the ERCP procedure, with a decrease in white blood cell count and normalization of lactate levels.
- She is currently on minimal sedation and is trying to wean off pressors.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 99/50 mmHg to 144/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%.
- The patient is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her urine output has improved with the administration of D5W with 3 amps bicarb.
- Her renal function is stable, with a creatinine level of 2.1.
- The patient's platelet count is decreasing, but there are no signs of active bleeding.
- The mixed anion gap (lactic acid)/non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea) acidosis has resolved.

Potential Medical Complications:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and stent placement. Currently, she is in the ICU with multiple medical complications.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation due to acute respiratory failure. She has been switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The goal is to wean the patient off sedation and extubate her today.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation (AF) during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is currently on atrioventricular (AV) sequential pacing mode. The rate is currently in the 110s, and the hemodynamics are stable. If the fast rate persists or worsens, the levophed may be changed to phenylephrine to reduce beta agonist activity and worsen AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED. Has
   been doing well on the ventilator, had hoped to extubate her yesterday,
   however she went into A.fib with RVR during her [**Last Name (LF) 1324**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
   intially changed back to A/C, then transitioned back to PSV.
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] early this morning, discontinue sedation for hopeful extubation
   this morning
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s, pressor changed
   from levophed to neo without any effect, her BP dropped with IV dilt,
   so started amiodarone morning of [**11-24**] due to continued pressor
   requirement
   - Monitor for improvement and hopeful d/c of amio once patient is
   extubated and off sedation
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - Cont IVF to keep CVP 10-12 mmHg and good UOP
   - Wean neo as tolerated by MAP >= 65 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also likely some component of ATN
   as her renal function has not improved as quickly with fluids as would
   be expected in a purely pre-renal picture. Cr improving to 1.6 today,
   baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4. - urine lytes: Fena: 0.2...pre-renal; in
   case she had lasix, FeUrea: 14.9%...
   - IVFs for CVP 10-12: patient bolused large volume of fluid yesterday
   with improvement in CVP to 12
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion of HIT as
   timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior heparin
   exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia.  Platelets slightly increased today.
   - Continue to hold vanc/heparin
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Bicarb 26 today, extubation will be facilitated by resolution of
   acidosis.

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia who presented with dyspnea and vomiting that complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. She underwent an ERCP procedure with stent placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has been doing well on the ventilator. She had hoped to be extubated yesterday, but experienced atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and was transitioned back to pressure support ventilation.
- Atrial Fibrillation: It first occurred during the patient's 1324 event on 11/23, initially with rates in the 110s, then increasing to the 130s. The patient's blood pressure dropped when IV diltiazem was given, so amiodarone was started in the morning due to continued pressor requirement.
- Septic shock: This is likely secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. The ERCP showed significant pus and a very large stone, and the patient underwent stent placement. The patient is afebrile, white count trending down, lactate now normal, and initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in the setting of known choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection was found.

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED. Has
   been doing well on the ventilator, had hoped to extubate her yesterday,
   however she went into A.fib with RVR during her [**Last Name (LF) 1324**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
   intially changed back to A/C, then transitioned back to PSV.
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] early this morning, discontinue sedation for hopeful extubation
   this morning
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s, pressor changed
   from levophed to neo without any effect, her BP dropped with IV dilt,
   so started amiodarone morning of [**11-24**] due to continued pressor
   requirement
   - Monitor for improvement and hopeful d/c of amio once patient is
   extubated and off sedation
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - With increasing leukocytosis concern for a new infection, will
   reculture blood, urine and sputum, also send a C.diff when patient has
   a bowel movement, if LFT
s increase, will reimage RUQ due to concern
   for possible blockage of stent
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs, especially in the setting on increasing
   leukocytosis, will add on Diff to AM labs
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - Wean neo as tolerated by MAP >= 60 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also likely some component of ATN
   as her renal function has not improved as quickly with fluids as would
   be expected in a purely pre-renal picture. Cr improving to 1.6 today,
   baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Titrate MAP to greater than 60, unless urine output decreases then
   will titrate to increased MAP
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion of HIT as
   timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior heparin
   exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia.  Platelets slightly increased today.
   - Continue to hold vanc/heparin
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   - If platelets remain stable or increase tomorrow would restart heparin
   as HIT is very unlikely
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Bicarb 26 today, extubation will be facilitated by resolution of
   acidosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which led to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. The patient underwent an ERCP and stent placement.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation due to acute respiratory failure. She has been doing well on the ventilator, but there have been difficulties weaning her off due to volume overload. Once off pressors, diuretics may be needed to decrease fluid in the lungs.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation during a trial of extubation, with heart rates in the 110s and 130s. Pressor changes were made without effect, and her blood pressure dropped with IV diltiazem. Amiodarone was started on the morning of [11-24] due to continued pressor requirement.

3. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pus and a very large stone. She underwent stent placement, and her condition has improved, with afebrile status and trending down white blood cell count. Lactate levels are now normal.

   ERCP: The major papilla was intra-diverticular. Pus was seen extruding
   from the major papilla. An opening draining bile and pus consistent
   with a choledochoduodenal fistula was seen at the superior portion of
   the major papilla. Cannulation of the biliary duct was successful and
   deep with a sphincterotome using a free-hand technique. Contrast medium
   was injected resulting in complete opacification.  A single 2.5-3cm
   filling defect consistent witha stone or sludge ball that was causing
   partial obstruction was seen at the mid CBD.  A 10FR by 5cm double
   pigtail biliary stent was placed successfully using a Oasis 10FR stent
   introducer kit.
   Echo: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal
   (LVEF >65%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
   seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is high normal.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-12-23**], the left
   ventricle is less dynamic, the velocity across the aortic valve is
   lower (now normal), and the severity of tricuspid regurgitation and
   pulmonary artery systolic pressure are lower.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to biliary source. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED. Has
   been doing well on the ventilator, had hoped to extubate her yesterday,
   however she went into A.fib with RVR during her [**Last Name (LF) 1324**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
   intially changed back to A/C, then transitioned back to PSV.
   - [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] early this morning
patient very tachypneic with lower tidal
   volumes, appeared very uncomfortable during short trial this morning,
   will transition back to A/C and then wean to PSV throughout the day
   -Chest x-ray appeared volume overloaded, which is likely contributing
   to the difficulty weaning her off the ventilator, when patient is able
   to be weaned off pressors will need diuresis.  Hopefully patient will
   start to mobilize her extra fluid, however once off pressors if she is
   unable to, will give lasix as needed to help decrease the fluid in her
   lungs
   - Hopeful extubation tomorrow pending ability to diurese
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**] on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s, pressor changed
   from levophed to neo without any effect, her BP dropped with IV dilt,
   so started amiodarone morning of [**11-24**] due to continued pressor
   requirement
   - Monitor for improvement and hopeful d/c of amio once patient is
   extubated and off sedation
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - With increasing leukocytosis concern for a new infection, will
   reculture blood, urine and sputum, also send a C.diff when patient has
   a bowel movement, if LFT
s increase, will reimage RUQ due to concern
   for possible blockage of stent
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; f/u speciation and
   sensitivities from prior blood cx
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs, especially in the setting on increasing
   leukocytosis, will add on Diff to AM labs
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - Wean neo as tolerated by MAP >= 60 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also likely some component of ATN
   as her renal function has not improved as quickly with fluids as would
   be expected in a purely pre-renal picture. Cr improving to 1.6 today,
   baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Titrate MAP to greater than 60, unless urine output decreases then
   will titrate to increased MAP
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion of HIT as
   timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior heparin
   exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia.  Platelets slightly increased today.
   - Continue to hold vanc/heparin
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   - If platelets remain stable or increase tomorrow would restart heparin
   as HIT is very unlikely
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Bicarb 26 today, extubation will be facilitated by resolution of
   acidosis.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Will place OG tube for tube feeds today and turn them off at
   midnight for hopeful extubation tomorrow

   MICU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I saw and examined the patient and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   resident note, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 85F a w/ renal ca, dementia,
   choledocolithiasis in [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] w/ sepsis/shock from cholangitis s/p ERCP
   with stent placement.  She remains intubated, Course has been c/b

   A/P: Sepsis from cholangitis c/b arf, resp failure, thrombocytopenia.,
   and a-fib. Her WBC is rising.  She failed [**Last Name (un) 1324**] this am, likely related
   to extra volume.  She remains on pressors.
   Agree with plan to rest on ACV and trial back on PS later today as she
   tolerates following abg and clinical picture. Her MAPs are adequate and
   we should be able to titrate off pressor support. She remains on amio
   gtt/load for rate control. Her cr continues to improve toward her
   baseline CRI and her urine outpt is excellent.  We hope she will
   continue to mobilize fluids, though once BP is stable off pressors, we
   may need diurese prior to [**Last Name (un) 1324**] and extubation. We continue to treat
   biliary sepsis with zosyn. Given her rising wbc ct, we are concerned
   for new infection.  Her lfts are down and her abd exam benign, there is
   no diarrhea or new secretions and she remains AF.  Her lines are just a
   few days old.  We will repeat pan cxs, check for c diff, and f/u
   pending cx speciation /sensitivities. We keep a low threshold for
   broadened coverage in setting of temp spike or clinical decline. We
   continue to monitor her plts closely and suspect her thrombocytopenia
   is [**3-13**] infection response or [**3-13**] medications noting no recent heparin
   exposure to support early HIT. Will continue to hold heparin products
   and monitor, following DIC labs, and keeping t and c. A-line and CVL.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting and developed acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to a biliary source. The patient underwent an ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and has been doing well on the ventilator. However, she had an unsuccessful extubation attempt yesterday due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She will be transitioned back to assist-control ventilation and then weaned to pressure support ventilation throughout the day.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced her first episode of atrial fibrillation during the morning of [**First Name3 (LF) 1324**]. Her heart rate was initially in the 110s, then increased to the 130s. Despite changing pressors from levophed to neo, there was no effect, and her blood pressure dropped with IV diltiazem. Therefore, amiodarone was started in the morning of [**11-24**].

3. Septic shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pus and a large stone, and the patient has undergone stent placement. She is afebrile, and her white"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED.
   Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to fluid resuscitation; as
   fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Monitor UOP as patient is auto-diuresing well. Check i/o
s this
   evening with TBB 1-1.5 liters
   - Wean down vent settings as much as possible, will likely be more
   effective once
   - CXR today to make sure no other acute process is occuring
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s, pressor changed
   from levophed to neo without any effect, her BP dropped with IV dilt,
   so started amiodarone morning of [**11-24**] due to continued pressor
   requirement
   - Continue amio gtt as HR has improved, but she is still tachycardic in
   the low 100
   - Monitor for improvement and hopeful d/c of amio once patient is
   extubated and off sedation
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolveing, T max was yesterday at 1600; appears to
   be improving.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**5-19**] of zosyn. Day
   1: [**11-22**].
   - f/u speciation and sensitivities from prior blood cx
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs,
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - no need for pressors now. Monitor maps > 65.
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr improving to 1.5 today, baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Stable. Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion
   of HIT as timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior
   heparin exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia
   - Continue to hold vanc/heparin
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   - If platelets remain stable or increase tomorrow would restart heparin
   as HIT is very unlikely
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Bicarb 24 today, extubation will be facilitated by resolution of
   acidosis.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal carcinoma, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current assessment includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated due to acute respiratory distress and unable to wean effectively. The cause of respiratory failure is not primary lung-related but likely secondary to fluid resuscitation leading to fluid overload, as seen on the chest X-ray. The plan is to monitor urine output, wean down ventilator settings, and perform a chest X-ray to check for any other acute processes.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial on [11-23]. Despite pressor changes, the patient's heart rate remained high. Amiodarone was started in the morning of [11-24] due to continued pressor requirement. The plan is to continue amio gtt as the heart rate has improved but the patient is still tachycardic in the low 100s. Monitoring for improvement is essential, and the hope is to discontinue amio once the patient is extubated and off sedation.

   been doing well on the ventilator, had hoped to extubate her yesterday,
   however she went into A.fib with RVR during her [**Last Name (LF) 1324**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] she was
   intially changed back to A/C, then transitioned back to PSV.
   - RSBI early this morning
patient very tachypnei,
   -Chest x-ray appeared volume overloaded, which is likely contributing
   to the difficulty weaning her off the ventilator, when patient is able
   to be weaned off pressors will need diuresis.  Hopefully patient will
   start to mobilize her extra fluid, however once off pressors if she is
   unable to, will give lasix as needed to help decrease the fluid in her
   lungs
   - Hopeful extubation today pending ability to diurese

   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - With increasing leukocytosis concern for a new infection, will
   reculture blood, urine and sputum, also send a C.diff when patient has
   a bowel movement, if LFT
s increase, will reimage RUQ due to concern
   for possible blockage of stent
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; f/u speciation and
   sensitivities from prior blood cx
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs, especially in the setting on increasing
   leukocytosis, will add on Diff to AM labs
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - Wean neo as tolerated by MAP >= 60 mmHg
   # ARF: Likely related to sepsis and intravascular volume depletion
   secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also likely some component of ATN
   as her renal function has not improved as quickly with fluids as would
   be expected in a purely pre-renal picture. Cr improving to 1.5 today,
   baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Titrate MAP to greater than 60, unless urine output decreases then
   will titrate to increased MAP
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion of HIT as
   timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior heparin
   exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia.  Platelets slightly increased today.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED.
   Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to fluid resuscitation; as
   fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Monitor UOP as patient is auto-diuresing well. Check i/o
s this
   evening with TBB 1-1.5 liters
   - Wean down vent settings as much as possible, will likely be more
   effective once
   - CXR today to make sure no other acute process is occuring
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s, pressor changed
   from levophed to neo without any effect, her BP dropped with IV dilt,
   so started amiodarone morning of [**11-24**] due to continued pressor
   requirement
   - Continue amio gtt as HR has improved, but she is still tachycardic in
   the low 100
   - Monitor for improvement and hopeful d/c of amio once patient is
   extubated and off sedation
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolveing, T max was yesterday at 1600; appears to
   be improving.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**5-19**] of zosyn. Day
   1: [**11-22**].
   - f/u speciation and sensitivities from prior blood cx
   - Trend CBC/diff, LFTs,
   - Follow up blood cx speciation , urine cx with no growth
   - no need for pressors now. Monitor maps > 65.
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr improving to 1.5 today, baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia Stable. Likely secondary to sepsis. Low suscipicion
   of HIT as timing does not correlate since patient has not had a prior
   heparin exposure.  Vancomycin may also be contributing to her
   thrombocytopenia
   - Continue to hold vanc/heparin
   - No signs of active bleeding
   - Transfuse for less than 10,000 or 30,000 for procedure
   - If platelets remain stable or increase tomorrow would restart heparin
   as HIT is very unlikely
   # Mixed Anion gap (lactic acid)/Non-anion gap (NS and diarrhea)
   acidosis:  Gap has closed. Lactate normalized.
    - Bicarb 24 today, extubation will be facilitated by resolution of
   acidosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presents with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She underwent ERCP and stent placement. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU. Her current medications include midazolam, amiodarone, fentanyl, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator suggests ongoing respiratory failure. This may be due to fluid overload or another acute process.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial, which has not resolved despite amiodarone treatment.
3. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis. Although her white blood cell count is trending down, she may still be at risk for further complications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function has not improved quickly, indicating possible acute kidney injury. This could be related to sepsis, intravascular volume depletion, or a component of acute tubular necrosis.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which could be secondary to sepsis or vancomycin therapy."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of choledocholithiasis, dementia, and renal cancer. She presents with septic shock and cholangitis, following an ERCP with stent placement, and is now experiencing respiratory failure requiring persistent ventilator support.

The patient has been critically ill, with significant medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function is compromised due to septic shock and cholangitis. Continuous monitoring and management of oxygenation, ventilation, and weaning from the ventilator will be necessary.

2. Volume Overload: The patient is likely experiencing volume overload, which may contribute to worsening respiratory failure. Careful fluid balance management is required to prevent further fluid accumulation.

3. Infection and Sepsis: The patient is currently off pressors, indicating improvement from septic shock. However, ongoing monitoring for signs of infection and sepsis is crucial, especially since the patient is still receiving antibiotics and awaiting culture results.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, for which she is receiving amiodarone. Continuous cardiac monitoring and careful assessment of heart rhythm are essential to ensure stable cardiac function.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, but there are no signs of active bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet count and careful consideration for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a medical history of choledocholithiasis, dementia, and renal cancer. She presents with septic shock, cholangitis, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has received various treatments and interventions. She is on multiple medications including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), midazolam (Versed), amiodarone, fentanyl, and others.

The vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius (100.4 degrees Fahrenheit), heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 111/67 to 127/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and low platelet count. There are also abnormalities in liver function tests and electrolyte levels.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to volume overload, septic shock that is now off pressors, atrial fibrillation being managed with amiodarone, and thrombocytopenia which is stable without active bleeding. The patient is also awaiting culture results and has shown improvements in liver function tests after an ERCP procedure.

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure does not appear [**3-13**] primary
   lung process, as CXR is rather unimpressive, but in the setting of her
   metabolic acidosis she was hyperventilating to compensate and
   fatigued. Becoming acutely SOB and requiring intubation in the ED.
   Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to fluid resuscitation; as
   fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Monitor UOP as patient is auto-diuresing well. Check i/o
s this
   evening with TBB 1-1.5 liters, if not at goal will trial some lasix if
   her blood pressure can tolerate
   - Wean down vent settings as much as possible, but having difficulty
   due to volume overload
   - CXR tomorrow morning to evaluate for improvement in volume overload
   - will further clarify intubation status with family prior to
   extubation, to see if they would want her to be re-intubated if she has
   difficulty post extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Patient has
   remained tachycardic on amio gtt, now that she is off pressors will
   trial a low dose beta blocker,
   - Metoprolol 5mg IV: monitor effect on HR and BP, has been on
   metoprolol at home
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count trending down.
   Lactate now normal. Initial sepsis likely secondary to biliary source
   given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolving
white count almost normalized, has been
   afebrile for over 24hours
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**6-18**] of zosyn. Day
   1: [**11-22**].  Will f/u cutlure data to see if we can narrow our coverage,
   if she needs to be continued on Zosyn will place a PICC and pull
   central line
   - LFT
s normalized, no longer need to trend daily
   - plan for repeat ERCP in one month, after resolution of initial
   infection for stone break up and removal
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr improving to 1.5 today, baseline creatinine 1.2-1.4.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Stable, and her platelet count is increasing. Likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Will restart SQ heparin as her platelet count has increased and the
   initial drop was not consistent with HIT
   - No signs of active bleeding
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Was npo after midnight for possible extubation, but since
   she will not be extubated will restart tube feeds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal carcinoma, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure does not appear to be a primary lung process. However, her hyperventilation to compensate for metabolic acidosis has led to fatigue and acute shortness of breath, requiring intubation in the emergency department. She is unable to wean effectively due to fluid resuscitation, resulting in fluid overload seen on the chest X-ray.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced her first episode of atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial on [11-23]. Her heart rate initially ranged from 110 to 130 beats per minute. She is currently being monitored for the effect of amiodarone on heart rate and blood pressure. Metoprolol 5mg IV will be given to further manage her heart rate.

3. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pus and a very large stone, and the patient underwent stent placement. She is currently afebrile, and her white count is"

 Respiratory Failure
   - continues to do poorly with decreased support, possibly due to

   - will follow TBB as she is autodiuresing, goal TBB -1L
   - low suspicion for underlying pneumonia given improving infectious
   parameters and shock
   - will continue PS today, repeat lightening of sedation and SBT
   tomorrow morning
 Septic shock
   - s/p ERCP with cholangitis
   - called micro for speciation of organisms, narrow abx if able
   - shock resolved, creatinine improved
   - on day [**6-18**] Zosyn
 Atrial fibrillation
   - continues to be tachycardic, though improved
   - can try low dose beta-blocker today if BP tolerates
   - consider d'c amiodarone if able to be on beta-blocker
 Acute renal failure
   - improved overall
   - some of urine output now may be post-ATN diuresis
 Thrombocytopenia
   - slightly improved, no evidence of bleeding

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of dementia and renal cancer who presented with septic shock and cholangitis. She underwent ERCP and stenting, but her condition was complicated by respiratory failure.

From the progress note, the following medical complications can arise:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient continues to do poorly with decreased support, possibly due to ongoing volume overload. She is autodiuresing, and the goal is to achieve a target body weight loss of 1 liter. There is a low suspicion for underlying pneumonia given improving infectious parameters and shock. The patient will continue with pressure support today, with plans to repeat a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow morning.

2. Septic Shock: The patient had septic shock secondary to cholangitis post ERCP. Organism speciation was called for, and narrow-spectrum antibiotics were considered if able. The shock resolved, and creatinine levels improved. The patient has been on day [**6-18**] Zosyn.

3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient continues to be tachycardic, although improved. A low-dose beta-blocker can be tried today if blood pressure tolerates. Consideration for d'c amiodarone if able to be on beta-blocker will be made.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function has improved overall, and some of the urine output now may"

   Imaging:
   Chest X-Ray [**11-27**] (my read): slightly worsening left effusion and right
   basilar patchy opacity
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure initially thought to be due
   to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate
   to compensate and fatigued, becoming acutely SOB and requiring
   intubation in the ED. Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to
   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Net goal yesterday was -1 to 1.5L, patient was only net negative
   about 800 cc
s in the evening so she was given 20mg IV lasix with a
   brisk urine output response.  Will give another dose of lasix since she
   had her best SBT with the increased diuresis, hold tube feeds for now
   in case she is able to be extubated this afternoon.  She will likely
   never have an excellent RSBI, but she will need to not tire and
   maintain her sats during her SBT.
   - Hold sedation for now to optimize mental status prior to extubation
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to place a dobhoff prior to extubation as she may be an
   aspiration risk
   - CXR looks stable to slightly worsened this morning
   - family okay with re-intubation if patient fails extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Trialed
   metoprolol 12.5mg PO yesterday, with some improvement in HR to the
   100
s and her BP tolerated it well.
   - Increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrate up to good HR control as
   her BP tolerates
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count stable. Lactate
   normal. Initial sepsis secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation
   with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolving
white count almost normalized.  Had been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**2174-7-19**] of zosyn.
   Day 1=[**11-22**].  Will f/u cutlure data to see if we can narrow our
   coverage, if she needs to be continued on Zosyn will place a PICC and
   pull central line, may be able to transitioned to a po antibiotic
   - plan for repeat ERCP in one month, after resolution of initial
   infection for stone break up and removal
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr back to her baseline at 1.3 today.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine while diuresing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Stable, and her platelet count is increasing. Likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Platelet count stable and increasing

She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to primary metabolic acidosis, causing hyperventilation and subsequent fatigue. She required intubation in the emergency department. The inability to effectively wean off the ventilator was likely due to fluid resuscitation, resulting in fluid overload seen on chest X-ray.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial on November 23rd, initially with rates around 110 bpm and then increasing to 130 bpm. Metoprolol was trialed at 12.5 mg PO, resulting in an improvement in heart rate to the 100s. The dose of metoprolol will be increased to 25 mg and titrated up for better heart rate control, as her blood pressure tolerates it.

   Imaging:
   Chest X-Ray [**11-27**] (my read): slightly worsening left effusion and right
   basilar patchy opacity
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure initially thought to be due
   to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate
   to compensate and fatigued, becoming acutely SOB and requiring
   intubation in the ED. Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to
   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Net goal yesterday was -1 to 1.5L, patient was only net negative
   about 800 cc
s in the evening so she was given 20mg IV lasix with a
   brisk urine output response
   - Wean down vent settings as much as possible, but having difficulty
   due to volume overload
   - CXR looks stable to slightly worsened this morning
   - family okay with re-intubation if patient fails extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Trialed
   metoprolol 12.5mg PO yesterday, with some improvement in HR to the
   100
s and her BP tolerated it well.
   - Increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrate up to good HR control as
   her BP tolerates
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count stable. Lactate
   normal. Initial sepsis secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation
   with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolving
white count almost normalized.  Had been
   afebrile for 24 hours, this morning with low grade temps.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**7-19**] of zosyn. Day
   1: [**11-22**].  Will f/u cutlure data to see if we can narrow our coverage,
   if she needs to be continued on Zosyn will place a PICC and pull
   central line
   - plan for repeat ERCP in one month, after resolution of initial
   infection for stone break up and removal
   - will send sputum cx with new low grade temps, and slightly worsening
   chest x-ray
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr back to her baseline at 1.3 today.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Stable, and her platelet count is increasing. Likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Will restart SQ heparin as her platelet count has increased and the
   initial drop was not consistent with HIT
   - No signs of active bleeding

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, complicated by acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Dyspnea/Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to primary metabolic acidosis, leading to hyperventilation and subsequent acute shortness of breath requiring intubation. She was unable to be weaned off the ventilator effectively, likely due to fluid overload seen on the chest X-ray. The goal is to wean down vent settings while managing fluid overload.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient developed atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial on [**11-23**], with heart rates ranging from 110 to 130 beats per minute. Metoprolol 12.5mg PO was tried with some improvement in heart rate to around 100 beats per minute. The plan is to increase metoprolol to 25mg and titrate up to achieve good heart rate control while monitoring blood pressure.

3. Septic Shock: The patient likely experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pus and a large stone, and she underwent stent"

   Imaging:
   Chest X-Ray [**11-27**] at 2330 (my read): stable [**Month/Year (2) **] effusion/opacity  and
   RLL patchy opacity
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure initially thought to be due
   to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate
   to compensate and fatigued, becoming acutely SOB and requiring
   intubation in the ED. Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to
   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.  Patient is
   having difficulty coming off PEEP, becomes very tachypneic and has low
   tidal volumes, which is more concerning for difficulty with compliance
   and volume overload.  Additionally, patient with [**Month/Year (2) **] opacity and
   diaphragm pulled up on the left that has been noted on all x-rays
   during this admission, to better see the anatomy in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**]
   bronch the patient this afternoon to look at the [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - continue with net negative goal, if UOP decreases to less than
   100cc/hr will give another dose of lasix and readdress possible
   extubation this afternoon.
   - Hold sedation for now to optimize mental status prior to extubation
   - NGT in place for meds/diet post extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Trialed
   metoprolol 12.5mg PO yesterday, with some improvement in HR to the
   100
s and her BP tolerated it well.
   - Metoprolol increased to 25mg TID, but patient still tachycardic in
   the 120
s to 130
s, so will trial an esmolol drip
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient off pressors, likely secondary to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, complicated by acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate and become acutely short of breath, requiring intubation in the emergency department. She has been unable to wean effectively from mechanical ventilation, likely due to fluid resuscitation leading to fluid overload seen on chest X-ray. The patient is having difficulty coming off positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), becoming very tachypneic, and producing low tidal volumes, indicating difficulty with lung compliance and volume overload.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient experienced atrial fibrillation during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) on [**11-23**], with heart rates in the 110s, then increasing to the 130s. Metoprolol 12.5mg PO was tried with some improvement in HR to the 100s, and her blood pressure tolerated it well. Metoprolol has been increased to 25mg TID, but the patient remains tachycardic in the 120s to"

   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure initially thought to be due
   to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate
   to compensate and fatigued, becoming acutely SOB and requiring
   intubation in the ED. Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to
   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.
   - Net goal yesterday was -1 to 1.5L, patient was only net negative
   about 800 cc
s in the evening so she was given 20mg IV lasix with a
   brisk urine output response.  Will give another dose of lasix since she
   had her best SBT with the increased diuresis, hold tube feeds for now
   in case she is able to be extubated this afternoon.  She will likely
   never have an excellent RSBI, but she will need to not tire and
   maintain her sats during her SBT.
   - Hold sedation for now to optimize mental status prior to extubation
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need to place a dobhoff prior to extubation as she may be an
   aspiration risk
   - CXR looks stable to slightly worsened this morning
   - family okay with re-intubation if patient fails extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Trialed
   metoprolol 12.5mg PO yesterday, with some improvement in HR to the
   100
s and her BP tolerated it well.
   - Increase metoprolol to 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and titrate up to good HR control as
   her BP tolerates
   # Septic shock:  Likely secondary to cholangitis and infected
   stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand very large stone, she is
   s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and white count stable. Lactate
   normal. Initial sepsis secondary to biliary source given CBD dilation
   with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting on known
   choledocholithiasis. No other source of infection found.
   - Leukocytosis is resolving
white count almost normalized.  Had been
   afebrile for over 24 hours.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**2174-7-19**] of zosyn.
   Day 1=[**11-22**].  Will f/u cutlure data to see if we can narrow our
   coverage, if she needs to be continued on Zosyn will place a PICC and
   pull central line, may be able to transitioned to a po antibiotic
   - plan for repeat ERCP in one month, after resolution of initial
   infection for stone break up and removal
   - f/u sputum culture
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr back to her baseline at 1.3 today.
   - Monitor UOP
   - Trend creatinine while diuresing
   - Check PM lytes
   .
   #Thrombocytopenia: Stable, and her platelet count is increasing. Likely
   secondary to sepsis.
   - Platelet count stable and increasing

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia.
- She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, leading to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis.
- The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement.
- She was intubated in the emergency department due to respiratory failure and has been unable to be weaned off the ventilator effectively.
- The net goal yesterday was to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1 to 1.5 liters, but the patient only had a negative fluid balance of about 800 cc in the evening.
- Lasix was given twice to help with diuresis and improve the fluid balance.
- The patient's best spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) occurred with increased diuresis, so another dose of lasix will be given.
- Tube feeds have been held for now in case the patient can be extubated this afternoon.
- The patient may have an increased risk of aspiration post-extubation due to mental status, so a Dobhoff tube may be placed prior to extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement. She has been improving and is now off pressors, with a stable white blood cell count and normal lactate levels. The patient's atrial fibrillation is being controlled with metoprolol and diltiazem. She has resolved thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. The plan is to trial extubation today, with the possibility of using bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) post-extubation. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), but re-intubation may be considered if she fails extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation: The patient has been unable to effectively breathe on her own after intubation in the emergency department, indicating a potential complication with weaning from mechanical ventilation. This may be due to several factors, including fluid overload seen on the chest X-ray.
2. Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The chest X-ray shows markedly enlarged pulmonary arteries, consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This could contribute to further respiratory complications.
3. Pleural effusion: The chest X-ray also shows a left pleural effusion,"

   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.  Patient is
   having difficulty coming off PEEP, becomes very tachypneic and has low
   tidal volumes, which is more concerning for difficulty with compliance
   and volume overload.  Additionally, patient with [**Month/Year (2) **] opacity and

   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as

","The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal carcinoma, and dementia who presented with dyspnea and vomiting, leading to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She underwent ERCP and stent placement.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- She remains intubated with difficulty weaning off the ventilator, possibly due to fluid overload.
- She has a left pleural effusion with atelectasis, which has not changed.
- Her right lung is clear, and there is no pulmonary edema.
- She has markedly enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
- Her blood culture showed anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative rods.
- Her atrial fibrillation rates have improved with metoprolol and esmolol drip.
- She is resolving from septic shock, likely secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge.
- Her renal function has improved near baseline.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team should monitor for signs of infection and implement a VAP bundle to prevent its occurrence.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT. The patient is receiving prophylactic SQ hepar"

   terminating 3.2 cm above the carina. The right internal jugular line
   ends in the mid superior vena cava. Left pleural effusion with
   atelectasis have not changed. Pulmonary arteries are markedly enlarged,
   consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The right lung is
   clear. There is no pulmonary edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   85yo F with a h/o choledocholithiasis, HTN, renal CA, and dementia who
   presents with dyspnea and vomiting complicated by acute respiratory
   failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She is s/p
   ERCP and stent.
   .
   # Dyspnea/respiratory failure: Resp failure initially thought to be due
   to her primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate
   to compensate and fatigued, becoming acutely SOB and requiring
   intubation in the ED. Unable to wean effectively; likely secondary to
   fluid resuscitation; as fluid overload is seen on CXR.  Patient is
   having difficulty coming off PEEP, becomes very tachypneic and has low
   tidal volumes, which is more concerning for difficulty with compliance
   and volume overload.  Additionally, patient with [**Month/Year (2) **] opacity and
   diaphragm pulled up on the left that has been noted on all x-rays
   during this admission, to better see the anatomy in the [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**]
   bronch the patient this afternoon to look at the [**First Name3 (LF) **].
   - continue with net negative goal, if UOP decreases to less than
   100cc/hr will give another dose of lasix and readdress possible
   extubation this afternoon.
   - Hold sedation for now to optimize mental status prior to extubation
   - NGT in place for meds/diet post extubation
   # Atrial Fibrillation: First occurred during SBT on [**11-23**], initially
   rates were in the 110
s, then increased to the 130
s.  Trialed
   metoprolol 12.5mg PO yesterday, with some improvement in HR to the
   100
s and her BP tolerated it well.
   - Metoprolol increased to 25mg TID, but patient still tachycardic in
   the 120
s to 130
s, so will trial an esmolol drip
   # Septic shock: resolving, patient off pressors, likely secondary to
   cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pusand
   very large stone, she is s/p stent placement. Patient afebrile and
   white count stable. Lactate normal. Initial sepsis secondary to biliary
   source given CBD dilation with sludge and obstructive LFTs in setting
   on known choledocholithiasis.
   - Leukocytosis is resolving
white count almost normalized.  Had been
   afebrile for over 48 hours.
   - Cont zosyn pending any further culture data; Day [**8-22**] of zosyn. Day
   1=[**11-22**].  Will f/u cutlure data to see if we can narrow our coverage,
   will place a PICC and pull central line
   - plan for repeat ERCP in one month, after resolution of initial
   infection for stone break up and removal
   .
   # ARF: Improved, near baseline. Likely related to sepsis and
   intravascular volume depletion secondary to vomiting and diarrhea, also
   likely some component of ATN as her renal function has not improved as
   quickly with fluids as would be expected in a purely pre-renal picture.
   Cr back to near her baseline at 1.5 today, will tolerate a bump in Cr
   to help with further diruesis
   - Monitor UOP
   - Check PM lytes

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which complicated into acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She underwent ERCP and stent placement. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She also has atrial fibrillation and thrombocytopenia, which have since resolved. Her renal function has improved, but she still has fluid overload and needs further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation: The patient has been unable to be effectively extubated, likely due to fluid resuscitation leading to fluid overload. This indicates a potential complication related to respiratory failure.
2. Volume overload: The patient has evidence of fluid overload on chest X-ray and is currently at goal intake/output with an imbalance of 784 mL total in. This suggests a risk for worsening volume overload.
3. Pulmonary arterial hypertension: The chest X-ray shows markedly enlarged pulmonary arteries consistent with pulmonary arterial hypertension. This condition may worsen over time and require further evaluation and management.
4. Potential infection: The blood cultures showed anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative rods, which are suggestive of an infection. Further identification and treatment are necessary to address this potential complication.

   Agree with excellent medical student note with the following addition:
   The patient was on long acting metoprolol at a dose of 100mg daily
   prior to admission.  She would benefit from continuing the beta-blocker
   rather than the calcium channel blocker for coronary artery disease
   history.  She will likely need to be titrated up on the metoprolol to
   at least her prior home dose but likely higher.
   The patient is doing well on 2L NC this AM and is ready to be
   transferred to the floor.
   She passed her speech and swallow study.  Her NG tube will be pulled
   today, and her diet will be advanced.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which required intubation. Although she has been extubated successfully, there is a risk of respiratory complications due to her history of acute respiratory failure.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is taking metoprolol and diltiazem. However, her blood pressure is low on both medications, indicating a potential complication related to rate control.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had thrombocytopenia initially, but it has resolved. There is a possibility of recurrence if there are ongoing platelet consumption or sepsis-related issues.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is improving, but there is still a risk of ARF due to her history of renal cancer and possible pre-existing kidney damage.

5. Cholangitis: Although the patient underwent ERCP and stent placement, there is a possibility of recurrent cholangitis if there are persistent biliary tract infections or obstructions.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is at risk for developing DVT and PE due to immobilization and her underlying medical conditions.

7. Infection: The patient had septic shock secondary to cholangitis, and there is a risk of developing new infections, especially in the ICU setting.

8. Beta-blocker therapy adjustment: The patient's beta-blocker therapy needs to be adjusted due to her coronary artery disease history."

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia who presented with dyspnea and vomiting. She was initially treated for acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely secondary to cholangitis. She underwent an ERCP procedure and stent placement. The patient has since improved and is now awake, responsive, and following commands. She is off pressors and has stable vital signs. Her white blood cell count is within normal range, and her lactate levels are normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to primary metabolic acidosis, which caused her to hyperventilate and fatigue. This led to acute shortness of breath and required intubation in the emergency department. There is a possibility of weaning off the ventilator successfully.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control. The rate has been stable at around 110 beats per minute with both medications. However, there may be tachycardia related to intubation and agitation. Close monitoring of blood pressure and ongoing titration of medication will be necessary.

3. Septic Shock: The patient initially experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis and infected stone/sludge. However, she has resolved from the initial source of infection,"

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which led to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely due to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement. She is currently intubated and being weaned off mechanical ventilation. She has atrial fibrillation, for which she is receiving metoprolol and diltiazem. Her septic shock has resolved, and she is off pressors. She will be extubated today and may require BiPAP post-extubation. She has a nasogastric tube in place for medication and diet post-extubation.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure, which required intubation. There is a possibility of failed extubation, requiring re-intubation.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control medications are being administered. However, there is a risk of uncontrolled heart rate or development of other cardiac complications.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient had thrombocytopenia in the past but has since resolved. There is still a potential risk of bleeding due to low platelet count.
4. Infection: Although the patient's septic shock has resolved, there is still a risk of infection, especially since"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old female with a history of choledocholithiasis, hypertension, renal cancer, and dementia. She presented with dyspnea and vomiting, which led to acute respiratory failure and septic shock likely due to cholangitis. The patient underwent ERCP and stent placement. She is currently on invasive ventilation but has shown improvement in her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to primary metabolic acidosis, leading to hyperventilation. She required intubation in the emergency department and was unable to be effectively weaned off the ventilator. This may be due to fluid resuscitation, resulting in fluid overload as seen on the chest X-ray. The patient will be trialed for extubation today, with the possibility of using bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) post-extubation.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has developed atrial fibrillation, for which she is being treated with metoprolol at 25mg TID and diltiazem at 30mg QID for rate control. Her heart rate has been in the 90s with both medications.

3. Septic shock: The patient initially experienced septic shock secondary to cholangitis and an infected stone/sludge. ERCP showed significant pus and a large stone, and a stent was placed. The patient is now a"
