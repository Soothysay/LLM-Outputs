","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who is experiencing hypoxia with oxygen saturation in the low 90s. They have undergone a bone marrow biopsy and received Lasix for fluid management. Despite these measures, the patient's calcium levels continue to rise, reaching 18.8 this morning. The patient is not tolerating BiPAP and continues to remove the mask. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium level is significantly elevated at 18.8 mg/dL, indicating hypercalcemia. This condition can lead to various complications such as kidney stones, kidney dysfunction, bone pain, and cardiac arrhythmias.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine and BUN levels suggest acute renal failure. This condition can be caused by factors like dehydration, medication toxicity, or underlying kidney disease. It is characterized by decreased urine output and impaired kidney function.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low at 7.7 g/dL, indicating anemia. Anemia can result in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.
4. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by airway inflammation and bronchospasm. It can lead to symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old individual with a chief complaint of hypoxia. They underwent a bone marrow biopsy, which is pending pathology results. The patient has a history of asthma and is currently receiving home asthma medications. Overnight, the patient became hypoxic with oxygen saturation levels in the low 90s. Lasix 40mg IV was administered, followed by 80mg IV, and the patient was switched from CPAP to BiPAP. Despite these interventions, the patient's calcium levels continued to rise, reaching 18.8 this morning. The patient is not tolerating BiPAP and continues to remove the mask.

Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient is struggling to adapt to the ICU environment and cope with their medical condition.
2. Hypercalcemia: The patient's calcium levels are abnormally high at 18.8 mg/dL. This could be due to various reasons such as malignancy or renal dysfunction.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, as indicated by the elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output.
4. Anemia: The patient has a low hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, indicating anemia.
5. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma, which may contribute to respiratory symptoms and require specific management in the ICU setting.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's intolerance to"

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, recent dental infection, and rib fractures presenting with progressive malaise, hypercalcemia, renal failure, hyperuricemia, and an abnormal differential count suggestive of a new malignancy diagnosis. The constellation of symptoms is likely explained by severe hypercalcemia. 

Preliminary read of bone marrow biopsy suggests aplastic myeloma. The patient's calcium level is elevated at 18.8 mg/dL, and other lab results show abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, and abnormal electrolyte levels.

The patient's respiratory status is also concerning, with increasing oxygen requirement and evidence of pulmonary edema. A murmur on examination raises the possibility of underlying valvular disease. 

Hyperuricemia is likely due to cell turnover in the setting of dehydration and may be complicated by tumor lysis syndrome. The patient has acute kidney injury, which is likely a combination of hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia as a component of tumor lysis, and poor oral intake. 

Further investigations are pending, including SPEP/UPEP, vitamin D 25 and 1,25 levels, B2 globulin, and kappa/lambda levels. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of various complications including hypercalcemia, respiratory distress, hyperuricemia, renal failure, and potential malignancy"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, recent dental infection, and rib fractures. He presented with progressive malaise and was found to have hypercalcemia, renal failure, hyperuricemia, and an abnormal differential count suggestive of a new malignancy diagnosis. Multiple myeloma is suspected, but lymphoma/leukemia are also in the differential. The patient has altered mental status, renal failure, and thrombocytopenia consistent with TTP, but without schistocytes on smear, excluding the diagnosis. Severe hypercalcemia is likely responsible for the constellation of symptoms.

The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increasing oxygen requirements and potential pulmonary edema. A murmur on examination suggests underlying valvular disease. Lasix has been given to manage fluid overload. The patient is currently on BiPAP but is unable to tolerate it, with O2 sats around 90%. Intubation may be necessary if O2 sats fall further. Infiltrates on chest X-ray are noted.

Hyperuricemia is likely due to cell turnover in the setting of dehydration and elevated LDH. Allopurinol has been started to manage this condition. Acute kidney injury is likely due to a combination of factors, including hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia as part of tumor lysis, and poor PO intake. Renal replacement therapy may be required for calcium and uric acid"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with a history of asthma, chronic low back pain, rib fractures from mild trauma, and a recent dental abscess. He presented with malaise, shortness of breath, and was found to be anemic, with low platelet count compared to one year ago. He also had high calcium levels and increased creatinine. The patient received pamidronate, started on IV normal saline at 200cc/hr, and was given lasix every six hours. He had good urine output, with an input of 4200 mL and output of 5800 mL overnight. He experienced increasing respiratory distress and was concerned for pulmonary edema, so he was placed on bipap. The patient is being seen by renal and hem onc, and a bone marrow biopsy was done yesterday, with preliminary results consistent with myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's increasing respiratory distress and concern for pulmonary edema indicate a possible complication related to his respiratory system. Further evaluation and management are necessary to address this issue.

2. Myeloma: The preliminary results of the bone marrow biopsy are consistent with myeloma, which is a type of blood cancer that affects plasma cells. This condition can lead to various complications such as anemia, bone pain, infections, and organ damage.

3. Hypercalcemia: The patient"

   TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary
   and outflow tract gradient is identified without dynamic resting LVOT
   obstruction (high output state). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
   transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion
   CT Chest/Abd (WET READ):
   Multiple lucent lesions through all osseous structurs most consistent
   with
   myeloma. No lymphadenopathy. Diffuse ground glass/nodular lung
   opacities-?
   atypical infection. Perhaps a component of superimposed pulmonary
   edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   47M with a history asthma, recent dental infection, recent rib
   fracures, now presents with progressive malaise in setting of
   hypercalcemia, renal failure, hyperuricemia, and abnormal differential
   which is highly suggestive of a new malignancy diagnosis.  Would favor
   multiple myeloma as most likely, although lymphoma/leukemia are in
   differential.  Altered mental status, renal failure and
   thrombocytopenia c/w TTP but no schistocytes on smear excluding dx.
   Overall constellation of symptoms is likely explained by severe
   hypercalcemia.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Suspected malignancy given the degree of
   hypercalcemia. Admission calcium is 17.7 with an ionized calcium of
   2.13. Not on HCTZ, not taking vitamin D, and not taking calcium.
   Preliminary read of BM biopsy suggests anaplastic myeloma. PTH = 8,
   SPEP/UPEP, vitamin D 25 and 1,25, B2 globulin and kappa/lambda levels
   pending.
   - continue IVF with normal saline at 200cc/hr
   - Furosemide 80mg q 12 hours based on nephrology recommendations
   - Trend [**Year (4 digits) **], electrolytes
   - One dose pamidronate on [**4-15**]
   - Calcitonin -> written for 3 doses
   - Trend calcium Q8H for now
   - f/u ACE Level
   - F/U final heme report
   - Check EKG this AM for changes
   .
   # Respiratory Status/volume: Increasing O2 requirement in setting of
   volume resuscitation.  Likely pulmonary edema.  Potentially underlying
   valvular disease given murmur on exam.  Lasix as needed.  Got 20mg IV
   lasix on floor -> unclear what [**Name (NI) **] was to that dose, but lasix naive.
   Increased SOB overnight
 unable to tolerate BiPAP. Currently O2 sats
   ~90%. [**Month (only) 8**] require intubation if O2 sats fall, increased work of
   breathing. ? Infiltrates on CXR.
   - lasix PRN
   - Contiue fluticasone, albuterol inhalers
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u blood cultures (NGTD)
   - check sputum cx
   - continue antibiotics for presumed CAP, ceftriaxone/azithromycin
   .
   # Hyperuricemia: Likely due to cell turn over given elevated LDH, in
   setting of dehydration. Complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and likely contributing to
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   - continue allopurinol 100mg daily
   - serum pH remains alkalemic so will defer bicarbonate infusion.
   - trend pH
   - follow [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Acute kidney injury: Likely combination of hypercalcemia,
   hyperuricemia as a component of tumor lysis, and poor POs.  If tumor is
   of plasma cell origin, immunoglobulins may also play a role.  Continues
   to make good urine.
   - Renal following
 will F/U recs; if creatinine worsens, will likely
   require renal biopsy
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require HD for calcium, uric acid, possible tumor lysis
   - Moderate UEos, etiology unclear. Stopping all nonessential meds
   - Lasix 80 mg IV BID or PRN
   - Check urine albumin, creatinine, total protein
   - will continue IVF with goal TBB even
   .
   # Likely cancer diagnosis:  Labs pending as above. PSA = 0.3. ESR, CRP
   elevated. EBV Antibody Panel, CMV IgG/IgM Antibody Panel, and
   Toxoplasma IgG/IgM Antibody Panel pending given atypical lymphocytes on
   smear all ordered. Will likely need treatment for underlying malignancy
   soon
 prelim Bx suggests anaplastic myeloma.
   - Heme onc following
 appreciate recs; will obtain final reads on
   imaging to eval for lymphadenopathy.  CT scan concerning for multiple
   lytic lesions but no LAD
   - Continue dexamethasone x 4 days
   - f/u Skeletal survey
   .
   # Anemia: Likely due to a bone marrow process. No evidence of TTP or
   intravascular hemolysis. Elevated haptoglobin and ferritin.
   - Likely marrow failure
   - Type and screen up to date, cross match one unit as will likely need
   blood after IVFs given
   - Transfuse for H/H < [**7-25**]
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # Hypertension: Continue to follow.  Treat accordingly.
   .
   # Asthma:
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN
   .
   # OSA
   - will continue home CPAP machine and settings

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, recent dental infection, recent rib fractures, presenting with progressive malaise, hypercalcemia, renal failure, hyperuricemia, and abnormal differential count. The patient has multiple diffuse lytic lesions consistent with myeloma, evidence of lung disease in the bases concerning for atypical infection, and a preliminary read of BM biopsy suggesting anaplastic myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercalcemia: The patient has a high calcium level which can lead to complications such as renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone pain.
2. Renal failure: The patient has impaired kidney function, which may be due to hypercalcemia, dehydration, or tumor lysis syndrome. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Hyperuricemia: The patient has high levels of uric acid, which can lead to gout, kidney stones, or renal failure.
4. Anemia: The patient's low red blood cell count may be due to a bone marrow process. This can lead to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
5. Atypical infection: The patient has evidence of lung disease in the bases concerning for atypical infection. This can lead to pneumonia or respiratory failure if not treated promptly.

   TTE: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately
   dilated. The estimated right atrial pressure is 10-20mmHg. Left
   ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Left
   ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A mid-cavitary
   and outflow tract gradient is identified without dynamic resting LVOT
   obstruction (high output state). There is no ventricular septal defect.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There
   is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened. There is no valvular aortic stenosis. The increased
   transaortic velocity is likely related to high cardiac output. No
   aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
   thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion
   CT Chest/Abd (WET READ):
   Multiple lucent lesions through all osseous structurs most consistent
   with
   myeloma. No lymphadenopathy. Diffuse ground glass/nodular lung
   opacities-?
   atypical infection. Perhaps a component of superimposed pulmonary
   edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   47M with a history asthma, recent dental infection, recent rib
   fracures, now presents with progressive malaise in setting of
   hypercalcemia, renal failure, hyperuricemia, and abnormal differential
   which is highly suggestive of a new malignancy diagnosis.  Would favor
   multiple myeloma as most likely, although lymphoma/leukemia are in
   differential.  Altered mental status, renal failure and
   thrombocytopenia c/w TTP but no schistocytes on smear excluding dx.
   Overall constellation of symptoms is likely explained by severe
   hypercalcemia.
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Suspected malignancy given the degree of
   hypercalcemia. Admission calcium is 17.7 with an ionized calcium of
   2.13. Not on HCTZ, not taking vitamin D, and not taking calcium.
   Preliminary read of BM biopsy suggests anaplastic myeloma. PTH = 8,
   SPEP/UPEP, vitamin D 25 and 1,25, B2 globulin and kappa/lambda levels
   pending.  One dose pamidronate on [**4-15**].   Calcitonin -> written for 3
   doses
   - continue IVF and lasix as necessary to maintain [**Month/Year (2) **] 200-300cc/hr
   - Trend calcium Q8H for now
   - f/u ACE Level
   - F/U final heme report
   - Check EKG this AM for changes
   .
   # Respiratory Status/volume: Increasing O2 requirement in setting of
   volume resuscitation.  Likely pulmonary edema.  Potentially underlying
   valvular disease given murmur on exam.  Lasix as needed.  Got 20mg IV
   lasix on floor -> unclear what [**Name (NI) **] was to that dose, but lasix naive.
   Increased SOB overnight
 unable to tolerate BiPAP. Currently O2 sats
   ~90%. [**Month (only) 8**] require intubation if O2 sats fall, increased work of
   breathing. ? Infiltrates on CXR.
   - lasix PRN
   - Contiue fluticasone, albuterol inhalers
   - Trend CXR
   - f/u blood cultures (NGTD)
   - check sputum cx
   - continue antibiotics for presumed CAP, ceftriaxone/azithromycin
   .
   # Hyperuricemia: Likely due to cell turn over given elevated LDH, in
   setting of dehydration. Complicated by [**Last Name (un) **] and likely contributing to
   [**Last Name (un) **].
   - continue allopurinol 100mg daily
   - serum pH remains alkalemic so will defer bicarbonate infusion.
   - trend pH
   - follow [**Last Name (un) **]
   .
   # Acute kidney injury: Likely combination of hypercalcemia,
   hyperuricemia as a component of tumor lysis, and poor POs.  If tumor is
   of plasma cell origin, immunoglobulins may also play a role.  Continues
   to make good urine.
   - Renal following
 will F/U recs; if creatinine worsens, will likely require renal
   biopsy
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require HD for calcium, uric acid, possible tumor lysis
   - Moderate UEos, etiology unclear. Stopping all nonessential meds
   - Lasix 80 mg IV BID or PRN
   - Check urine albumin, creatinine, total protein
   - will continue IVF with goal TBB even
   .
   # Likely cancer diagnosis:  Labs pending as above. PSA = 0.3. ESR, CRP
   elevated. EBV Antibody Panel, CMV IgG/IgM Antibody Panel, and
   Toxoplasma IgG/IgM Antibody Panel pending given atypical lymphocytes on
   smear all ordered. Will likely need treatment for underlying malignancy
   soon
 prelim Bx suggests anaplastic myeloma.
   - Heme onc following
 appreciate recs; will obtain final reads on
   imaging to eval for lymphadenopathy.  CT scan concerning for multiple
   lytic lesions but no LAD
   - Continue dexamethasone x 4 days
   - f/u Skeletal survey
   .
   # Anemia: Likely due to a bone marrow process. No evidence of TTP or
   intravascular hemolysis. Elevated haptoglobin and ferritin.
   - Likely marrow failure
   - Type and screen up to date, cross match one unit as will likely need
   blood after IVFs given
   - Transfuse for H/H < [**7-25**]
   - Guaiac stools.
   .
   # Hypertension: Continue to follow.  Treat accordingly.
   .
   # Asthma:
   - Albuterol and ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN
   .
   # OSA
   - will continue home CPAP machine and settings
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, but ADAT

   -pneumoboots
   -Bowel regimen, PPI
   -Pain management with tylenol PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old man with severe hypercalcemia and acute renal failure. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments for his conditions. The patient's allergies include iodine and medications such as azithromycin and ceftriaxone. His vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/57 mmHg to 158/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94% on nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin without rash, and attentive neurologic status. Lab results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets, but decreased levels of creatinine and potassium. The patient's calcium level is coming down, but his creatinine level is increasing. Other lab results indicate possible infection and multiple myeloma.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypercalcemia: The patient initially presented with severe hypercalcemia, which is a high level of calcium in the blood. Although the calcium level is coming down, there is a risk of complications such as kidney damage or dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, and bone demineralization.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, as indicated by"

   CT TORSO:
   1. Findings most consistent with multiple myeloma with innumerable
   lucent
   lesions seen throughout all visualized osseous structures.
   2. Diffuse ground glass and partially nodular opacities throughout both
   lungs
   is a nonspecific finding, though raises concern for an atypical
   infection;
   pulmonary edema alone is felt less likely.
   3. No lymphadenopathy.
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo M with asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracure,
   who presented with malaise & DOE found to have bony lesions on CT and a
   constellation of hematologic/electrolyte findings consistent with
   multiple myeloma.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Patient with increasing O2 requirement
   in setting of known asthma, fluid therapy, and new right middle lobe
   pneumonia with pulmonary edema. Also with CT chest on [**4-16**] with diffuse
   ground glass opacities.  Patient also with hyperdynamic heart on TTE
   (EF 75%), elevated BNP to 4232, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
   Receiving Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with fluids and now on antibiotics.
   - Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - IVF's to titrate to UOP 200-300cc/hr
   - Levofloxacin & Cefepime, renally dosed, day [**2-12**]
   - O2 to maintain sats >92%
   - CPAP at night at 11cm H2O
   .
   # Multiple Myeloma: Patient with M-protein in both urine & serum
   identified as IgG kappa as well as end-organ dammage manifested as ARF
   and anemia, diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia suggests a
   diagnosis multiple myeloma. Bone marrow biopsy results are positive for
   myeloma, but patient has commenced Dexamethasone therapy as of [**4-16**].
   Normal serum viscosity and patient without signs or symptoms of
   hyperviscosity syndrome, but beta-2 microglobulin was 6.8. EBV/CMV/Toxo
   negative.
   - K/L light chain ratio pending
   - Continue Dexamethasone 40mg IV qday, day [**3-8**]
   - Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of 200-300cc/hr
   - Continue Lasix 80mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - F/U skeletal survey results
   - Oncology following, will guide treatment
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place. PTH low, TSH normal.
   - Goal urine output 200-300cc/hr
   - Continue IV NS as above
   - Lasix as above
   - Dexamethasone as above
   - q6H labs
   - Vitamin D [**1-30**] pending
   - Vitamin D 25 pending
   .
   # Hyperuricemia: Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in
   conjunction with ARF. Received Rasburicase [**4-17**].
   - Continue Allopurinol 100mg daily
   - Brisk UOP as above
   - Avoid HCO3 as it will precipitate calcium & phosphate
   - Repeat tumor lysis labs q6h (rasburicase precautions; uric acid level
   must be measured in green top on ice and spun on a cooled centrifuge)
   .
   # Acute renal insufficiency: Cr 3.5, stable/downtrending from
   yesterday. Renal following. Renal failure is likely tubular injury from
   cast nephropathy in conjunction with hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia.
   - f/u renal recs
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require renal biopsy if function does not improve
   - Continuous IVF's/Lasix to preempt further tubular injury
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin
   & ferritin demonstrating insufficient erythropoeisis.  Likely secondary
   to massive marrow infilitration from multiple myeloma.  No evidence of
   TTP, ITP, or intravascular hemolysis.
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT <25
   - obtain transfusion goals for platelets from BMT service
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Asthma: Continue Albuterol, Fluticasone, & Ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, regular

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic low back pain, and a recent rib fracture.
- He presented with malaise and dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have bony lesions on CT scan, as well as hematologic and electrolyte findings consistent with multiple myeloma.
- The patient is currently experiencing dyspnea/respiratory distress, requiring increased oxygen supplementation. He has a history of asthma, and his symptoms may be exacerbated by fluid therapy and a new right middle lobe pneumonia with pulmonary edema.
- The patient's heart is functioning well, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 75%. He has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 4232, indicating moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. He is receiving Lasix, intravenous fluids (IVF), and antibiotics.
- The patient has multiple myeloma, characterized by M-protein in both urine and serum, identified as IgG kappa. He has end-organ damage manifested as acute renal failure (ARF) and anemia, along with diffuse lytic lesions on CT scan and hypercalcemia.
- Bone marrow biopsy results are positive for myeloma, but the patient has commenced Dexamethasone therapy. Normal serum viscosity and absence of hyperviscosity syndrome are observed"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yom asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracure now with
   multiple myeloma.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- CXR and CT consistent with pulmonary edema,
   suspect related to volume resusitation.  Underlying asthma, OSA,
   moderate pulmonary HTN.  Continue net diuresis.  Provide oxygen,
   maintain SaO2 >90%.
   PNEUMONIA -- continue Levofloxacin & Cefepime, renally dosed, day 1 for
   CAP
   ASTHMA -- Continue Albuterol, Fluticasone, & Ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN
   OSA -- CPAP at night at 11cm H20
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- Dx confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.  Awaiting
   initiating chemotherapy.  Continue dexamethasome.
   ALTERED  MENTAL STATUS -- improved.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of
   200-300cc/hr.  Use lasix as needed.
   EPISTAXIS -- chronic history, escalation in context of
   thrombocytopenia.  If persists or escalated, consider ENT evaluation
   and packing
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- related to myeloma.  Monitor.  WOuld transfuse if
   active bleeding.
   HYPERCALCEMIA -- Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place.  PTH low, TSH normal.
   HYPERURICEMIA -- Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in
   conjunction with ARF. Received Rasburicase this PM.  Continue
   Allopurinol 100mg daily
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Cr 3.7 and continuing to rise. Renal following.
   Renal failure is likely tubular injury from cast nephropathy in
   conjunction with hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia.
   ANEMIA -- Low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin & ferritin.
   demonstrating insufficient erythropoeisis.  No evidence of TTP or
   intravascular hemolysis.  Transfuse for HCT <25.  Guaiac stools
   FLUIDS -- IVF as above, replete electrolytes.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, OSA (obstructive sleep apnea), chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, and multiple myeloma. He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and CT scan, which is suspected to be related to volume resuscitation. 

The patient has several medical conditions that require ongoing management. These include pneumonia, asthma, OSA, multiple myeloma, altered mental status, fluids, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, acute renal failure, anemia, and electrolyte imbalance. 

The patient's respiratory distress is being managed with oxygen therapy and diuretics to reduce fluid overload. Antibiotics (levofloxacin and cefepime) are being administered for pneumonia. Asthma management involves the use of albuterol, fluticasone, and ipratropium nebs every six hours as needed. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is being used at night to manage OSA. 

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Chemotherapy is pending, and dexamethasome is being continued. 

The patient's altered mental status has improved but will be monitored closely. Fluid administration is being titrated to achieve a urine output of 200-300 cc/hr. Lasix is being used"

   1. No obvious lucent lesions identified radiographically. However, the
   torso
   CT obtained the same day shows innumerable small lytic foci which are
   consistent with myeloma. Please see report of that exam. Subtle
   scalloping
   along left femoral diaphysis lateral cortex is of equivocal clinical

   Skeletal Survey:
   1. No obvious lucent lesions identified radiographically. However, the
   torso
   CT obtained the same day shows innumerable small lytic foci which are
   consistent with myeloma. Please see report of that exam. Subtle
   scalloping
   along left femoral diaphysis lateral cortex is of equivocal clinical
   significance.
   2. Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal opacities which require further
   evaluation.
   Again, please see contemporaneous CT report.
   3. Degenerative changes in the spine.
   4. Aortic calcification, unusual in someone of this age. Is there a
   history of
   diabetes or vasculopathy?
   Assessment and Plan
   47 yo M with asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracure,
   who presented with malaise & DOE found to have bony lesions on CT and a
   constellation of hematologic/electrolyte findings consistent with
   multiple myeloma.
   .
   # Dyspnea/Respiratory Distress: Patient with increasing O2 requirement
   in setting of known asthma, fluid therapy, and new right middle lobe
   pneumonia with pulmonary edema. Also with CT chest on [**4-16**] with diffuse
   ground glass opacities.  Patient also with hyperdynamic heart on TTE
   (EF 75%), elevated BNP to 4232, moderate pulmonary artery hypertension.
   Receiving Lasix [**Hospital1 **] with fluids and now on antibiotics.
   - IVFs + lasix PRN to titrate to UOP 200-300cc/hr
   - Levofloxacin & Cefepime, renally dosed, day [**3-11**]
   - O2 to maintain sats >92%  using NC
   - CPAP at night at 11cm H2O
   .
   # Multiple Myeloma: Patient with M-protein in both urine & serum
   identified as IgG kappa as well as end-organ dammage manifested as ARF
   and anemia, diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia suggests a
   diagnosis multiple myeloma. Bone marrow biopsy results are positive for
   myeloma, but patient has commenced Dexamethasone therapy as of [**4-16**].
   Normal serum viscosity and patient without signs or symptoms of
   hyperviscosity syndrome, but beta-2 microglobulin was 6.8. EBV/CMV/Toxo
   negative.
   - K/L light chain ratio pending
   - Continue Dexamethasone 40mg IV qday, day [**4-8**]
   - Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of 200-300cc/hr
   - Oncology following, will guide treatment
   .
   # Hypercalcemia: Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place. PTH low, TSH normal.
   - Goal urine output 200-300cc/hr
   - Vitamin D levels low
   .
   # Hyperuricemia: Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in
   conjunction with ARF. Received Rasburicase [**4-17**].
   - d/ced allopurinol
   - Brisk UOP as above
   - Avoid HCO3 as it will precipitate calcium & phosphate
   - Repeat tumor lysis labs q6h (rasburicase precautions; uric acid level
   must be measured in green top on ice and spun on a cooled centrifuge)
   .
   # Acute renal insufficiency: Cr 3.1, stable/downtrending from
   yesterday. Renal following. Renal failure is likely tubular injury from
   cast nephropathy in conjunction with hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia.
   - f/u renal recs
   - Continuous IVF's/Lasix to preempt further tubular injury
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: Low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin
   & ferritin demonstrating insufficient erythropoeisis.  Likely secondary
   to massive marrow infilitration from multiple myeloma.  No evidence of
   TTP, ITP, or intravascular hemolysis.
   - Maintain active T&S
   - Transfuse for HCT < 23
   - obtain transfusion goals for platelets from BMT service
   - Guaiac stools
   .
   # Epistaxis: now resolved
   - humidified O2 when possible
   - transfuse platelets prn
   .
   # Asthma: Continue Albuterol, Fluticasone, & Ipratropium nebs Q6H PRN
   .
   # FEN: IVF as above, replete electrolytes, regular

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, malaise, and dyspnea on exertion. He presented with bony lesions on CT and a constellation of hematologic/electrolyte findings consistent with multiple myeloma.

24-hour events include hct/plt transfusion, bumped appropriately, gotten type and cross. BMT recommendation includes hit, fungal markers, IgG level, UPEP, LFTs daily, DIC labs daily, TLS labs every 8 hours, discontinuing allopurinol, and starting chemotherapy treatment.

Renal recommendations include SPEP, UPEP, 24-hour urine protein, avoiding diuretics if possible, smear to look for schistosomiasis, PRN lasix, and transfusing 1 unit of PRBC.

EKG did not show anything impressive. The patient gained fluid after transfusion and was given lasix 80mg IV x1. Hepatitis panel and HIV serology were ordered.

The patient has allergies to iodine and iodine-containing substances. The last doses of antibiotics administered were azithromycin on [**2136-4-16**] at 11:30 AM, ceftriaxone on [**2136-4-17**] at 12:00 PM, levofloxacin on [**2136-4-17**] at 10:00 PM, and cefepime on [**2136-4-19**] at 12:00 AM.

Infusions include furosemide (lasix) on [**2136-4-18**] at 12:00 PM. Other medications include dexamethasone, IV fluids, and Foley catheter in place.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs include temperature (Tmax: 36.7C, Tcurrent: 36.4C), heart rate (HR: 70 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 116/65 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 19 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation (SpO2: 95%). The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 6,032 mL and total output of 7,340 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,308 mL. The patient is receiving oxygen via CPAP mask with a SpO2 of 95%. ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not performed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not performed, and other assessments as noted.

Laboratory results include white blood cell count (WBC) within normal range, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.0 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) at 23.4%, platelet count (Plt) at 59,000/mm³, creatinine (Cr) at 3.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 26 mEq/L, serum potassium (K+) at 3.1 mEq/L, serum sodium (Na+) at 136 mg/dL, chloride (Cl-) at 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 143 mEq/L, calcium (Ca++) at 9.2 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) at 2"

   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- Dx confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.  Awaiting
   initiating chemotherapy.  Continue dexamethasome.
   ALTERED  MENTAL STATUS -- improved.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of
   200-300cc/hr.  Use lasix as needed.  Restrict PO intake.
   EPISTAXIS -- chronic history, escalation in context of
   thrombocytopenia.  If persists or escalated, consider ENT evaluation
   and packing
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- related to myeloma.  Good response to plts
   transfusion.  Monitor.  Transfuse <50
   HYPERCALCEMIA -- Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place.  PTH low, TSH normal.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, and multiple myeloma. He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and CT scan, which is suspected to be related to volume resuscitation. He also has possible right lower lobe pneumonia and is being treated with levofloxacin and cefepime.

The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma and is awaiting initiation of chemotherapy. He is also experiencing altered mental status, which has improved, and is being monitored. His fluids are being managed with IVF at 150cc NS/hr, titrated to a urine output of 200-300cc/hr, and lasix as needed. He is on restricted PO intake.

The patient has a history of epistaxis, which has escalated in the context of thrombocytopenia. If it persists or worsens, he may require an ENT evaluation and packing. His thrombocytopenia is related to myeloma and responded well to platelet transfusion. It will be monitored, and transfusion is indicated if platelet count falls below 50.

The patient also has hypercalcemia, which is likely malignant and has improved since admission. He received calcitonin and pamidronate. He is receiving IVF's and has a Foley catheter in place. His PTH is low, and T"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, and multiple myeloma. The patient presented with respiratory distress, and imaging studies showed pulmonary edema, which is suspected to be related to volume resuscitation. The underlying cause of the respiratory distress includes underlying asthma, OSA, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The rib fractures are likely contributing to the limited respiratory efforts.

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, possibly in the right lower lobe (RLL), and is being treated with Levofloxacin and Cefepime, dosed based on renal function.

The patient also has a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, confirmed by bone marrow biopsy, and is awaiting initiation of chemotherapy. He is currently receiving dexamethasome.

There is an improvement in the patient's altered mental status, but it is still being monitored. The patient's fluids are being managed with intravenous fluids (IVF) at 150cc normal saline per hour, titrated to urine output of 200-300cc per hour. Lasix is being used as needed, and oral intake is restricted.

The patient has a history of epistaxis, which has escalated in the context of thrombocytopenia. If the epistaxis persists or worsens, an ENT evaluation and packing may be considered.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, and a recent rib fracture. He presented with malaise and dyspnea on exertion (DOE) and was found to have bony lesions on CT scan, along with hematologic and electrolyte findings consistent with multiple myeloma. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 122/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on CPAP. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals mild rhonchi throughout the respiratory system, and his abdomen is stable without any noticeable tenderness or masses. The patient has a Foley catheter in place for urinary output monitoring.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 8.3 to 12.7 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, platelet count between 43 and 66 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine levels decreasing from 3.6 to 2.5 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels fluctuating between 149 and 166 mg/dL.

The patient has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, as evidenced by M-protein in"

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Pulmonary Edema/RML Pneumonia: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to heart failure, as evidenced by his hyperdynamic heart on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 75%, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 4232, and moderate pulmonary artery hypertension. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids (IVFs) and lasix to optimize urine output (UOP) between 200-300cc/hr.

2. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has M-protein in both urine and serum, identified as IgG kappa, along with end-organ damage manifested as acute renal failure (ARF) and anemia. He also has diffuse lytic lesions on CT and hypercalcemia, suggesting a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient has commenced dexamethasone therapy and is scheduled for a bone marrow biopsy.

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yom asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracure now with
   multiple myeloma.  Gradual clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Prior CXR and CT consistent with pulmonary
   edema, now much improved.  Underlying asthma, OSA, moderate pulmonary
   HTN.  Rib fractures likely contributing to limiting respiratory
   efforts.  Continue net diuresis.  Provide oxygen, maintain SaO2 >90%.
   PNEUMONIA -- Possible RLL pneuomonia.  Continue Levofloxacin &
   Cefepime, renal dosing.
   ASTHMA -- Continue Albuterol, Fluticasone, & Ipratropium nebs q6H PRN
   OSA
 Nasal CPAP at night at 11cm H20.
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- Dx confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.  Awaiting
   initiating chemotherapy.  Continue dexamethasome.
   ALTERED  MENTAL STATUS -- improved.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of
   200-300cc/hr.  Use lasix as needed.  Restrict PO intake.
   EPISTAXIS -- chronic history, escalation in context of
   thrombocytopenia.  If persists or escalated, consider ENT evaluation
   and packing
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- related to myeloma.  Good response to plts
   transfusion.  Monitor.  Transfuse <50
   HYPERCALCEMIA -- Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place.  PTH low, TSH normal.
   HYPERURICEMIA -- Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in
   conjunction with ARF. Received Rasburicase this PM.  Continue
   Allopurinol 100mg daily
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Cr 3.7 and continuing to rise. Renal following.
   Renal failure is likely tubular injury from cast nephropathy in
   conjunction with hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia.
   ANEMIA -- Low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin & ferritin.
   demonstrating insufficient erythropoeisis.  No evidence of TTP or
   intravascular hemolysis.  Transfuse for HCT <25.  Guaiac stools
   FLUIDS -- IVF as above, replete electrolytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, and multiple myeloma. He presented with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU. His condition has shown gradual improvement. The patient's current assessment includes pneumonia, asthma, OSA, multiple myeloma, altered mental status, fluids management, epistaxis, thrombocytopenia, hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia, acute renal failure, anemia, and fluid repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which was consistent with pulmonary edema. Although he has improved, there is still a risk of worsening respiratory distress due to underlying asthma, OSA, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is essential.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has possible right lower lobe pneumonia. It is crucial to continue antibiotics (levofloxacin and cefepime) for pneumonia treatment and monitor for any signs of worsening or progression.

3. Asthma Exacerbation: The patient has a history of asthma, and his respiratory distress may be exacerbated by underlying asthma. It is important to continue using bronchodilators and corticosteroids as prescribed to manage asthma symptoms.

4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has a history of OSA, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   47 yom asthma, OSA, chronic low back pain, recent rib fracure now with
   multiple myeloma.  Gradual clinical improvement.
   RESPIRATORY DISTRESS -- Prior CXR and CT consistent with pulmonary
   edema, now much improved.  Underlying asthma, OSA, moderate pulmonary
   HTN.  Rib fractures likely contributing to limiting respiratory
   efforts.  Continue net diuresis.  Provide oxygen, maintain SaO2 >90%.
   PNEUMONIA -- Possible RLL pneuomonia.  Continue Levofloxacin &
   Cefepime, renal dosing.
   ASTHMA -- Continue Albuterol, Fluticasone, & Ipratropium nebs q6H PRN
   OSA
 Nasal CPAP at night at 11cm H20.
   MULTIPLE MYELOMA -- Dx confirmed by bone marrow biopsy.  Awaiting
   initiating chemotherapy.  Continue dexamethasome.
   ALTERED  MENTAL STATUS -- improved.  Monitor.
   FLUIDS -- Continue IVF's at 150cc NS/hr, titrate to UOP of
   200-300cc/hr.  Use lasix as needed.  Restrict PO intake.
   EPISTAXIS -- chronic history, escalation in context of
   thrombocytopenia.  If persists or escalated, consider ENT evaluation
   and packing
   THROMBOCYTOPENIA -- related to myeloma.  Good response to plts
   transfusion.  Monitor.  Transfuse <50
   HYPERCALCEMIA -- Likely malignant, improved since admission. Received
   Calcitonin ([**Date range (1) 12597**]) x 3 doses, Pamidronate ([**4-15**]). Receiving IVF's &
   Foley in place.  PTH low, TSH normal.
   HYPERURICEMIA -- Likely due to rate of cellular proliferation in
   conjunction with ARF. Received Rasburicase this PM.  Continue
   Allopurinol 100mg daily
   ACUTE RENAL FAILURE -- Cr 3.7 and continuing to rise. Renal following.
   Renal failure is likely tubular injury from cast nephropathy in
   conjunction with hypercalcemia, hyperuricemia.
   ANEMIA -- Low reticulocyte count, elevated haptoglobin & ferritin.
   demonstrating insufficient erythropoeisis.  No evidence of TTP or
   intravascular hemolysis.  Transfuse for HCT <25.  Guaiac stools
   FLUIDS -- IVF as above, replete electrolytes.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with a history of asthma, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), chronic low back pain, recent rib fracture, and multiple myeloma. He presented with respiratory distress and was found to have pulmonary edema, which has since improved. The patient is being treated for possible right lower lobe pneumonia with antibiotics, as well as for asthma with inhalers. He is also receiving treatment for obstructive sleep apnea with nasal CPAP at night.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and had pulmonary edema, which has improved with treatment.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may have right lower lobe pneumonia, for which he is being treated with antibiotics.
3. Asthma: The patient has a history of asthma and is being treated with inhalers.
4. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): The patient has OSA and is being treated with nasal CPAP at night.
5. Multiple Myeloma: The patient has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma and is awaiting initiation of chemotherapy.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely related to myeloma, and has received platelet transfusion.
7. Hypercalcemia: The patient had hypercalcemia, which has improved since admission. He received calcitonin and pamidronate for treatment.
