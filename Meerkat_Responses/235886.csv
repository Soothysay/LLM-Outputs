   respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**]) and s/p paracentesis complicated
   by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated to
   day in the setting of unresponsiveness
   .
   # unresponsivenes:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> plan: lactulose, lactulose, lactulose, npo to minimize ammonia for
   the bnext 24hr, pan culture, resume caspo, correct electrolyte, reckeck
   HCT, follow fever,
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, initially admitted
   from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD, s/p
   respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**]) and s/p paracentesis complicated
   by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated to
   day in the setting of unresponsiveness
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin
   - will tolerate low MAPs
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - pressors less likely to help with her presumed high cardiac output
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 new leukocytosis today, already on broad spectrum
   abx.  Unclear etiology
   - pan culture
   - IR guided diagnostic paracentesis today (will give FFP pre tap)
   - Id following
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   -back on home tegretol
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # FEN: hold TF due to protein load

   triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with only 25gm albumin. Patient is
   currently oliguric.  Renal has been following.  Has been getting
   intermittent HD.  UO has basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   Previously, patient was listed for a kidney transplant. Renal function
   is worse in the setting of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome. On [**3-24**], had
   tap to reduce pressures
   - since blood pressures unstable, renal will do CVVH.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory failure, ascites, and abdominal compartment syndrome. She was admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring dialysis. The patient has undergone multiple procedures including paracentesis, placement of dialysis catheters, and replacement of an internal jugular venous catheter. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, receiving antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), and antifungal medication due to yeast identified in urine, sputum, and skin/ascites SBP. The patient's condition includes leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, hypotension, renal failure, and a hoarse voice. She is awaiting liver and kidney transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: This condition is characterized by neurological symptoms such as confusion, altered level of consciousness, and sleep disturbances due to liver dysfunction. The patient's somnolence and minimal focal deficits may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.
2. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to her immunocompromised state, including SBP, fungal infection, and potential skin infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters, along with appropriate antibiotic and antifungal therapy, is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient's chronic"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, s/p TIPS, CKD, respiratory failure, ascites, and abdominal compartment syndrome. The patient is currently in the ICU awaiting liver and kidney transplantation.

The patient's medical complications include:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been chronically hypotensive due to liver disease with high cardiac output. She is on vasopressor support and being closely monitored with fluid administration as needed.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has worsening leukocytosis despite being on vancomycin and caspofungin. There is a yeast infection identified in urine, sputum, and skin/ascites SBP, and an abdominal eschar that could be infected. The patient had a diagnostic and therapeutic tap on 3/24, where 4L of ascites fluid was removed, and SBP diagnosis was made after correcting for RBCs. The gram stain was negative. ID follow-up is planned, including b-glucan and galactomannan tests on 3/25. The patient will continue on vancomycin, [Last Name (un)] caspofungin, and renal dosing of meds after CVVH.
3. Acute Mental Status (AMS)/Unresponsiveness: The patient is unresponsive but responds to voice. She is somnolent with no focal deficits"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - on levophed
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 worsening, on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin (since [**3-19**]).
   Yeast identified in urine, sputum and skin/ascites SBP, other etiology
   is L abdominal eschar could be infected. Patient had diagnostic and
   therapeutic tap on [**3-24**] where 4L removed. SBP diagnosis was made, after
   correcting for RBCs, however gram stain negative.
   - ID following, sent b-glucan, galactomannin on [**3-25**]
   - for skin infection, getting surgery and derm c/s [**3-25**]
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds, after CVVH will change to 500mg IV Q24H
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   -back on home tegretol
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and is awaiting liver/kidney transplant. She was admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, requiring dialysis. The patient also has a history of CKD (chronic kidney disease) and resolved respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes ascites and abdominal compartment syndrome, for which she underwent paracentesis. However, the procedure was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. She is currently hypotensive and requires norepinephrine infusion. The patient's mental status is waxing and waning, and she is inconsistently following commands.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 mmHg to 74/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.

Her lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests. Other findings include hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and hypoalbuminemia.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hemodynamics/hypotension, leukocytosis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, resolved respiratory
   failure, with ascities and abdominal compartment syndrome s/p
   paracentesis with SBP on vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin. Patient was
   initially admitted from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal
   syndrome requiring dialysis, s/p respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**])
   and s/p paracentesis complicated by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting
   liver/kidney transplant, desated to day in the setting of
   unresponsiveness.

   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin.
   - will tolerate MAPs >60
   - albumin day [**3-30**]
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - pressors less likely to help with her presumed high cardiac output

   - IR guided diagnostic paracentesis today (will give FFP pre tap)
   - Id following
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am

   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis who underwent TIPS surgery and is awaiting liver/kidney transplant. She was admitted with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome, requiring dialysis. The patient experienced respiratory failure, which necessitated extubation on [**3-11**]. She also had a paracentesis that was complicated by an intraabdominal bleed. 

The patient has been experiencing various medical complications, including chronic hypotension likely due to liver disease with high cardiac output, leukocytosis with worsening infection, acute mental status changes (AMS), hepatorenal syndrome, hypoxia, hoarse voice after self-extubation, and depression/anxiety. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), a heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55 to 111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 18 mmHg, and mixed venous O2 saturation is 74%. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, increased creatinine, high glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of delirium/confusion. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic anemia, coagulopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and impaired skin integrity. The patient is currently in the ICU for management of these conditions.

24-hour events include a paracentesis, multi-lumen placement, and blood culture. Diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis was performed, with removal of 4 liters of ascites fluid. The patient received 30g of albumin and required a small dose of neogtt. The ascites fluid showed signs of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with elevated PMNs but negative gram stain. A right internal jugular (RIJ) line was placed, and the patient remained anuric.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 76 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/55-111/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on norepinephrine infusion at 0.2 mcg/kg/min.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 18 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 7 L/min,"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has cirrhosis of the liver and is showing signs of altered mental status, such as confusion and delirium. Hepatic encephalopathy can occur due to the buildup of toxins in the blood that are normally removed by a healthy liver.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: This is a rare complication of liver disease characterized by severe kidney dysfunction. The patient's anuria (lack of urine output) suggests possible kidney involvement.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has massively distended abdomen with fluid wave and is at risk for skin breakdown and pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility.

4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate ongoing hypotension, which may be related to circulatory issues or fluid imbalances.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient's prolonged PT/INR indicates impaired blood clotting function, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.

6. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and positive paracentesis culture suggest the presence of an infection.

7. Respiratory Complications: The patient's presence of bilateral crackles at the bases of the lungs indicates possible fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory distress or failure.

8. Diabetic Ketoacidosis ("

   Assessment and Plan
   58 F with history of HCV cirrhosis s/p TIPS, CKD, initially admitted
   from OSH with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome requiring HD, s/p
   respiratory failure (extubated [**3-11**]) and s/p paracentesis complicated
   by intraabdominal bleed, awaiting liver/kidney transplant, desated to
   day in the setting of unresponsiveness
   .
   # Hemodynamics/hypotension
 likely chronically hypotensive in setting
   of liver disease with a high cardiac output.  Has art line, will
   continue to monitor.  Continue fluids with boluses as needed and
   albumin
   - will tolerate low MAPs
   - trend lactates as sign of end organ damage
   - pressors less likely to help with her presumed high cardiac output
   .
   # Leukocytosis
 new leukocytosis today, already on broad spectrum
   abx.  Unclear etiology
   - pan culture
   - IR guided diagnostic paracentesis today (will give FFP pre tap)
   - Id following
   - continue vanco, [**Last Name (un) 430**], caspofungin
 follow up with renal dosing of
   meds
   .
   # AMS/unresponsiveness:
   --> Finding: In the ICU responds to voice but clearly somnolent, no
   focal deficit, although difficult to assess
   --> data: liver failure, renal failure, CNS active meds, minimal
   electrolyte abnormalitries, infection, normal glucose
   --> differential: most likely hepatic encephalopathy, worsend by ?
   ongoing infection, electrolye, renal failure, other DD include seizure,
   IC bleed, IC infection
   --> continue lactulose, increasing dose today to 60 mg qid to see if
   she wakes up
   --> q4 neuro checks
   .
   .
   # Hepatorenal syndrome - likely triggered by 11 L Para on [**2-24**] with
   only 25gm albumin. Patient is currently oliguric.  Renal has been
   following.  Has been getting intermittent HD but was thought to be
   improving before Cr started to trend upward again yesterday.  UO has
   basically been 0 since transfer to ICU.
   - cont intermittent HD.
   - f/u renal recs
   - cont albumin, octreotide, midodrine for now
   # Hypoxia: transient in the setting of ?aspiration while unresponsive,
   CxR clear, on broag coverage already, now o2 dependence weaned, follow
   clinically and repeat cxr in am
   - f/u CXR
   - pt with good oxygen levels on NC, wean as tolerated
   .
   # Intraabdominal Bleed s/p paracentesis
 HCT stable, Vitals stable.
   - Trend HCT daily at this point
   - will need IR guided paracentesis in future
   - transfuse plt/ffp prior to procedures
   .
   # Hoarse Voice: Pt reports that voice became hoarse following
   self-extubation. Possible that she endured vocal [**Last Name (un) 8213**] trauma.
   - will ENT consult
   .
   # HCV cirrhosis - decompensated w/ varices, massive ascites s/p tips,
   encephalopathy. Awaiting transplant.
   -treat complications as above
   - liver team following, appreciate recs
   - consider discussion of code status with liver team and transplant
   team as she may no longer be a transplant candidate
   .
   # DM2
 lantus 32u daily for hyperglycemia, and HISS, decrease insulin
   when no tube feed or maintain on D5
   - holding long acting for now while NPO
   .
   # Seizure disorder -
   -back on home tegretol
   .
   # Depression/Anxiety. - holding psych meds due to delta MS.
   .
   # PPx:  pneumoboots, PPI
   .
   # FEN: hold TF due to protein load

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, who underwent TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) and is awaiting liver/kidney transplant. She was initially admitted with encephalopathy and hepatorenal syndrome and required hemodialysis. The patient experienced respiratory failure and was intubated but has since been extubated. She also had an intraabdominal bleed following a paracentesis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's condition includes leukocytosis, altered mental status (AMS), hypotension, hypoxia, hoarseness of voice, depression/anxiety, seizure disorder, and diabetes mellitus type 2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's kidney function is compromised due to liver failure.
2. Intraabdominal bleed: The patient had a bleeding episode after a paracentesis procedure.
3. Leukocytosis: There is an increase in white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection.
4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient is somnolent and unresponsive, which could be due to hepatic encephalopathy or other causes such as infection, electrolyte imbalances, or renal failure.
5. Hypotension: The patient is likely chronically hypotensive, possibly related to liver disease with high cardiac output.
