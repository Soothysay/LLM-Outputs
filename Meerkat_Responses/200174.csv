   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient with poor baseline
   respiratory status presumably related to pulmonary hypertension, heart
   failure, chronic PE, ?any underlying obstructive disease.  Pulmonary
   following on the floor.  Had reached stable point with worsening O2
   requirements over past 8-12 hours.  New fever at same time.  Likely
   some tachypnea a result of fever.  Also concern for pneumonia (HAP)
   given increasing and change in sputum and cough, fever, slight
   worsening of WBC count.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be volume overloaded with poor
   response to most recent 80 mg IV lasix dose and longstanding volume
   overload, despite meeting I/O goals on floor. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Start diuresis with lasix gtt.  Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Check BNP for comparisons to priors.
   - likely with replace Aline for hemodynamic monitoring on gtt plus
   access to frequent ABGs given tenuous respiratory status.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Vanc, Zosyn Cipro
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   - Check abd US given surgery; unable to do CT abd currently given
   respiratory status/inability to lie flat, but would consider this in
   future.
   - restart vanc for GPC coverage, start double gram negative with cipro
   and ?zosyn vs. meropenem.
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil and anticoag for now.  Consideration for increase
   in sildenafil vs. endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - RHC in the future.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Continue therapeutic lovenox.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE.  Chronically anticoagulated.  Was also on plavix at some
   point with report of ?breakthrough clot on coumadin.  Reports
   hemoptysis on plavix.  Now on ASA plus lovenox. However with worsening
   renal function would consider hold
   - Continuing lovenox, holding coumadin as above.  Ideal anticoagulant
   for long term - lovenox or coumadin given ?coumadin failure.  Consider
   check factor X levels to ensure lovenox thereapeutic, though not
   morbidly obese and with normal renal function so would guess levels as
   expected.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Daily dressing changes.
   - wound care
   - pain control.
   - abdominal US to check for collections; consider CT abdomen.
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO until respiratory status
   improves, then regular DM/low Na

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia and later readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has poor baseline respiratory status, possibly related to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE, and potential underlying obstructive disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (Healthcare-associated Pneumonia/HAP) - The patient presents with fever, worsening cough, and an increased white blood cell count. There is also a concern for pneumonia given the recent antibiotic treatment for HAP, change in sputum, and cough.
2. Fluid overload - The patient has been on diuretic therapy with Lasix but still shows signs of volume overload. This may be contributing to respiratory distress.
3. Infection - The presence of fever and abdominal fluid collections on ultrasound suggests a possible infection, which cannot be excluded.
4. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) - The patient's history of PE and worsening pulmonary hypertension after PFO closure raises the possibility of CTEPH.
5. Diastolic heart failure - The patient's history of diastolic congestive heart failure may contribute to his respiratory distress.
6. Patent foramen"

   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient improved today. On 6L nasal
   cannula. Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably
   related to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology
   unclear which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible
   given fever, recent cessation in antibiotics, however no white count,
   has not continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor
   response to 80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP
   elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix gtt.  Goal -500cc. Diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis.
   - Supratherapeutic INR currently. Hold Lovenox given worsening renal
   function. Monitor INR.
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
   - Consideration for RHC/further PA HTN management as below.
   .
   # Fever. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and zosyn for
   HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.  Abd
   Ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections, infection can not
   be excluded. C. Diff Negative.  Influenza DFA negative.
   - Surgery consult re: Abdominal Fluid Collection.
   - Vanc, Zosyn
 hold Cipro given elevated INR and QT prolongation.
   - Vanc trough tomorrow dose per level
   - Blood cultures; low threshold to dc PICC.
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce.
   - Recheck C.diff if diarrhea.
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing.
   - Repeat EKG this AM
   - Hold Ciprofloxacin
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload).
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   supratherapeutic this AM.
   - Continue sildenafil. Supratherapeutic INR. Holding other
   anticoagulation for now. Consideration for increase in sildenafil vs.
   endothelin antagonist pending RHC.
   - Given worsening Renal Function may need to transition to heparin with
   bridge to coumadin.
   - O2 support as above.
   - Swan Catheter for eval of right heart function.
   .
   # Atrial flutter.  s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Last course
   in MICU again had aflutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased.
   Currently anticoagulated.
   - Hold lovenox currently supratherapeutic INR.
   - Hold coumadin for now in case of need for any additional procedures
   (RHC).
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR.
   - Restart Coumadin sp RHC.
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor.
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Daily dressing changes.
   - wound care
   - pain control.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia and readmitted to the MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty in breathing, which may be due to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE, or pneumonia.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has low levels of oxygen in his blood, which could be related to his respiratory distress and underlying pulmonary issues.

3. Poor response to diuretic Lasix: The patient did not improve with the administration of IV Lasix on the floor, indicating possible fluid overload or other causes for his symptoms.

4. New PE: There is a possibility of a new pulmonary embolism, considering the patient's history and current symptoms.

5. Abdominal fluid collections: An abdominal ultrasound revealed fluid collections around the surgical incision site, which may indicate an infection or chronic nature. 

6. Chronic PE: The patient has a history of chronic PE, and further management is required for this condition.

7. Atrial flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which has been cardioverted in the past. He is currently anticoagulated but requires monitoring of his IN"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, a history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure, and percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). He was initially admitted to the operating room for a strangulated hernia and then readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory distress, hypoxia, pneumonia, fluid overload, and potential new PE. He also has an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing, which may be due to his underlying severe pulmonary hypertension, recent surgery, or a new PE.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation level is below normal, indicating inadequate oxygen supply to his tissues. This could be related to his respiratory distress or underlying lung condition.
3. Pneumonia: Despite treatment with antibiotics, the patient still has a fever, and there is a possibility of pneumonia. Further investigations such as sputum culture may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance indicates a positive balance, suggesting fluid overload. This can lead to complications such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
5. New Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's"

   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis

   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure, and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia and then readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current condition is improving despite an episode of desaturation overnight. He has poor baseline respiratory status likely related to pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and chronic PE. The etiology of his decompensation is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia, fluid overload, or a new PE.

Treatment plans include:
- Treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Lasix 20mg and reassessment of urine output.
- Consider diamox for metabolic alkalosis.
- Continue high oxygen support to minimize hypoxic vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension.
- Discuss right heart catheterization (RHC) further on rounds tomorrow.

Additional assessments and plans include:
- Fever: The patient is currently afebrile after an 8-day course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for HAP. No symptoms of aspiration or positive urinalysis. Abdominal ultrasound shows complex paramedian fluid collections, but surgery does not believe these are infected. C. Diff negative and influenza DFA negative.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Surgery felt that the wound was superficial on US. Not in the
   abdomen. Therefore, no need for CT (after he drank the contrast).
   - Surgery swung by in AM; if the collections were infected, there would
   be purulent discharge and he would be sick/the wound would look worse
   with dehiscence, etc; seromas are normal and there is nothing to do.
   - Desaturated to 83% while sleeping last night. Was fine when woken.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. The patient initially presented with a strangulated hernia and was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient's current assessment includes respiratory distress, hypoxia, poor baseline respiratory status, potential pneumonia, fluid overload, and new PE. The B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated. Treatment plans include administration of high-flow oxygen, consideration for right heart catheterization (RHC), and management of pulmonary hypertension.

Additionally, the patient has a fever without an identified source, negative influenza DFA, and C. difficile negative. The fever is being treated with continuation of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Blood cultures are pending, and a sputum culture may be induced if needed.

The patient also has acute renal failure (ARF) with worsening creatinine over the past two days, possibly related to increased lasix infusion and reduced fluid volume. Discontinuation of lasix gtt and initiation of lasix IV bid 40mg are considered to achieve a goal of -500mL to -1L fluid removal.

Other medical conditions include atrial flutter"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of pulmonary hypertension, previous repair of patent foramen ovale (PFO), multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The patient was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, ongoing hypoxemia, and respiratory distress. 

The patient has been on high flow oxygen and diuresis, which has resulted in an improvement in oxygenation. However, the patient still requires ongoing respiratory support. The plan is to continue with high flow mask therapy and monitor the response. 

The patient also has chronic PEs, for which heparin therapy will be restarted when the INR is below 2. 

Additionally, the patient has been experiencing fevers, and the antibiotic regimen will be continued for an 8-day course. 

The patient is currently being managed for atrial flutter, and the dose of sotalol will be adjusted accordingly. 

Other issues mentioned in the note include prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's overall condition is critical, and he remains in the ICU."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia but was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, fluid overload, potential new PE, and acute renal failure (ARF).

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient's poor baseline respiratory status, combined with pneumonia and potential new PE, increases the risk of further respiratory distress.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate inadequate oxygen supply to tissues and organs.
3. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance is negative, indicating potential fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory distress.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's worsening creatinine levels suggest ARF, which may be related to increased lasix gtt and reduced volume.
5. Chronic PE: The patient's history of PE and supratherapeutic INR suggest chronic thromboembolic disease, which can cause pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular strain.
6. Prolonged QT interval: The patient's prolonged QT interval may increase the risk of arrhythmias, particularly in the setting of recent medication changes.
7. Thrombocytosis: The patient's elevated platelet count may increase the risk of thrombotic events.
8. Surgical site infection: The patient has complex paramedian fluid collections post-strangulated hernia repair, but surgery has determined that these are unlikely to be infectious in nature.
9. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: Although the patient's C. diff test is negative, it should be monitored due to recent antibiotic use.
10. Influenza infection: The patient's influenza DFA test is negative, ruling out this cause of respiratory distress.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episode of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Sputum culture; consider induction given concern for recurrence if
   can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Worsening creatinine over past 2 days likely related with
   increased lasix gtt and possible component preload secondary to reduced
   volume.
   - Discontinue lasix gtt
   - Lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - Discuss RHC further on rounds tomorrow, [**1-22**]
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   - Obtain EKG tomorrow AM
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start heparin when INR < 2; hold on coumadin at this time pending
   RHC/procedures
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.

","The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He initially presented with a strangulated hernia and was admitted to the operating room for surgery. Subsequently, he was readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.

The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities, including chronic PE, diastolic CHF, severe pulmonary hypertension, atrial flutter, prolonged QT interval, thrombocytosis, type II diabetes mellitus (DM), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and a recent history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient's current medications include sildenafil, pantoprazole (Protonix), furosemide (Lasix), heparin, and vancomycin. His laboratory results show an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating possible heart failure exacerbation. The patient's vital signs reveal hypotension, bradycardia, and an increased respiratory rate.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, pneumonia, fluid overload, new PE, and metabolic alkalosis. Additionally, the patient has a history of atrial flutter, prolonged QT interval, and thrombocytosis, which may require further evaluation"

 In comparison with the study of [**1-20**], there are areas of
   increased opacification at both bases. Although some of this could
   represent atelectasis, the possibility of bilateral pneumonia must be
   seriously considered. The costophrenic angles remain somewhat blunted.
   PICC line extends to at least the cavoatrial junction and possibly into
   the right atrium itself.
   Assessment and Plan
   41M with severe pulmonary hypertension, history of PE, diastolic CHF,
   and PFO closure, initially admitted to OSH for strangulated hernia, now
   readmitted to MICU for fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
   .
   # Respiratory distress, hypoxia.  Patient continuing to improve despite
   episodes of desaturation overnight (has had such episodes before).
   Patient with poor baseline respiratory status presumably related to
   pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, chronic PE. Etiology unclear
   which led to decompensation on the floor. Pneumonia possible given
   fever, recent cessation of antibiotics, however no white count, has not
   continued to spike. Fluid overload also possible given poor response to
   80mg IV lasix on the floor. New PE also a possibility. BNP elevated.
   - Treatment for HAP as below.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   - Consider diamox prn for metabolic alkalosis
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   .
   # Fever. Afebrile. s/p recent 8 day course (finished [**1-16**]) of vanc and
   zosyn for HAP.  Denies symptoms of aspiration. Urinalysis negative.
   Abdominal ultrasound with complex paramedian fluid collections; surgery
   has seen patient and notes unlikely infection. C. Diff negative.
   Influenza DFA negative.
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   - Continue vanc/zosyn for a total of eight days
   - Follow vancomycin trough
   - Follow blood cultures; low threshold to d/c PICC
   - Follow sputum culture; consider induction given concern for
   recurrence if can't produce
   - Recheck C. Diff if diarrhea
   .
   # ARF. Stable to mild improvement. Likely initially related with lasix
   gtt, possible preload component [**2-4**] volume.
   - Continue lasix 20mg [**Hospital1 **] and re-assess UOP
   .
   # Pulmonary hypertension.  Had elevated mPAPs with PFO closure 6 months
   ago, now likely worse since PFO closure.  Differential includes chronic
   thromboembolic (but no large clot seen on CTA), L to R shunting from
   PFO, idiopathic PAH, diastolic heart failure/L atrial overload.
   Currently with class IV symptoms.  On sildenafil (started at OSH). INR
   therapeutic at this time. Will not do swan cath at this time.
   - Continue sildenafil
   - No right heart catheterization at this time
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   - Continue high O2 support to minimize hypoxic
   vasoconstriction/pulmonary hypertension
   .
   # Atrial flutter. s/p cardioversion at outside hospital.  Had episode
   of repeat atrial flutter with RVR when sotalol was decreased. Currently
   anticoagulated.
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Anemia. Hct slightly decreasing. Uncertain anemia chronic disease
   versus other etiologies.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Prolonged QT: Most likely secondary to Ciprofloxacin which was
   recently started. Sotalol also may be contributing. QT 438 on [**1-20**] EKG.
   - Continue to follow
   .
   # Chronic PE: Supratherapeutic INR. Will hold lovenox given worsening
   renal function. Will allow INR to fall with hopes for RHC in near
   future.
   - Monitor INR
   - Start coumadin 2mg
   .
   # Thrombocytosis.  Likely related to acute infection plus post op.
   Stable to improving.
   - Continue to monitor
   .
   # s/p strangulated hernia repair.  No significant change in pain.
   Having bowel movements.
   - Continue daily dressing changes, wound care
   - Continue pain control prn
   - Appreciate surgery recommendations
   .
   # Type II DM.
   - Continue sliding scale.
   .
   # GERD.
   - Continue PPI.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a history of severe pulmonary hypertension, previous pulmonary embolism (PE), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. He was initially admitted for a strangulated hernia and readmitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to fever, hypoxia, and respiratory distress. The patient's baseline respiratory status is poor, and he has episodes of desaturation. Possible etiologies for his decompensation include pneumonia, fluid overload, new PE, or a combination of these factors. The patient is receiving treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including antibiotics, lasix, and high oxygen support. His recent lab results show an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level, indicating heart failure exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress, which can be attributed to his poor baseline respiratory status, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and potential pneumonia.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia, likely due to the respiratory distress and underlying pulmonary issues.
3. Pneumonia: Given the patient's fever and recent cessation of antibiotics, pneumonia is a possible complication.
4. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid overload could contribute to his respiratory distress and may require further management.

","Summary:
The patient is a 41-year-old male with a past medical history of hernia, coagulopathy, peripheral edema, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and acute respiratory failure. He has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to various complications. The patient is currently experiencing pulmonary hypertension, acute respiratory distress, and atrial flutter. He is being treated with Lasix, sildenafil, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/68 mmHg to 128/86 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98%, and temperature within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure and is currently experiencing ongoing hypoxemia and respiratory distress. This condition requires careful monitoring and management to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Chronic Pulmonary Embolisms (PEs): The patient has a known history of multiple deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and presumed chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The presence of subsegmental thrombi seen on computed tomography angiography (CTA) confirms the diagnosis of CTEPH. Anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin is necessary to prevent further clot formation and progression of the disease.
