 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis from likely RUQ
   source, now improving.
   1. Sepsis: at OSH, hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and an additional
   GNR growing from blood cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and
   negative CXR for pneumonia. Source is likely biliary, concern for liver
   abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**] from OSH.  She also had elevated TB/AP
   at OSH admission that trended to normal. Repeat CT abdomen to evaluate
   for interval change. OSH studies on CD/available for comparison.  No
   new data from OSH micro lab as of [**2169-1-5**] pm.  Will cover with Linezolid
   (given history of VRE bacteremia), gentamicin and Meropenem until
   sensitivities from OSH available.  Check gentamicin trough in am (last
   dose 6 am [**1-5**])  and continue previous dosing at 120 mg daily once level
   back.  Send blood cultures here and plan for surveillance cultures for
   next several days.   Plan also for ERCP for stent evaluation in am.
   Currently afebrile, HD stable.
   2. Atrial fibrillation:  PAF, currently in sinus with PACs. Continue
   digoxin for now as would prefer not to use medications which can affect
   BP in the peri-septic period.  Dilt IV as needed, optimize
   electrolytes.  CHADS score is 4, patient would warrant AC, but would
   not start until after ERCP completed.  Had been ordered for propafenone
   at OSH, but per [**Month (only) **], did not receive. Will not start.  Check digoxin
   level
   3. Thrombocytopenia: no evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission
   Plt count 243 and now 120 (OSH value was 93). A component of dilution
   expected, but ? related to critical illness vs. medication. TCP not
   associated with gentamicin or imipenem. She was receiving Lovenox and
   Vancomycin.
   4. NSTEMI:  positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH
   (though clinical setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**]
   LE edema and is on chronic Lasix at home (check LENIs in am). Lasix
   currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrate a change
   in axis and co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in
   one of the consultant notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and
   maintenance of new axis since [**1-2**]--cycle enzymes.  Check
   echocardiogram. Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or
   beta blocker at home given history of CAD/CHF.  Recheck ECG in am.
   5. Parkinson's disease: continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient
   doses.
   6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2: SSI for now.
   7. Hyperlipidemia: continue Zocor
   8. Allergies: continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   9. Acute renal failure: creatinine of 1.4 at OSH admission, now
   normalizing. Pre-renal etiology, now resolved
   10. Anemia: mild, lower values at OSH.  Will trend

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted with sepsis from a likely right upper quadrant (RUQ) source, which is improving. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation (AFib), leukocytosis, and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's condition can worsen if the infection spreads or if there is resistance to the current antibiotics being used.
2. Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient may experience further cardiac complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias if the myocardial injury progresses.
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient may develop more severe arrhythmias or clot formation in the heart, leading to potential stroke risk if not properly managed.
4. Leukocytosis: The high white blood cell count indicates an ongoing inflammatory response, and if not addressed, could lead to further complications related to the underlying infection.
5. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status can deteriorate if the sepsis worsens or if there are complications from other medical conditions.
6. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count may indicate a risk for bleeding complications if not"

   Assessment and Plan
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis from likely RUQ
   source, now improving.
   1. Sepsis:
   At OSH, hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial bacteremia.
   Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and an additional GNR growing
   from blood cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and negative CXR for
   pneumonia. Source is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT
   scan from [**2169-1-3**] from OSH.  She also had elevated TB/AP at OSH
   admission that trended to normal. OSH studies on CD/available for
   comparison.
   - ERCP for evaluation of stents
   - CT abdomen to furthur investigate intra-abdominal processes,
   specifically potential of liver absecess vs. mets
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose (most recent gent dose prior to admission was
   at 0600 on [**2169-1-5**].
   - Await final speciations and senstivities of OSH blood cultures
   - Follow-up speciation of blood cultures from admission
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   2. Atrial fibrillation:
   Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently in sinus with PACs. Digoxin
   level returned yesterday as 3.5. Dilt IV as needed, optimize
   electrolytes.  CHADS score is 4, patient would warrant anticoagulation,
   though this issue is complicated by history of recent falls. In any
   case, would not start until after ERCP completed. Had been ordered for
   propafenone at OSH, but per [**Month (only) **], did not receive. Will not start.
   - Will hold for today and then continue start digoxin again tomorrow
   with lower weekly dose.
   3. Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   104 (OSH value was 93). A component of dilution expected, but ? related
   to critical illness vs. medication. Thrombocytopenia not associated
   with gentamicin or imipenem. She was receiving Lovenox and Vancomycin.
   4. NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home (check LENIs in am). Lasix currently on hold.
   ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to [**2169-1-3**] demonstrate a change in axis and
   co-incides with chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the
   consultant notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new
   axis since [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins. Continue
   aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker at home
   given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   - Follow-up ECHO
   5. Lower Extremity Edema:
   Right greater than left with no associated pain.
   - Lower extremity dopplers to evaluate for DVTs.
   5. Parkinson's disease:
   Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   6. Diabetes mellitus, type 2:
   SSI for now
   7. Hyperlipidemia:
   Continue Zocor
   8. Allergies:
   Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition:
   NPO in anticipation of ERCP this AM, then will be cardiac,
   heart-healthy diet.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old female with a history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial bacteremia from cholangitis, presenting with sepsis from a likely right upper quadrant (RUQ) source. The patient has been improving and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), atrial fibrillation, leukocytosis, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and lower extremity edema.

The patient's chief complaint is sepsis. The 24-hour events include planned antibiotics (linezolid, gentamicin, meropenem) with gentamicin dosed based on trough levels. The patient has low urine output throughout the night and this morning, despite increasing fluid rate to 125 mL/hr. Blood culture from yesterday showed growth of 1-5 GPC in pairs and chains.

The patient reports no pain or dyspnea but does report that her bum is sore. She has allergies to penicillins, specifically experiencing rash. The last dose of antibiotics was meropenem at 04:02 AM on [date]. The patient is receiving other ICU medications and medications for various conditions including Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, and asthma.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.
   This am she denies pain, SOB, or other complaints.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size. 2. Vague region of parenchymal
   enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts could represent obstructive
   tumor mass, but its margins are difficult to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5-2 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - As the liver abscesses are not amenable to drainage, she will need a
   prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.  Givent the concern for
   a mass at the porta hepatis and the patient
s known history of
   cholangiocarcinoma, she may need to undergo further imaging for this
   mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg every
   other day (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Hypertension: The patient
s SBPs have been trending upwards.  She
   usually is on lasix 40 mg daily at home.
   - Can restart her home lasix.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.  Will need to have discussion with family
   about goals of care to determine whether she should continue to be
   anticoagulated for the DVT vs IVC filter vs no treatment given her risk
   of bleeding due to her history of falls.
   - Restart home lasix as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   104 (OSH value was 93).  Stable
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.  Will hold off starting either in the
   acute setting of resolving bacteremia.
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple abscesses in the liver
   adjacent to where the stents are placed in the anterior portion of the
   left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm; additionally there are a
   couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is intrahepatic ductal
   dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also suspects a mass centrally
   at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal dilation is present (but no
   mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of the collections would be
   amenable to drainage.
   - The patient went for ERCP and had both sides of her stents flushed
   without complication.
   - Culture data was faxed from the OSH and showed:
      - enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin
      - E.coli sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins
      - Klebsiella pansensitive except to amp
   - The lower extrem dopplers showed a DVT in her left leg (even though
   the right leg looks more swollen).  After her ERCP she was started on a
   heparin gtt for a goal PTT of 50-70.
   - Her TTE showed an EF of >55%, but elevated PCWP.
   - Her BCx from [**1-5**] were [**4-8**] gram + cocci in pairs and chains
   - There was concern that the patient aspirated her pm meds so her meds
   were changed to IV and speech and swallow c/s was requested.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size.
   2. Vague region of parenchymal enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts
   could represent obstructive tumor mass, but its margins are difficult
   to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

   CT abd/pelvis [**1-6**]:
   CT abd/pelvis [**12-7**] -
   1. Intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with peri-biliary enhancement
   consistent with cholangitis. Anteriorly in the left lobe, multiple
   hypodense collections with enhancing rims, consistent with multiple
   abscesses. The largest measures approximately 2 cm and may be amenable
   to percutaneous sampling if desired, but is not likely amenable to
   catheter drainage at its present size. 2. Vague region of parenchymal
   enhancement at the apex of dilated ducts could represent obstructive
   tumor mass, but its margins are difficult to define.
   3. Interval increase in small bilateral pleural effusions, small
   pericardial effusion, and small amount of ascites.
   4. Interval increase in size of enhancing pericardial lymph node.
   5. Evidence of thrombosis of the posterior right portal vein, resulting
   in heterogeneous perfusion of the posterior right lobe of the liver.
   6. 9-mm pancreatic hypodensity, not previously visualized. While it is
   too small to characterize, findings suggest a cystic lesion such as a
   dilated side branch or an isolated cystic lesion. If desired, this can
   be further evaluated with MRCP.
   Assessment and Plan
   83 year old female with history of biliary obstruction, polymicrobial
   bacteremia from cholangitis presenting with sepsis, now improving s/p
   ERCP, also with a lower extremity DVT now on heparin.
   # Sepsis/leukocytosis/Cholangitis:
   At the OSH she was hypotensive with leukocytosis and polymicrobial
   bacteremia. Currently with E. coli, Klebsiella, GPC and VRE from blood
   cultures. Has negative UA/Urine culture and CXR for pneumonia. Source
   is likely biliary, concern for liver abscess on CT scan from [**2169-1-3**]
   from OSH.  She was started on meropenem, linezolid, and gent for her
   polymicrobial bacteremia.  Inital blood cultures here have grown out
   [**4-8**] GPC in pairs and chains.  Culture data was faxed from the OSH and
   showed: 1) enterococcus sensitive to gent and streptomycin, 2) E.coli
   sensitive to gent, imipenem, and cephalosporins, and 3) Klebsiella
   pansensitive except to amp.  The repeat CT abd/pelvis showed multiple
   abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed in the
   anterior portion of the left lobe.  The largest collection is 1.5 cm;
   additionally there are a couple of subcm foci.  Also seen is
   intrahepatic ductal dilation/cholangitis.  The radiologist also
   suspects a mass centrally at the porta hepatis as intrahepatic ductal
   dilation is present (but no mass is visualized).  Per radiology none of
   the collections would be amenable to drainage.  She underwent ERCP on
   [**1-6**] and had both sides of her stents flushed without complication.
   - Continue Linezolid, Meropenem, Gentamicin with gent dosed Q48H with a
   trough prior to each dose.  The OSH sensitivity data showed that some
   of the organisms were resistent, however this combination of
   antibiotics adequately covers them all.
   - F/U pending Bcx
   - Wean antibiotics as indicated by culture data
   - Surveillance blood cultures
   - As the liver abscesses are not amenable to drainage, she will need a
   prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.  Givent the concern for
   a mass at the porta hepatis and the patient
s known history of
   cholangiocarcinoma, she may need to undergo further imaging for this
   mass.
   # Atrial fibrillation:
   The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, currently
   in sinus with PACs. Digoxin level returned two days again at 3.5 and
   her dig was held ysterday.
   - Will restart digoxin again today with a lower dose of 0.0625 mg daily
   (she was on 0.125 mg daily).
   - As the patient has many complicating medical issues and has a history
   of falls, even with her CHADS score of 4, she would not be a great
   candidate for anticoagulation.
   # Hypertension: The patient
s SBPs have been trending upwards.  She
   usually is on lasix 40 mg daily at home.
   - Can restart her home lasix.
   # Lower Extremity Edema/ Left leg DVT:
   Right greater than left edema with no associated pain.  Lower extremity
   doppler showed a left-sided DVT.  The patient was started on a heparin
   gtt overnight.
   - Continue anticoagulation with the heparin drip for treatment of her
   DVT with a goal of 50-70.
   - Restart home lasix as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia:
   No evidence of splenomegaly on CT scan. Admission Plt count 243 and now
   *** (OSH value was 93).  Part of her platelet drop was likely from
   dilution.
   # Possible NSTEMI:
   Positive troponin, ECG changes and elevated BNP at OSH (though clinical
   setting in which this was ordered is unclear).   [**Name2 (NI) 6**] LE edema and is on
   chronic Lasix at home. Lasix currently on hold.  ECG from [**2169-1-2**] to
   [**2169-1-3**] demonstrates a change in axis and co-incides with
   chills/rigors/shortness of breath noted in one of the consultant
   notes.  ECG here with new TWI V1-V4 and maintenance of new axis since
   [**1-2**]. Patient is ruled out for MI by troponins.  Her TTE yesterday
   showed a normal EF >55%, however increased PCWP indicating diastolic
   heart failure.
   - Continue aspirin and statin.  Unclear why not on ace or beta blocker
   at home given history of CAD/CHF.
   - Follow-up AM EKG
   # Parkinson's disease:
   - Continue Sinemet and Pramipexole at outpatient doses.
   # Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Well controlled, not requiring coverage,
   although she has been NPO.
   - qid fingersticks and SSI coverage.
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - Continue Zocor
   # Allergies:
   - Continue outpatient Singulair, albuterol nebs prn
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now until speech and swallow evaluates her given
   aspiration concerns.

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that could arise for this patient:

1. Liver abscesses: The patient has multiple abscesses in the liver adjacent to where the stents are placed. These abscesses are not amenable to drainage, and the patient will require a prolonged course of antibiotics for treatment.

2. Cholangitis: The patient has intrahepatic ductal dilation and cholangitis, which may indicate an obstruction in the bile ducts. This could be due to a mass at the porta hepatis, as suspected by the radiologist. Further imaging may be needed to evaluate this concern.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a DVT in her left leg, and her right leg appears more swollen. She is currently on a heparin drip for treatment of her DVT.

4. Hypertension: The patient's SBPs have been trending upwards, and she usually takes Lasix 40 mg daily at home. It is recommended to restart her home Lasix.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She was in sinus rhythm with PACs, and her digoxin level was previously elevated. She will be restarted on digoxin at a lower dose.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 243 to 93 (OSH value). This may"

   Assessment and Plan
   BACTEREMIA -- polymicrobial, high grade, in context of new liver
   lesions (presumed abscesses).
   LIVER LESIONS -- likely represent abscesses, but may also represent
   tumor.  Continue antimicrobials.  Monitor lesions with f/u study in
   future.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP and flushing of metal stents.  Tolerated well.
   Continue antimicrials
   DVT -- lift LE.  Heparin with goal PTT 60-80.  Monitor LE girth.  Need
   to determine long-term goals as patient may not be good candidate for
   chronic anticoagulation --> IVC filter may be option if no plans for
   coumadin.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- confusion attibuted to sepsis.  Now improved.
   CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA -- palliative care.
   PORTA HEPATIS MASS -- suggests new mass, perhaps progression of known
   cholangiocarcinoma.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- hold, and resume Digoxin dosing when level declines
   to therapeutic range.
   PARKINSON's DISEASE -- continue usual meds.  Neurology to assist in
   medication management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending swallow evaluation.  Likely
   attributed to Parkinson's.
   FLUIDS -- replete.  Monitor I/O.  Maintain balance.

   Assessment and Plan
   BACTEREMIA -- polymicrobial, high grade, in context of new liver
   lesions (presumed abscesses).
   LIVER LESIONS -- likely represent abscesses, but may also represent
   tumor.
   CHOLANGITIS -- s/p ERCP and flushing of metal stents.
   DVT -- lift LE.  Heparin with goal PTT 60-80.  Monitor LE girth.  Need
   to determine long-term goals as patient may not be good candidate for
   chronic anticoagulation --> IVC filter may be option if no plans for
   coumadin.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- confusion attibuted to sepsis.
   CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA -- palliative care.
   PORTA HEPATIS MASS -- suggests new mass, perhaps progression of known
   cholangiocarcinoma.
   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- hold, and resume Digoxin dosing when level declines
   to therapeutic range.
   PARKINSON's DISEASE -- continue usual meds.  Neurology to assist in
   medication management.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO pending swallow evaluation.  Likely
   attributed to Parkinson's.
   FLUIDS -- replete.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill with sepsis and multiple medical complications. They have a history of cholangiocarcinoma and recent liver lesions, which may represent abscesses or tumor progression. The patient also has developed cholangitis after an ERCP procedure. Additionally, they have deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left lower extremity and altered mental status attributed to sepsis. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their various medical issues, including glycemic control, nutritional support, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, indicating a do-not-resuscitate/do-not-intubate preference. The patient remains in the ICU for ongoing care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing sepsis, which can lead to organ failure if not promptly and effectively treated.
2. Cholangitis: The patient has developed cholangitis following an ERCP procedure. This condition requires immediate attention and may require additional interventions such as biliary drainage.
3. DVT/Leg Ischemia: The patient has a confirmed DVT in the left lower extremity. If left untreated or worsens, it can lead to pulmonary embolism or leg ischemia.
4. Liver Abscesses/Tumor Progression: The liver lesions need further evaluation to determine if they are abscesses or tumor progression. If they are abs"
