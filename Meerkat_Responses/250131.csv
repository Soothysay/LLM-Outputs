","Summary:
The patient is a [age] year-old female with a history of worsening dyspnea for 2-3 weeks. She was found to have heart failure, possibly secondary to atrial fibrillation. The patient also has volume overload and crackles on examination. She has no evidence of pneumonia or previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is concern about a silent myocardial infarction causing heart failure, but troponin levels are not elevated. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, although it is not recorded in the medical record. In the emergency department, she entered atrial fibrillation with a heart rate in the high 90s to low 100s. The patient's CHADS 2 score is 2, indicating a moderate risk of stroke. The decision regarding anticoagulation will be discussed with the patient's primary care physician. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and she will be dispositioned to the floors today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with heart failure, such as dyspnea and volume overload. It is important to monitor her intake/output status, daily weights, and administer diuretics as needed to manage fluid balance and prevent worsening of symptoms.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of worsening dyspnea for 2-3 weeks. She was diagnosed with acute heart failure, possibly secondary to atrial fibrillation. The patient also has anemia and right lower extremity edema. Her current medications include metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and aspirin. She is currently being treated with diuretics, monitoring of intake/output and daily weights, cardiac diet, and repletion of electrolytes. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and edema suggest acute heart failure. This condition can worsen if not properly managed with appropriate medications and lifestyle changes.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. It is important to monitor her heart rate and consider rate control measures such as metoprolol.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. Regular monitoring and further evaluation of the cause of anemia is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment.

4. Respiratory Infections: The chest X-ray shows evidence of mild interstitial pulmonary edema, small right pleural effusion, and linear opacities suggestive of atelectasis. These findings may indicate a risk of respiratory infections such as pneumonia"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old female with a history of worsening dyspnea for 2-3 weeks. She has been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute heart failure (CHF), possibly secondary to atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient is experiencing volume overload and shows signs of edema in her lower extremities. There is no evidence of pneumonia and no previous history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit level of 30%, which is close to her recent baseline, and a history of iron deficiency anemia. She is currently on diuretics, specifically Lasix, to manage fluid overload. Other medications include metoprolol for rate control in AFib and aspirin for cardiovascular protection. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and volume overload indicate acute heart failure. The patient's heart function needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to manage fluid balance and prevent further deterioration of heart function.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potentially worsen heart failure. Rate control and anticoagulation therapy may be required to manage this condition.

3. Anemia: The patient's low"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), presenting with worsening dyspnea over the past 2-3 weeks. She has been admitted to the ICU for further management. Her current vital signs include a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 159/132 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 86% on nasal cannula, and temperature of 36.4°C. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation with irregular rhythm. Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and troponin T levels. The patient is currently receiving metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), and other medications as per the ICU resident's note. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and crackles at the bases of the lungs indicate ongoing fluid accumulation in the lungs. If not properly managed, this can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function and respiratory distress.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient is currently experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent these complications.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests the possibility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **] year-old female with a history of worsening dyspnea for 2-3 weeks. She was found to have heart failure (systolic and diastolic), anxiety, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has a volume overload on examination and no evidence of pneumonia or previous history of COPD. A new diagnosis of congestive heart failure (CHF) is made, and there are concerns about a silent myocardial infarction causing CHF, although troponin levels are not elevated. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) is 30%. She has been receiving IV Lasix and has produced 1.4 liters of urine after the first dose. Foley catheter was removed. The patient also has mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. She is currently on aspirin, atrovent nebs q6h, and metoprolol TID. The patient's CHADS2 score is 2, indicating a moderate risk for anticoagulation. Atrial fibrillation has been present throughout the night with heart rates in the high 90s to low 100s. The patient's goals of care do not include cardioversion. The patient's Hct is 30%, close to recent baseline, and previous labs show iron deficiency anemia. The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]y female with a history of worsening dyspnea for 2-3 weeks. She has been diagnosed with heart failure (systolic and diastolic), acute anxiety, and atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient has a moderate to severe global left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction (LVEF) of 30%. There is also mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's blood pressure is fluctuating, and she has been given extra doses of metoprolol to control her heart rate. She has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 30%. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, and she is being monitored for volume overload. She has a history of GERD and bowel regularity, for which she is receiving prophylactic medications. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate). She will be transferred to the floors today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has acute systolic and diastolic heart failure with reduced LVEF and increased left ventricular filling pressure. This can lead to worsening dyspnea, fluid retention, and potentially pulmonary edema if not managed properly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is in AFib, which can increase the risk of clot formation and potential"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old female with a history of congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and mild mitral regurgitation. She presented with worsening dyspnea over the past 2-3 weeks. Upon admission, her vital signs were stable, and she was comfortable but slightly confused. Physical examination revealed crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally, warm skin, and no peripheral edema. Her laboratory results showed anemia, elevated creatinine, and mildly elevated liver enzymes.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Heart Failure (CHF), both systolic and diastolic, acute exacerbation
2. Anxiety, acute onset
3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB)

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure symptoms leading to respiratory distress or pulmonary edema.
2. Development of ventricular arrhythmias due to underlying atrial fibrillation.
3. Progression of kidney dysfunction indicated by elevated creatinine levels.
4. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization in the ICU.
5. Possible nosocomial pneumonia given the prolonged ICU stay.
6. Continued confusion and delirium due to the combination of heart failure, aging, and ICU environment."
