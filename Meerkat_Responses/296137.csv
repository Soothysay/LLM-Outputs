","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma and a recent biopsy concerning for GBM. He is currently in the ICU for potential new chemotherapeutic treatment. The patient has had seizures in the past and is currently on antiepileptic agents. He presents with recent word finding difficulty, which could be a possible seizure or another neurological issue. An EEG is pending to further investigate.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 54 bpm (normal range: 39-76 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 106/62 mmHg to 114/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (normal range: 12-23 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but not on supplemental oxygen.

The patient has a left temporal mass, which was transferred for neurosurgical service and is concerning for GBM transformation. He has a history of seizures secondary to the mass and is currently receiving antiepileptic agents. The patient's neurological examination shows some difficulty with word finding and neologism, but otherwise, he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented, and has normal movement and tone.

Laboratory results show leukopenia, with a white blood cell count of 3.4 K/uL. Other lab results"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a type of malignant brain cancer. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and chemotherapy dosing. The patient has been receiving mannitol and hypertonic saline to manage cerebral edema, with acceptable parameters overnight. He is also being closely monitored for complications such as bleeding.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Leukopenia: The patient has stable leukopenia today, which is a decrease in white blood cell count. This can increase the risk of infection.
2. Cerebral Edema: The patient is being treated with mannitol to manage cerebral edema, which is swelling in the brain. If not properly managed, it can lead to increased intracranial pressure and potential brain herniation.
3. Seizure Disorder: The patient is on multiple antiseizure medications including Keppra, Ativan, and Zonigran. Seizures can occur due to the underlying brain tumor and if not controlled, can cause further neurological damage.
4. Bleeding: Due to the patient's medication regimen, including chemotherapy, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of coagulation parameters is essential.
5. Infection: The patient's low white blood cell count increases the risk of infection. Proper infection control measures should be implemented, and vigilant monitoring for signs of infection is necessary."

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of anaplastic astrocytoma, who has now been diagnosed with a left temporal lobe mass concerning for GBM transformation. He has been experiencing seizures and is currently on antiepileptic agents. The patient was transferred to the ICU for monitoring during treatment with avastin.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3 C (97.3 F), heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/64 mmHg to 117/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's lab results show normal values for hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count. However, the serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.3 mg/dL. The rest of the lab values, including electrolytes, liver function tests, and kidney function tests, are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals a decrease in peripheral pulses and skin assessment, but no other significant findings. Neurological assessment is not performed due to the patient's refusal.

The patient is currently on several medications, including atropine, mannitol, dexamethasone, and antiepileptic drugs. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a diagnosis of CNS malignancy and has started a chemotherapeutic regimen. The patient has tolerated the treatment reasonably well but continues to experience difficulty with word finding and recall. There are no focal motor deficits observed. The patient's cancer is classified as a malignant neoplasm of the brain, with associated edema. The patient's mental status has been relatively stable despite changes in the CT scan. However, there is a temporal association between Ativan dosing interval and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure disorder: The patient is currently on Keppra and Lorazepam for seizure management. It is important to monitor for any signs of seizure activity and adjust the medication dosage accordingly.
2. Edema: The patient's brain tumor is causing edema, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure. Monitoring for symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and changes in mental status is crucial. Mannitol and dexamethasone are being used to manage the edema, and regular imaging studies will help assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
3. Chemotherapy side effects: The patient is undergoing chemotherapy, which may cause various side effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and immunosuppression. Close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and regular assessment of blood counts are necessary to detect any potential complications related to chemotherapy.
4. Infection: Due to the patient's"

","The patient is a 46-year-old male with CNS malignancy titled GBM on recent biopsy. He is currently in the ICU and has shown a reasonable tolerance of initial chemotherapy. The patient's examination and imaging show minimal change in the mass, which is not unexpected. He has some persistent control of edema with decreasing Mannitol dosing.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. CNS Malignancy/Cerebral Edema: The patient's condition is related to his CNS malignancy and cerebral edema. Since he is in the ICU, close monitoring and management of his edema will be crucial to prevent further complications.

2. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a seizure disorder, and it is important to continue the current medications (Lorazepam, Keppra, and Zonegran) to manage this condition.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has bradycardia, which is an abnormally slow heart rate. This can be a complication of the cancer (malignant neoplasm), and close monitoring of the heart rhythm is necessary to prevent any further complications.

Overall, the patient's main concerns in the ICU are related to his CNS malignancy, cerebral edema, seizure disorder, and bradycardia. Close monitoring and management of these conditions are essential to ensure the patient's well-being."
