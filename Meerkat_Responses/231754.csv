   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   .
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]): Not entirely clear by
   history what precipitated respiratory decompensation.
   Differential includes
   pneumonia (including post-obstructive to NSCLC),
   flash pulmonary edema ( BNP 8000)
   heart failure
   pulmonary embolism (ltherapeutic INR, but has history of recent DVT, is
   relatively immobile, malignancy history), respiratory depression
   secondary to medications (rare percocet as ordered, no response to
   narcan),
   aspiration event
   ACS  ruled out with flat CKs.
   OSA may be contributing but not entire explanation.
   Plan:
   - Continue antibiotics, sending sputum culture, blood cultures
   - Will attempt to wean ventilator settings (going down on TV given
   respiratory alkalosis, and increase PEEP slightly) trial of pressure
   support if his mental status improves, following serial ABGs
   - Consider CT chest to further evaluate malignancy
   - Cardiac echo to look for wall motion abnormalities, diastolic
   dysfunction, RV dysfunction
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Difficult to know if this was simply related
   to hypoxia, or if this was inciting event leading to respiratory
   distress. Head CT negative for acute process. His family does report he
   had been sleeping more over the last few weeks. No clear medications
   that could be contributing (he has been on percocet, has not received
   any benadryl which is a PRN medication for him)
   - Wean propofol, monitor neurologic status
   - Consider additional work-up (eg LP, additional imaging, neurology
   consult) should his mental status not improve
   .
   #. History of DVT: Holding anti-coagulation given that he is
   therapeutic, and potential need for intervention. No clear leg
   asymmetry at present.
   .
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Per family, patient did not have
   regular follow up with his oncologist. Unclear if this was in remission
   (family suggests this may have been the case), or if this could be
   contributing to his respiratory distress.
   - Outside hospital records, consider chest CT to further evaluate
   .
   #. Hypertension: Holding BP medications given BP is currently 100-110
   systolic.
   .
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unknown baseline. BUN somewhat elevated, so
   could be pre-renal, though appears total body volume overloaded.
   Checking BNP, will follow trend, consider additional IVF's.
   - Getting outside records, consider urine electrolytes/renal ultrasound
   if off from baseline and does not improve after 4L in ED
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Unknown baseline, ALT elevated at admission, lipase
   just slightly above normal. Abdomen is large, but soft with bowel
   sounds present.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   # Borderline bradycardia: Suspect this was secondary to his
   beta-blocker, although baseline HR and EKG unknown, so could also
   represent ischemia. Appears to be stable presently without any heart
   block.
   - Continue to monitoring, holding metoprolol

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The assessment indicates that the patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not clearly due to ARDS. Other potential causes include pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, respiratory depression secondary to medications, aspiration event, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The plan includes continuing antibiotics, sending sputum culture, and blood cultures. They will attempt to wean ventilator settings and consider a CT chest to further evaluate malignancy. A cardiac echo will also be done to look for wall motion abnormalities, diastolic dysfunction, and right ventricular dysfunction.

The patient also has altered mental status, which could be related to hypoxia or an inciting event leading to respiratory distress. The family reports increased sleeping patterns in recent weeks. No clear medications are contributing to this, as he has been on percocet but has not received any Benadryl.

Propofol will be weaned, and the neurologic status will be monitored. Additional work-up, such as LP, additional imaging, and neurology consult, may be considered if the mental status does not improve.

The patient has a history of DVT and is currently on anticoagulation. However, this will be held given the therapeutic INR and potential need for intervention. There is no clear leg asymmetry at present.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress: Not entirely clear by history what
   precipitated respiratory decompensation. Differential includes
   pneumonia (including post-obstructive given no clear follow-up and
   unknown full details of his NSCLC, given question of cough at nursing
   home), flash pulmonary edema, heart failure (given edema noted on exam,
   history of possible MI in past), pulmonary embolism (less likely given
   therapeutic INR, but has history of recent DVT, is relatively immobile,
   malignancy history), respiratory depression secondary to medications
   (however only appears to have been getting percocet as ordered, no
   response to narcan), aspiration event, or ACS (appears less likely
   given flat CK hours after event). Given habitus, OSA is also a
   possibility, though this would not explain acute decline.
   - Continue antibiotics, sending sputum culture, blood cultures
   - Will attempt to wean ventilator settings (going down on TV given
   respiratory alkalosis, and increase PEEP slightly) trial of pressure
   support if his mental status improves, following serial ABGs
   - Should it prove to be difficult to wean from vent, or difficult to
   ventilate, consider CT chest to further evaluate for any component
   related to malignancy
   - Tox screen negative (although oxycodone does not appear on this
   screen)
   - Cardiac echo to look for wall motion abnormalities, diastolic
   dysfunction, RV dysfunction
   - Trend cardiac enzymes, repeat EKG in AM
   - Checking BNP
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Difficult to know if this was simply related
   to hypoxia, or if this was inciting event leading to respiratory
   distress. Head CT negative for acute process. His family does report he
   had been sleeping more over the last few weeks. No clear medications
   that could be contributing (he has been on percocet, has not received
   any benadryl which is a PRN medication for him)
   - Wean propofol, monitor neurologic status
   - Consider additional work-up (eg LP, additional imaging, neurology
   consult) should his mental status not improve
   .
   #. History of DVT: Holding anti-coagulation given that he is
   therapeutic, and potential need for intervention. No clear leg
   asymmetry at present.
   .
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Per family, patient did not have
   regular follow up with his oncologist. Unclear if this was in remission
   (family suggests this may have been the case), or if this could be
   contributing to his respiratory distress.
   - Outside hospital records, consider chest CT to further evaluate
   .
   #. Hypertension: Holding BP medications given BP is currently 100-110
   systolic.
   .
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.
   .
   # Renal insufficiency: Unknown baseline. BUN somewhat elevated, so
   could be pre-renal, though appears total body volume overloaded.
   Checking BNP, will follow trend, consider additional IVF's.
   - Getting outside records, consider urine electrolytes/renal ultrasound
   if off from baseline and does not improve after 4L in ED
   .
   # Elevated LFTs: Unknown baseline, ALT elevated at admission, lipase
   just slightly above normal. Abdomen is large, but soft with bowel
   sounds present.
   - Continue to monitor trend.
   .
   # Borderline bradycardia: Suspect this was secondary to his
   beta-blocker, although baseline HR and EKG unknown, so could also
   represent ischemia. Appears to be stable presently without any heart
   block.
   - Continue to monitoring, holding metoprolol
   .
   #. FEN: NPO currently while intubated. Will give IVF boluses to support
   BP if needed (although may actually need diuresis if BNP returns
   elevated)
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT: Already therapeutic on coumadin
   -Bowel regimen as needed
   -PPI while ventilated
   - Sedation with propofol in hope of extubation in near future, tylenol
   level is not elevated on toxicology screen.
   .
   #. ACCESS: Currently with PIV's, placing arterial line for BP and ABG
   monitoring. Should BP fall and pressor support needed, will place
   central line.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, flash pulmonary edema, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, respiratory depression secondary to medications, aspiration event, or acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It is important to continue antibiotics, send sputum culture, and blood cultures. Ventilator settings should be weaned, and a trial of pressure support should be considered if the patient's mental status improves. A CT chest may be necessary to further evaluate for any component related to malignancy.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's family reports that he has been sleeping more over the last few weeks, and a head CT is negative for acute process. The altered mental status could be related to hypoxia or an inciting event leading to respiratory distress. Propofol should be weaned, and neurologic status should be monitored. Additional work-up, such as a lumbar puncture, additional imaging, or a neurology consult, may be required if the patient's mental status does not improve.

3. History of DVT: The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Anti-coagulation should be held due to the patient being therapeutic, and potential need for intervention. No clear leg asymmetry is present at present.

4. History of lung cancer (NS"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely a combination of pt
s Cor Pulmonale
   (likely from Echo w/ RV dilation, and lung dz [**12-19**] lung ca s/p resection
   RLL) and pt likely has Obesity Hypoventilation /syndrome. In this
   setting pt developed a PNA. Evidence for a PNA seen on bronch done on
   [**2-3**] showing purulent secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered
   secretions entire R side and normal L side.
   - Pt appears to be hypercarbic at baseline [**12-19**] likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome
   - will not diurese currently since w/ Cor pulmonale pt will be preload
   dependent
   - Pt on pressure support of [**8-26**], will increase PEEP to 12 to try to
   decrease Fi02 requirement
   # PNA
 HAP, bronch done on [**2-3**] showing purulent secretions in RUL w/
   plugging and scattered secretions entire R side and normal L side.
   Currently 3+ PMN, w/ no microorganisms seen.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn day #2
   - f/u sputum cx, blood cx
   #. Altered mental status: Difficult to know if this was simply related
   to hypoxia, or if this was inciting event leading to respiratory
   distress. Head CT negative for acute process. His family does report he
   had been sleeping more over the last few weeks. No clear medications
   that could be contributing (he has been on percocet, has not received
   any benadryl which is a PRN medication for him)
   - Wean propofol, monitor neurologic status
   - Consider additional work-up (eg LP, additional imaging, neurology
   consult) should his mental status not improve
   .
   #. History of DVT: No further interventions planned, INR 2.0
   - restart coumadin today
   .
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
 likely not contributing, defer to outpt.
   # Borderline bradycardia: Suspect this was secondary to his
   beta-blocker, although baseline HR and EKG unknown, so could also
   represent ischemia. Appears to be stable presently without any heart
   block.
   - Continue to monitoring, holding metoprolol
   # Renal insufficiency: baseline 1.4. currently near baseline at 1.5
   #. Hypertension: Holding BP medications given BP is currently 100-110
   systolic.
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.
   # Elevated LFTs: Unknown baseline, ALT elevated at admission, lipase

   BP if needed (although may actually need diuresis if BNP returns
   elevated)

   #. PPX:
   -DVT: Already therapeutic on coumadin
   -Bowel regimen as needed
   -PPI while ventilated
   - Sedation with propofol in hope of extubation in near future, tylenol
   level is not elevated on toxicology screen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient has undergone several interventions, including bronchoscopy, sputum culture, and chest X-ray. He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a low heart rate (bradycardia), low blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. His laboratory results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, platelets, and lactate. The patient's mental status is altered, and he does not follow commands. There are no clear medications that could be contributing to his altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is likely due to a combination of Cor Pulmonale (likely from echocardiogram showing right ventricular dilation) and lung disease (previous lung cancer surgery). He may have obesity hypoventilation syndrome as well.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has purulent secretions in his right upper lobe, which suggests pneumonia. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Further sputum and blood cultures will be done to monitor the infection.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to hypoxia or another underlying cause. Additional work-up, such as a lumbar puncture"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on pressure support ventilation with a FiO2 of 40%. 

From the 24-hour events, it is mentioned that the patient has not shown any growth on chest x-ray and rapid response viral antigen test was positive. The patient's PEEP was decreased from 10 to 8 due to high oxygen levels. The patient received vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/62 mmHg to 147/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears to be in respiratory distress, with difficulty appreciating the jugular venous pulse due to body habitus. The cardiac examination shows regular rhythm with no murmurs or gallops. The lung examination shows clear airway sounds with good air movement bilaterally. The abdomen is slightly distended, soft, and no clear fluid wave is appreciated. There is also evidence of dependent edema up to the thighs.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 141/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on propofol infusion, and his lab results show some abnormalities including elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and elevated lactic acid levels. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and possibly cor pulmonale. He is being treated with antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications to manage his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is an infection in the lungs. If left untreated or not effectively managed, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially spread to other parts of the body.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure indicates that his lungs are not adequately supplying oxygen to his body. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly addressed and can lead to further complications such as organ damage or even death.
3. Cor Pulmonale: This is a condition where the right side of the heart fails due to long-term high blood"

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   .
   #. Respiratory distress:  Likely a combination of pt
s Cor Pulmonale
   (likely from Echo w/ RV dilation, and lung dz [**12-19**] lung ca s/p resection
   RLL) and pt likely has Obesity Hypoventilation /syndrome. In this
   setting pt developed a PNA. Evidence for a PNA seen on bronch done on
   [**2-3**] showing purulent secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered
   secretions entire R side and normal L side.
   - Pt appears to be hypercarbic at baseline [**12-19**] likely obesity
   hypoventilation syndrome
   - will not diurese currently since w/ Cor pulmonale pt will be preload
   dependent
   - Pt on pressure support of [**8-26**], will increase PEEP to 12 to try to
   decrease Fi02 requirement
   # PNA
 HAP, bronch done on [**2-3**] showing purulent secretions in RUL w/
   plugging and scattered secretions entire R side and normal L side.
   Currently 3+ PMN, w/ no microorganisms seen.
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn day #2
   - f/u sputum cx, blood cx
   #. Altered mental status: Difficult to know if this was simply related
   to hypoxia, or if this was inciting event leading to respiratory
   distress. Head CT negative for acute process. His family does report he
   had been sleeping more over the last few weeks. No clear medications
   that could be contributing (he has been on percocet, has not received
   any benadryl which is a PRN medication for him)
   - Wean propofol, monitor neurologic status
   - Consider additional work-up (eg LP, additional imaging, neurology
   consult) should his mental status not improve
   .
   #. History of DVT: No further interventions planned, INR 2.0
   - restart coumadin today
   .
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
 likely not contributing, defer to outpt.
   # Borderline bradycardia: Suspect this was secondary to his
   beta-blocker, although baseline HR and EKG unknown, so could also
   represent ischemia. Appears to be stable presently without any heart
   block.
   - Continue to monitoring, holding metoprolol
   # Renal insufficiency: baseline 1.4. currently near baseline at 1.5
   #. Hypertension: Holding BP medications given BP is currently 100-110
   systolic.
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.
   # Elevated LFTs: Unknown baseline, ALT elevated at admission, lipase
   just slightly above normal.
   .
   #. FEN: NPO currently while intubated. Will give IVF boluses to support
   BP if needed (although may actually need diuresis if BNP returns
   elevated)
   .
   #. PPX:
   -DVT: Already therapeutic on coumadin
   -Bowel regimen as needed
   -PPI while ventilated
   - Sedation with propofol in hope of extubation in near future, tylenol
   level is not elevated on toxicology screen.
   .
   #. ACCESS: Currently with PIV's, placing arterial line for BP and ABG
   monitoring. Should BP fall and pressor support needed, will place
   central line.

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness.

The patient has been intubated and placed on pressure support ventilation. His blood oxygenation is being maintained with an FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 8 cmH2O. He is currently sedated with propofol.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98.1°F)
- Heart rate: 62 bpm
- Blood pressure: 141/62 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 16 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97%

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities:
- White blood cell count: 6.7 K/uL
- Hemoglobin: 13.3 g/dL
- Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
- Sodium: 137 mEq/L
- Potassium: 4.0 mEq/L
- Glucose: 89 mg/dL

The patient's imaging results show evidence of right upper lobe consolidation with purulent secretions on bronchoscopic examination, suggesting pneumonia.

The patient's current medications include:
- Vancomycin
- Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)
- Propofol

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and unresponsiveness indicate respiratory failure. The underlying cause may be a combination of cor pulmonale (likely from echo with RV dilation, and lung disease) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Pneumonia (PNA): The presence of purulent secretions in the right upper lobe on bronchoscopic examination suggests pneumonia. The patient is already receiving antibiotics (Vancomycin and Zosyn).
3. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which could be related to hypoxia or an inciting event leading to respiratory distress. Further evaluation is needed, including a head CT and additional work-up if the mental status does not improve.
4. History of DVT: The patient has a history of DVT, and no further interventions are planned. Restarting Coumadin today.
5. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): The patient has a history of stage III NSCLC that was surgically resected and received chemotherapy in [2097] and [2098]. The recent CT scan showed stable disease.
6. Borderline bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is on the lower end of normal, and it is unclear whether this is due to his beta-block"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with a chief complaint of pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/59 mmHg to 155/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's medical history includes a history of DVT, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency), cor pulmonale, and poor mental status at admission. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume of 342 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 68 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 343, and oxygen consumption (VO2) of 6.3 L/min.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count (WBC) of 6.7 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) of 42.3%, platelet count (Plt) of 154 K/uL, serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.4 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.08 ng/mL, blood glucose level of 89 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

Imaging reveals persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray (CXR). The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute pneumonia, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), cor pulmonale, poor mental status, hypertension (HTN), and code status of full code.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), and the risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Additionally, there is a concern for the development of further complications related to the patient's underlying medical conditions, such as worsening renal function or cardiac complications."

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.6-4.8 thousand/mm3, hematocrit (Hct) of 39.9-41.0%, platelet (Plt) count of 135-162 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.3-1.6 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 75-107 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.10 ng/mL.

The patient has several medical conditions, including respiratory failure, pneumonia (PNA), bronchitis, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, cor pulmonale, and a history of DVT, lung cancer, hypertension, renal insufficiency, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypothyroidism, and possible feeding tube (FEN) placement.

The patient's treatment plan includes increasing ventilatory support to 14, rechecking ABG, and planning for spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) tomorrow morning. Antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) will be continued for PNA, and sputum and blood cultures will be followed up. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to the pulmonary process initially, as the patient was able to wake up when propofol was weaned off. 

The patient's history of DVT will be managed with continued use of coumadin, with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) target of 1.6. The patient's lung cancer, which is stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), was previously treated with lobectomy and chemotherapy, but the most recent CT scan showed stable"

   Imaging: [**2-3**] ECHO
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The right ventricular cavity is dilated with moderate global
   free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally
   normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears grossly
   normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic
   pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left ventricular
   hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function. Right ventricular
   cavity enlargement with free wall hypokines. These findings are
   suggestive of a primary pulmonary process.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient required invasive ventilation and was reintubated due to hypoxia and inability to clear secretions. He has a positive MRSA screen and purulent secretions in his right upper lobe. The patient is hypervolemic and has altered mental status, likely due to a pulmonary process. He also has a history of renal insufficiency, hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), hypothyroidism, and lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the need for invasive ventilation suggest a high risk of respiratory failure.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of purulent secretions in the right upper lobe indicates a possible pneumonia.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a known history of DVT, which increases the risk of further thrombotic events.
5. Pulmonary embolism: The combination of lung cancer, DVT, and respiratory distress could potentially lead to a pulmonary embolism.
6. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient was initially intubated and placed on invasive ventilation. He was extubated but later reintubated due to hypoxia while on CPAP. He received treatment for pneumonia (PNA) and was started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient has been receiving heparin sodium infusion and propofol. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate within normal range, blood pressure slightly low, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 95%. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the noted respiratory distress. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and normal electrolyte levels. The echocardiogram reveals mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global systolic function, right ventricular cavity enlargement with free wall hypokinesis, and no significant valvular abnormalities. The patient has a history of DVT, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and lung cancer.

   secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered secretions entire R side
   and normal L side) . Bronch and sputum cultures with polys but no
   microorganisms seen. MRSA screen positive. Failed [**2-5**] extubation
   attempt due to oral secretions
   - Scopolamine patch for secretions
   - wean vent prn
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn day #6/ 10
   - consider repeat CT chest to eval for recurrent malignancy
   contributing to resp failure, however bronch cytology neg, already had
   CTA on this admission
   #. Right heart failure: Etiology OSA vs PE vs malignancy related
   - CTA without PE
   #. Hypervolemia- will try lasix 20 IV x1, goal neg 1L
   #. Altered mental status: Likely due to pulmonary process initially as
   pt able to wake up when propofol weaned off.
   - minimize propofol
   #. History of DVT: Continue coumadin, INR 1.6
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
   - Concerning for contribution to resp failure given no improvement
   #. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol, watching for bradycardia.
   # Renal insufficiency: at baseline

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with acute on chronic respiratory failure. They have been intubated and are unable to provide a history as they are sedated. The patient has a positive fluid balance over the past 24 hours and continues to require mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 102-167 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation level of 95%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their weight is currently 105.1 kg, with a height of 69 inches.

In terms of fluid balance, the patient has received a total of 1,514 mL of fluids since midnight, with 955 mL being given through the oral route, 195 mL through the total parenteral nutrition (TPN), and 1,320 mL through intravenous fluids. The patient has also had a total output of 978 mL, consisting of 978 mL of urine output, 490 mL of blood product output, and 490 mL of other output.

Regarding respiratory support, the patient is on a ventilator with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 450-500 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 24 cmH2O, and compliance of 32.1 cmH2O/mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values show pH at 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) at 55 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) at 156 mmHg, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 95%, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) at 37 mEq/L.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count of 6.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 40.2%, platelet (Plt) count of 166 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 88 mg/dL, and sodium (Na+) level of 139 mEq/L.

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE secondary to pneumonia.  CXR improved.
   Very sedated on porpofol this morning, will decrease and reassess
   mental status.  Day #7 vanco/zosyn.  Still with moderate oral
   secretions on scopolamine patch.  Still now gag.  Continue to gently
   diurese.  His mental status is main limiting factor as well as upper
   airway secretions, lack of gag reflex.  Will lighten up sedation and
   reassess neurologically.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Repeat head CT not revealing. TSH/T4 most
   suggestive of sick euthyroid, on replacement.  Plan for neuro
   evaluation.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Known HAP based on [**2-3**] bronch (purulent
   secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered secretions entire R side
   and normal L side) . Bronch and sputum cultures with polys but no
   microorganisms seen. MRSA screen positive. Failed [**2-5**] extubation
   attempt due to oral secretions
   - Scopolamine patch for secretions
   - wean vent prn
   - continue Vanc/Zosyn day #7/ 10
   - consider repeat CT chest to eval for recurrent malignancy
   contributing to resp failure, however bronch cytology neg, already had
   CTA on this admission
   # AMS- intially after extubation pt conversing well, but pt did not
   have gag reflex. This may be due to prolonged intubation vs. CN defect.
   Pt had air on CT scan suggesting air embolus, now w/ new CT not showing
   this nor any infarcted area from an air embolus. Sz possible. Infection
   not worsening. Electrolytes stable not likely contributing.
   - wean propofol
   - recheck UA
   - check LFTs
   - recheck TSH
   - will consult Neuro
   #. Right heart failure: Etiology OSA vs PE vs malignancy related
   - CTA without PE
   #. Hypervolemia- continue diuresis, will be cautious to decrease
   preload too much from likely pulm HTN and being preload dept- - lasix
   20 IV x1 today, goal negative 1L
   #. History of DVT: Continue coumadin, INR 1.6
   - will increase coumadin to 5mg if pt not getting another source of
   vit. K
 will investigate
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Hypothyroidism: sick euthyroid. continue levothyroxine
   - rechecking TSH for AMS
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
   - Concerning for contribution to resp failure given no improvement
   #. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol, watching for bradycardia.
   # Renal insufficiency: at baseline
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.
   #. FEN: continuing TF

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. The patient presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. 

The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has received various treatments including antibiotics, diuretics, and anticoagulants. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated temperature, normal blood pressure, and normal heart rate. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and an oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's physical examination reveals several findings including papules with crust over the chin and face, mild erythema, no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus, clear ocular movements, supple neck, no jugular venous distention (JVD), and no murmurs or gallops on cardiac examination. The patient also has 3 to 4+ pitting edema up to the thighs, scattered excoriations, and no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination shows that the patient is intubated and grimaces to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and normal creatinine level. Electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies include a CT scan of the head, which shows"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the given information are as follows:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) based on bronchoscopic findings of purulent secretions in the right upper lobe with plugging. There is also a positive MRSA screen. The patient's failed extubation attempt due to oral secretions indicates difficulty weaning him off the ventilator.

2. Delirium/Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient initially had altered mental status after extubation but became conversing well. However, he did not have a gag reflex, which may be due to prolonged intubation or a cranial nerve defect. The absence of air on the CT scan rules out the possibility of an air embolism.

3. Right Heart Failure: The patient has signs of right heart failure, possibly caused by obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), pulmonary embolism (PE), or malignancy-related causes. A CT angiography (CTA) was performed but did not show any PE.

4. Hypervolemia: The patient is hypervolemic,"

   Imaging:
   NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT: There is no evidence of hemorrhage and no change
   from
   six days prior. Again there are pronounced periventricular
   hypodensities
   likely reflecting chronic microvascular ischemic disease. The
   ventricles and
   sulci are normal in size and configuration. Hyperdense soft tissue
   changes
   overlying the left greater than right occiput are slightly more
   prominent than
   prior exam, consistent with small subcutaneous hematomas. There is new
   moderate opacification within the right sphenoid sinus and persistent
   oropharyngeal secretions. Previously seen tubular lucencies within the
   right
   pterygoid muscles and venous structures have resolved.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. No acute intracranial process including no evidence of hemorrhage.
   2. Resolution of previously seen air within the venous system.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. 

The patient's recent events include:
- At noon, the patient became bradycardic and hypotensive after adjusting the endotracheal tube. Levophed was started for 5 minutes, and the patient's mean arterial pressure (MAP) recovered quickly.
- The patient's chest X-ray and central line evaluation were negative. Arterial blood gas (ABG) values were stable with a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 51 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 73%.
- Neurology was consulted for altered mental status (AMS), but the patient became alert and conversing during the evaluation. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was considered if the patient continues to fluctuate, but this has not been done yet.
- The patient received an injection of vitamin K (18.7 mcg, which is 23% of the required dose) and increased Coumadin to 5 mg.
- The final computed tomography (CT) scan showed no air in the venous system.
- Allergies: No known drug allergies.
- Last doses of antibiotics: Vancomycin on 02/09/2102 at 08:25 PM"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]):  More awake this morning,
   has a cough and gag albeit somewhat weak.  Try back on PSV.  Still with
   oral secretions, renew scopolamine patch. Completing abx course for
 TACHY/BRADY ARRHYTHMIAS:  Not clear why this gentleman has
   intermittent decreased responsiveness.  Raises concern that he may be
   intermittently hypotensive in setting or arrhythmias,lacunar infarcts.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, DVT, and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation support and has had multiple interventions to manage his condition. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 126/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with some withdrawal responses to noxious stimuli.

Physical examination reveals normal airway sounds bilaterally, but with transmitted upper airway sounds anteriorly. The patient has a distended abdomen, 3-4+ pitting edema up to the thighs, and scattered excoriations on the skin. Neurological examination shows normal tone and grimacing to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated potassium level. Imaging studies show no evidence of pulmonary embolism, but there are signs of pneumonia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has known hospital-acquired pneumonia, which is contributing to his respiratory failure. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. It is planned to continue these medications"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension.
- He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness.
- The patient has been experiencing hematuria with clots obstructing the Foley catheter. The Foley catheter was replaced with a triple lumen catheter for continuous bladder irrigation (CBI).
- He is intubated and sedated, with withdrawal responses to noxious stimuli. The patient's tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) were agreed upon in a family meeting.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/47 to 206/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- His heart rhythm is a first-degree AV block, and he has 3 to 4+ pitting edema up to his thighs.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 171 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 34% to 37.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 170 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 20 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0, and glucose level of 113 mg/dL.
- The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume (Vt) of 418 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals papules with crust over the chin, face, and mild erythema, as well as scattered excoriations on his legs.
- The patient's neurologic examination shows normal tone, grimaces to noxious stimuli, and the inability to follow commands due to sedation.
- The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with MRSA, AMS, hypervolemia, history of DVT, hematuria, hypothyroidism, history of lung cancer, hypertension, renal insufficiency, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic microvascular ischemia.
- The patient's assessment and plan include continuing diuresis for hypervolemia, weaning pressure support and checking arterial blood gas (ABG), last day of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, tracheostomy and PEG placement, scopolamine patch for secretions, checking urinalysis, urine culture, and cytology for hematuria, holding anticoagulation and administering Vitamin K, rechecking Hct and"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Known HAP based on [**2-3**] bronch (purulent
   secretions in RUL w/ plugging and scattered secretions entire R side
   and normal L side) . Bronch and sputum cultures with polys but yeast
   and no microorganisms seen. MRSA screen positive. Failed [**2-5**]
   extubation attempt due to oral secretions, AMS and lack of gag. CTA
   without PE of evidence of recurrent malignancy.  Family agrees to trach
   if necessary but seems to have improved MS with change in sedation from
   propofol to versed and fentanyl.
   - Scopolamine patch for secretions
   - tolerating pressure support well.
   - finished course of antibiotics.
   - lack of gag concerning for potential extubation, but given no other
   neuro deficits, likely due to med or ETT effects
   - plan to wean pressure support today, SBP and ABG in AM and
   potentially extubate if all goes well
   - hold TF after midnight
   - if becomes agitated due to resp status, will increase pressure
   support prior to reverting to AC
   # AMS- Resolved when neuro saw pt. Likely waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], secondary
   to pneumonia vs hypoperfusion in setting of bradycardia in setting of
   poor reserve due to chronic microvascular ischemia.
   - F/u neuro recs
   #. Hypervolemia- continue diuresis, will be cautious to decrease
   preload too much from likely pulm HTN and being preload dept- - lasix
   20 IV x1 today, goal negative 1L
   #. History of DVT: Holding anticoagulation given plan for trach and
   hematuria
   #. Hematuria: Now improved after CBI. Initially with clots requiring
   replacement of foley with triple lumen for CBI. No known trauma or
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation held, given K.
   - check UA, UCx, cytology
   - [**Hospital1 7**] Hct check as has dropped 6 points with this bleeding.
   - CBI stopped
   - urology curbsided, outpt followup.
   #. Hypothyroidism: sick euthyroid. continue levothyroxine
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
   - Concerning for contribution to resp failure given no improvement
   #. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol at lower dose, watching for
   bradycardia.  Consider hydralazine or captopril if bradycardic but
   hypertensive.
   # Renal insufficiency: at baseline
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place, BP currently on
   lower side.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has had several events over the past 24 hours. These include hematuria with clots obstructing the Foley catheter, which was replaced with a triple lumen catheter and started on continuous bladder irrigation (CBI). The patient's Hct dropped from 37% to 34%. The family agreed to a tracheostomy if necessary, but the patient's mental status improved with a change in sedation from propofol to versed and fentanyl.

The patient's respiratory status has improved, and he is now tolerating pressure support well. His fever has resolved, and he has finished his course of antibiotics. There are concerns about gag reflex due to medications or endotracheal tube effects, making extubation challenging. The plan is to wean pressure support today and potentially extubate if all goes well.

The patient also has hypervolemia, and diuresis will continue to decrease preload. The patient's history of DVT is being monitored, and anticoagulation is currently held due to the planned tracheostomy and recent hematuria. The cause of hematuria is still under investigation, with no known trauma or supratherapeutic anticoagulation. The patient's Hct has dropped"

   he is more responsive on versed/ fentanyl infusions. he has less oral
   secretions too.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a past medical history of lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and hypertension. He presents with respiratory distress and unresponsiveness. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. His condition has improved with the use of pressure support ventilation (PSV) and a change in sedation from propofol to versed and fentanyl. The family has agreed to a tracheostomy if necessary. The patient's hematuria has resolved, and he is tolerating pressure support well. The plan is to wean off pressure support today and potentially extubate if all goes well. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory distress and unresponsiveness suggests the possibility of respiratory failure due to a hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The presence of purulent secretions in the right upper lobe (RUL) and scattered secretions in the right side bronchus indicates an infection. The MRSA screen being positive further supports this possibility. The patient's history of lung cancer may also contribute to his respiratory failure.
2. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI): The patient's bradycardia and poor reserve due to chronic microvascular ischemia raise concerns for a possible AMI. This is especially relevant given his history of hypertension and lung cancer.
3. Hypervolemia: The patient's fluid balance"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 77 year old male with past medical history of lung cancer,
   DVT at OSH, and hypertension who presents with respiratory distress and
   unresponsiveness.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Succeeded in spontaneous breathing trial this
   a.m. but likely would fail extubation today as mental status not alert
   enough, poor cough and still not clearing secretions.
   - Scopolamine patch for secretions
   - tolerating pressure support well, will do spontaneous breathing trial
   tomorrow w/ plan for possible extubation if alert and can control
   secretions.
   - finished course of antibiotics.
   - D/c standing sedation w/ boluses PRN
   - hold TF after midnight
   - if becomes agitated due to resp status, will increase pressure
   support prior to reverting to AC
   # AMS- Improving w/ decreased sedation
   - F/u neuro recs
   #. Hypervolemia- Still appears volume overloaded w/ peripheral edema.
   continue diuresis, will be cautious to decrease preload too much from
   likely pulm HTN and being preload dept- - lasix 20 IV x1 today, goal
   negative 1L
   #. History of DVT: Holding anticoagulation given plan for trach and
   hematuria. Will need to validate whether he actually had a DVT at OSH.
   - LENIs
   - Consider IV filter if LENI +
   #. Hematuria: Now improved after CBI. Initially with clots requiring
   replacement of foley with triple lumen for CBI. No known trauma or
   supratherapeutic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation held, given K.  Hct
   on recheck was 30, appears stable now.
   - Transfuse <25 given Hx of CAD
   #. Hypothyroidism: sick euthyroid. continue levothyroxine
   #. History of lung cancer (NSCLC): Stage III NSCLC s/p RLL lobectomy
   received chemo in [**2097**] and [**2098**]. CT in [**4-22**] showed stable, and had not
   seen a doctor since [**2098**].
   - Concerning for contribution to resp failure given no improvement
   #. Hypertension: Continue metoprolol at lower dose, watching for
   bradycardia.  Consider hydralazine or captopril if bradycardic but
   hypertensive.
   # Renal insufficiency: at baseline
   #. BPH: Holding BPH medications as foley in place

From the progress note, it is mentioned that the patient became agitated and tachycardic when pressure support was weaned from 8-21 to 3-21. The patient was returned to 15/5 pressure support, but did not calm down. A fentanyl bolus of 100 mg was given, and the patient was oversedated with respiratory depression. The patient was later changed back to pressure support of 3-21 and completed a spontaneous breathing trial.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 133/54 to 196/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's weight is currently 103.4 kg.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and metoprolol. The patient has also been on antibiotics, specifically vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam.

   without PE of evidence of recurrent malignancy.  Family agrees to trach
   if necessary but seems to have improved MS with change in sedation from
   propofol to versed and fentanyl.
   - Scopolamine patch for secretions
   - tolerating pressure support well.
   - finished course of antibiotics.
   - lack of gag concerning for potential extubation, but given no other
   neuro deficits, likely due to med or ETT effects
   - plan to wean pressure support today, SBP and ABG in AM and
   potentially extubate if all goes well
   - hold TF after midnight
   - if becomes agitated due to resp status, will increase pressure
   support prior to reverting to AC
   # AMS- Resolved when neuro saw pt. Likely waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**], secondary
   to pneumonia vs hypoperfusion in setting of bradycardia in setting of

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]) -- persistent.  Attributed to
   pneumonia.  Also with evidence for right hemidiaphragm elevation,
   likely due to prior surgical resection.  COntineu mechanical
   ventilation
   HEMATURIA -- improved, now with clots.  Monitor.  URology revaluated --
   no plans for
   h/o DVT -- anticoagulation on hold.  Repeat LE NIVS (no documentation
   available at [**Hospital1 19**]) as anticoagulation on hold --> may need IVC filter
   if DVT present and no anticoagulation planned.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated due to poor tolerance to weaning strategies. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there is evidence of right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to prior surgical resection. The patient will continue with mechanical ventilation.

The patient also has hematuria that has improved but is now with clots. Monitoring is recommended, and further evaluation by a urologist is needed. The patient's history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is mentioned, and anticoagulation is on hold. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter may be necessary if DVT is present and no anticoagulation is planned.

Nutritional support is on hold, and the desire is for a net negative fluid balance. The patient is also anemic, most likely due to hemorrhagic hematuria. Blood transfusion is recommended to address the anemia.

In terms of ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, and lines (arterial line and PICC line) are being managed. Prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers is in place. Measures to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also implemented.

The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is to remain in the ICU. The patient requires close monitoring and specialized care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and other medical complications. They are intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has been experiencing copious clear to white secretions and generalized weakness. They have a history of hypertension, diabetes, and possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is also being treated for anemia, hemorrhagic with hematuria, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia. The continued production of secretions and inadequate oxygenation may lead to further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of pneumonia increases the risk of worsening lung infection and potential sepsis, which can be life-threatening.
3. DVT: If the patient has a DVT, it poses a risk for pulmonary embolism (PE) if not managed appropriately. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent clot formation and potential embolization.
4. Hemorrhagic Anemia: The patient's anemia is described as hemorrhagic with evidence of hematuria. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the bleeding and to address it promptly to prevent exacerbation of anemia.
5. UTI: The patient's UTI needs to be managed effectively to prevent the spread of infection and potential complications such as sepsis.
6. Glycemic Control: The patient's glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]) -- persistent.  Attributed to
   pneumonia.  Also with evidence for right hemidiaphragm elevation,
   likely due to prior surgical resection.  More awatke, but still with
   copious secretions.  Continue  mechanical ventilation, SBT until
   secretions diminish.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Continue net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- improved, now with clots.  Monitor.  Urology revaluated --
   no plans for intervention.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- initiate ciprofloxicin.
   h/o DVT -- anticoagulation on hold.  Repeat LE NIVS (no documentation
   available at [**Hospital1 19**]) as anticoagulation on hold --> may need IVC filter
   if DVT present and no anticoagulation planned.  Awaiting final read on
   LE NIVS.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold --> resume if unable to extubate.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's respiratory status has improved, with a favorable RSBI and tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBT). However, the patient continues to experience copious clear to white secretions and generalized weakness.

The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, for which antibiotics have been administered. Fluid balance and hemodynamic monitoring indicate stable vital signs with controlled blood pressure. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and slightly elevated creatinine levels.

Assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia. The patient will continue on mechanical ventilation and SBT until secretions diminish. A net negative fluid balance is desired, and diuresis will be continued. Hematuria has improved but will be monitored. Blood pressure medication adjustments will be made for hypertension, and ciprofloxacin will be initiated for a suspected urinary tract infection.

Anticoagulation for a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is on hold, and further evaluation of lower extremity venous status (LE NIVS) is needed. Nutritional support through tube feeding may resume if extubation is not possible. Anemia, likely due to hemorrhagic and hematuria, has been addressed with a blood transfusion. ICU care includes glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for DVT and stress"

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resected lung cancer, hypertension, and current respiratory distress due to copious secretions. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 121/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 103.4 kg currently. He has received various medications including propofol, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and Lasix. 

The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. His blood glucose level is within normal range, but his creatinine and total bilirubin levels are slightly elevated. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, and magnesium are within normal limits.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's current issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, hypervolemia, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hematuria, hypertension, and renal insufficiency. The plan includes switching sedation to propofol, stopping total parenteral nutrition (TF) at 0500, quantifying secretions, and planning for extubation tomorrow morning if secretions decrease.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resected lung cancer and hypertension. He is currently in the ICU due to respiratory distress and copious secretions. The patient was restarted on total parenteral nutrition (TF) and is being monitored for fluid balance. He has a positive fluid balance of 775 mL since yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/40 mmHg to 105/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 397 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. His respiratory system compliance is good, and his PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 220.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake and following commands but unable to lift his head entirely off the bed. He has jugular venous distention of 3-4 cm, distant heart sounds, and scant crackles in his lungs. His abdomen is soft, non-tender, obese, and bowel sounds are present. He has trace pitting"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of resected lung cancer and hypertension. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and copious secretions.

Over the past few days, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. His vital signs have been relatively stable, with a temperature within normal range and a heart rate within the expected range for his age. His blood pressure has been well controlled, but there have been instances of hypotension. His respiratory rate has been consistent, and his oxygen saturation has remained at 97%.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation support using CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 397 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. His respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is 69, indicating the possibility of extubation but concerns about secretions persist.

The patient's physical examination shows that he is awake and following commands but unable to lift his head entirely off the bed. He has jugular venous distention (JVD) of 3-4 cm, distant heart sounds, and scant crackles in his lungs. His abdomen is soft, non"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- persistent.  Attributed to pneumonia.
   Right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to prior surgical resection &
   volume loss.  More awake, and reduced secretions.  Continue  mechanical
   ventilation, SBT --> hopefully extubation.  COnsider BiPAP if fails
   following extubation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Continue net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- improved, now with clots.  Monitor.  Urology revaluated --
   no plans for intervention.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- continue  ciprofloxicin.
   h/o DVT -- no evidence for DVT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold --> resume if unable to extubate.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient tolerated a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and has shown improvement in mental status since being extubated. The patient has a history of respiratory failure and pneumonia. They are currently on mechanical ventilation, and there are plans to consider non-invasive positive airway pressure (BiPAP) if extubation fails.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 137/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal sinus rhythm, and fluid balance indicates a negative fluid balance since 12 AM.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's renal function is normal with a creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 mg/dL. The patient has been on systemic anticoagulation with heparin sodium since February 14th.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of respiratory compromise. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. Neurological examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and has normal muscle tone"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- persistent.  Attributed to pneumonia.
   Right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to prior surgical resection &
   volume loss.  More awake, and reduced secretions.  Continue  mechanical
   ventilation, SBT --> hopefully extubation.  COnsider BiPAP if fails
   following extubation.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Continue net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- improved, now with clots.  Monitor.  Urology revaluated --
   no plans for intervention.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- continue  ciprofloxicin.
   h/o DVT -- no evidence for DVT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold --> resume if unable to extubate.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's respiratory secretions have decreased, and they are more awake since discontinuing sedation. The plan is to continue mechanical ventilation and perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) with the hope of eventually extubating the patient. If extubation fails, BiPAP may be considered.

The patient has a history of hemorrhagic anemia, likely due to hematuria. This condition has been managed with a blood transfusion. The underlying pathology of the anemia is still unclear.

Other issues mentioned in the progress note include hypertension (HTN), which is being adjusted with medication, urinary tract infection (UTI) being treated with ciprofloxacin, and a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without current evidence.

The patient's nutritional support has been temporarily halted but may resume if extubation is not successful. The patient's fluid balance is being closely monitored, aiming for a net negative fluid balance. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prevention with an H2 blocker, venous thromboembolism (VAP) prevention through elevation of the head of bed (HOB), mouth care, daily wake-up calls, and respiratory system assessment using the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI).

Overall, the patient's condition remains critical, and careful monitoring and management are"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M w/ PMH of resected lung CA, HTN p/w respiratory distress and
   copius secretions, now reintubated and with NSTEMI and VAP.
   # NSTEMI:  Patient had transiently become hypotensive overnight, of
   unclear etiology.  Patient had lateral precordial TWIs and elevated
   cardiac enzymes, (MBI 15, Trop 0.82) suggestive of NSTEMI.  Second set
   CE show falling CK and Troponin.  Patient not in cardiogenic shock.
   Patient has worsening RLL opacity, unclear if related to cardiogenic
   edema versus ventilator associated PNA.  Patient with mild temp 100.3
   and could be associated with PNA versus MI.  Patient received ASA
   325mg, Lopressor 12,5mg once, and Simvastatin 80mg.  Given patient
   response to BP medications and propensity to hypotension, will start
   esmolol gtt later this afternoon.  Holding Captopril currently in
   setting of hypotension.
   -          ASA 325mg daily
   -          Simvastatin 80mg daily
   -          Esmolol gtt later this afternoon
   -          Transfuse 2u PRBCs in setting of NSTEMI for goal > 30
   -          Monitor this afternoon to see if patient needs further
   diruesis.
   # Ventilator Associated Pneumonia:  Patient was extubated and
   subsequently re-intubated yesterday as he was unable to clear his
   secretion with adequate cough, and had worsening CO2 retention.
   Yesterday evening, had Temp 100.3, CXR showed worsening RLL opacity.
   Given patient
s multiple re-intubation, it is possible and important to
   cover for VAP.  Patient received Vanc/Zosyn overnight, however in light
   of patient
s poor sensitivties to Psudomonal UTI, will switch to
   cefepime.  Patient has no anaerobic coverage currently.
   -          Change Vancomycin dose to 1.25g q12hrs
   -          d/c Zosyn
   -          Start Cefepime 2g q8hrs
   -          Monitor Fever curve, worsening leukocytosis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient currently intubated and failed
   extubation yesterday.  Patient was not able to clear secretions well.
   Patient is maintaining saturations well with 40% FiO2 and can
   decrease.  Patient will need Trach and Peg by IP, however it is unclear
   if patient will be good candidate in setting of NSTEMI.  Patient will
   need to be monitored.  For now, can decrease PEEP to 5 in preparation
   for possible Trach/Peg.
   -          Decrease PEEP to 5
   -          Decrease FiO2 to 0.3
   -          Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation.
   -          IP recommendations
   # Hypotension:   Transient overnight with systolic BPs as low as 80.
   Patient responded to small fluid challenge, unclear etiology as patient
   was previously hypertensive.  BP was 130s this AM.  In setting of
   NSTEMI and hypotension, will need to continue BB to achieve lower HR
   (with esmolol gtt) and hold Captopril for now.
   -          Continue BB
   # Psueudomonas UTI:  Day [**1-21**].  Patient was on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] switch to
   cefepime to cover for Pseudomonas for possible VAP etiology.
   -          Start Cefepime to cover UTI and VAP
   # Hematuria:  Likely secondary to UTI versus foley trauma from
   agitation.  Patient currently undergoing CBI, urine clearing.  Patient
   had mild HCT drop in setting hematuria.
   -          Continue CBI through afternoon, will d/c once urine stays
   clear.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of resected lung cancer, hypertension, and now experiencing respiratory distress, copious secretions, NSTEMI, and VAP. The patient has been extubated and reintubated, with worsening RLL opacity on chest X-ray. He also has a fever of 100.3°F and elevated cardiac enzymes suggestive of NSTEMI. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with decreased PEEP and FiO2. He has been started on antibiotics for VAP, but due to poor sensitivities to Pseudomonas UTI, the antibiotic regimen will be changed to cover for both UTI and VAP. The patient is also being monitored for hematuria, which could be secondary to UTI or Foley trauma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a risk of developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period.
2. Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a history of pseudomonas UTI, and there is a risk of developing another UTI while in the ICU.
3. Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient has evidence of NSTEMI, indicating compromised blood flow to the heart. This condition needs to be closely monitored.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may lead to further deterioration in lung"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of resected lung cancer and hypertension. He is currently experiencing respiratory distress and copious secretions. 

The patient was previously intubated but is now extubated. However, he had lost an arterial line and his blood pressure drifted downward. To address this, the PEEP was decreased, and the patient was switched from propofol to midazolam/fentanyl, with a 500cc bolus given. The patient also has a fever, so vancomycin and zosyn were started for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) given right lower lobe opacity.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 02/15/2102 at 07:52 PM, vancomycin on 02/15/2102 at 09:00 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/15/2102 at 09:00 PM.

Infusions include fentanyl at 50 mcg/hour and midazolam (Versed) at 1 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include midazolam (Versed) and fentanyl, both started on 02/15/2102 at 03:30 PM. Heparin sodium was also started on 02/15/2102"

   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- persistent, multifactorial  (new
   pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to prior surgical
   resection & volume loss).  Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG.  Move towards Trach.  Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cefopime.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Continue net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  Urology to revaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime.
   h/o DVT -- no evidence for DVT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold --> PEG, then resume.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They were extubated yesterday but failed to improve and required reintubation. The patient also has recurrent hematuria. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and an elevated temperature. They are on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 40% and a PEEP of 8 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.41, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 463, and a respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute. The physical examination reveals an overweight or obese patient with no acute distress. The patient's cardiovascular system is normal, and their peripheral vascular system is also within normal limits. However, they have decreased breath sounds on the right side with diminished airflow. The patient's abdomen is soft and non-tender, and they have trace edema in their extremities. Neurologically, the patient is sedated but follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, and prior surgical resection. They require continued mechanical ventilation and monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG). Tracheostomy may be considered in the future.
2. Hematuria: The patient has recurrent hematur"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- persistent, multifactorial  (new
   pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely due to prior surgical
   resection & volume loss).  Continue mechanical ventilation, monitor
   ABG.  Move towards Trach.  Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cefopime.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Continue net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  Urology to revaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime.
   h/o DVT -- no evidence for DVT.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF on hold --> PEG, then resume.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   Plan to move to screening.

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of resected lung cancer and hypertension. He is currently experiencing respiratory distress and copious secretions, leading to reintubation. He also has NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia).

24-hour events:
- The patient had a fever spike at 5 am to 100.3 degrees Celsius, and a blood culture was drawn.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M w/ PMH of resected lung CA, HTN p/w respiratory distress and
   copius secretions, now reintubated and with NSTEMI and VAP.
   # NSTEMI:  Patient had transiently become hypotensive overnight, of
   unclear etiology.  Patient had lateral precordial TWIs and elevated
   cardiac enzymes, (MBI 15, Trop 0.82) suggestive of NSTEMI.  Second set
   CE show falling CK and Troponin.  Patient not in cardiogenic shock.
   Patient has worsening RLL opacity, unclear if related to cardiogenic
   edema versus ventilator associated PNA.  Patient with mild temp 100.3
   and could be associated with PNA versus MI.  Patient received ASA
   325mg, Lopressor 12,5mg once, and Simvastatin 80mg.  Given patient
   response to BP medications and propensity to hypotension, will start
   esmolol gtt later this afternoon.  Holding Captopril currently in
   setting of hypotension.
   -          ASA 325mg daily
   -          Simvastatin 80mg daily
   -          Esmolol gtt later this afternoon
   -          Transfuse 2u PRBCs in setting of NSTEMI for goal > 30
   -          Monitor this afternoon to see if patient needs further
   diruesis.
   # Ventilator Associated Pneumonia:  Patient was extubated and
   subsequently re-intubated yesterday as he was unable to clear his
   secretion with adequate cough, and had worsening CO2 retention.
   Yesterday evening, had Temp 100.3, CXR showed worsening RLL opacity.
   Given patient
s multiple re-intubation, it is possible and important to
   cover for VAP.  Patient received Vanc/Zosyn overnight, however in light
   of patient
s poor sensitivties to Psudomonal UTI, will switch to
   cefepime.  Patient has no anaerobic coverage currently.
   -          Change Vancomycin dose to 1.25g q12hrs
   -          d/c Zosyn
   -          Start Cefepime 2g q8hrs
   -          Monitor Fever curve, worsening leukocytosis.
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient currently intubated and failed
   extubation yesterday.  Patient was not able to clear secretions well.
   Patient is maintaining saturations well with 40% FiO2 and can
   decrease.  Patient will need Trach and Peg by IP, however it is unclear
   if patient will be good candidate in setting of NSTEMI.  Patient will
   need to be monitored.  For now, can decrease PEEP to 5 in preparation
   for possible Trach/Peg.
   -          Decrease PEEP to 5
   -          Decrease FiO2 to 0.3
   -          Continue Fentanyl/Midazolam for sedation.
   -          IP recommendations
   # Hypotension:   Transient overnight with systolic BPs as low as 80.
   Patient responded to small fluid challenge, unclear etiology as patient
   was previously hypertensive.  BP was 130s this AM.  In setting of
   NSTEMI and hypotension, will need to continue BB to achieve lower HR
   (with esmolol gtt) and hold Captopril for now.
   -          Continue BB
   # Psueudomonas UTI:  Day [**1-21**].  Patient was on [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] switch to
   cefepime to cover for Pseudomonas for possible VAP etiology.
   -          Start Cefepime to cover UTI and VAP
   # Hematuria:  Likely secondary to UTI versus foley trauma from
   agitation.  Patient currently undergoing CBI, urine clearing.  Patient
   had mild HCT drop in setting hematuria.
   -          Continue CBI through afternoon, will d/c once urine stays
   clear.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a medical history of resected lung cancer, hypertension, who presented with respiratory distress and copious secretions. He was reintubated and diagnosed with NSTEMI and VAP. The patient's temperature spiked to 100.3°F, and he has been experiencing hypotension, requiring continuous esmolol infusion. He is currently on ASA, HD Statin, and receiving antibiotics for suspected VAP. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/61 mmHg to 125/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. His physical examination reveals distant heart sounds, scant crackles laterally in the lungs, and trace pitting edema without sacral edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.9 K/uL and elevated cardiac enzymes (CK 37, Troponin-T 0.82). The patient's blood cultures show growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's reintubation and worsening lung opacity, there is a concern for VAP. Appropriate antibiotics have been started, and the patient's fever curve and leukocytosis will be monitored.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial"

   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.  Move to Trach.  Antimicrobials --> Vanco,
   Cefopime.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Would like to better control HR with beta-blocker if BP
   tolerates.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  Urology to revaluate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and other medical conditions. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs, including temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, are within normal ranges. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments for their conditions, including antibiotics, pain relief, and blood transfusions. The patient's laboratory results show normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets, and electrolytes. However, there are elevated levels of troponin-T and lactate. The patient's nutritional support is being managed through enteral feeding. The patient's anemia is suspected to be due to hemorrhagic causes, such as hematuria. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of respiratory failure is not adequately treated.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory complications and systemic infection if not appropriately managed.
3. NSTEMI: The patient experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications in the future.
4. Hematuria: The recurrent hematuria could indicate ongoing bleeding in the urinary tract, which needs to be investigated and managed to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and other medical conditions. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of recurrent respiratory failure after extubation attempts, new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, and surgical resection with volume loss. The patient also has NSTEMI, anemia, hemorrhagic hematuria, hypertension, and a possible urinary tract infection. Nutritional support is being planned, and the patient is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
   - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
   - Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high airway pressures
   - Pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

2. Cardiovascular Complications:
   - Cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)
   - Arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation
   - Hypotension or septic shock due to infection

3. Hematological Complications:
   - Further bleeding or hemorrhage due to coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia
   - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

4. Renal Complications:
   - Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypoperfusion, sepsis, or nephrotoxic drugs
   - Uremia or electrolyte imbalances

5. Infectious Complications:
   - Sepsis or septic shock due to pneumonia or urinary tract infection
   - Meningitis or other infections related to the invasive lines or devices

6. Gastrointestinal Complications:
   - Stress ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding
   - Hepatic dysfunction or liver failure

7. Nutritional Complications:
   - Malnutrition or inadequate nutritional support

8. Other Complications:
   - Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)
   - Pressure ulcers or bedsores
   - Delirium or ICU psychosis

The patient's critically ill condition with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) increases the risk of various medical complications. Close monitoring and prompt management are necessary to prevent and treat these complications."

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's blood cultures are negative to date, and he is currently being treated empirically with meropenem for suspected VAP.
- The patient has a history of pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), for which he was initially started on ciprofloxacin, then cefepime, and now will be changed to meropenem due to Klebsiella in the sputum.
- The patient's troponin levels are falling, indicating improvement in NSTEMI.
- The patient has failed extubation twice and is currently intubated. A tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been discussed for Monday, with the family in agreement.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. on Monday (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cefopime.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  Urology to revaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient's sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and he has been started on meropenem empirically. His blood cultures are negative to date. The patient has a history of failed extubation twice and will undergo tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on Monday. He also has a pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), which is being treated with meropenem. The patient's hematuria has resolved, and he has a Foley catheter in place for bladder management. He is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and has a PICC line and arterial line in place for medication administration and monitoring. The patient's condition is stable, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed VAP, which is a common complication in patients who are on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. It is important to monitor his respiratory status and continue with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's cardiac status should be closely monitored due to the presence of NSTEMI. Regular ECG"

   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss).  Continue mechanical
   ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. on Monday (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cefopime.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Pt. Is critically ill
   Total time spent: 35 minutes
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to recurrent respiratory failure following extubation attempts. The patient has pneumonia, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by Klebsiella. Antibiotics have been adjusted accordingly.

The patient also has a right hilar lung mass, which requires further investigation once infections are resolved. Additionally, an infrarenal aneurysm measuring 3 cm was found incidentally and needs follow-up. The patient has left U-P junction obstruction, which will require US follow-up to determine if it is anatomical.

The patient experienced a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) during episodes of respiratory distress. The plan is to continue medical therapy, prescribe a statin, and transfuse to maintain a hematocrit level above 27%. The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled with a beta-blocker, as they have an incidental finding of an infrarenal aneurysm.

The patient has recurrent hematuria, which may be related to the recent finding of left U-P junction obstruction. Urology should reevaluate this condition. The patient has hypertension, and their medications have been adjusted.

The patient requires nutritional support and plans for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) have been made for Monday. The patient has anemia, likely due to hemorrhagic and hematuria. The underlying pathology"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The sputum culture grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, and the patient is being treated empirically with meropenem. Blood cultures have been negative to date. The patient has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections, including a recent Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. The patient also has a history of hematuria, which may be related to left ureteropelvic junction obstruction or multiple parapelvic cysts. Additionally, the patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 3 cm and choledocholithiasis without ductal dilation. The patient is currently on multiple medications for various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, and is being monitored closely for any changes or complications."

   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Await resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and a history of multiple extubation attempts. They have been mechanically ventilated and are currently sedated. The patient has several medical conditions including NSTEMI, right hilar lung mass, infrarenal aneurysm, left U-P junction obstruction, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), nutritional support needed, anemia, cholelithiasis, and hemorrhagic hematuria. The patient's vital signs are stable, and they are receiving various medications and treatments in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation or if the underlying cause of the respiratory failure is not adequately addressed.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which can progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, or other complications if not effectively treated.
3. NSTEMI: Although the patient's NSTEMI occurred in the context of respiratory distress, it is essential to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Right hilar lung mass: The presence of a right hilar lung mass could indicate an underlying malignancy or infection. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
5. Infrarenal aneurysm: The incidental finding of an infrarenal aneurysm needs to be followed up, and appropriate measures should be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Await resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M w/ respiratory failure w/ VAP and NSTEMI
   # NSTEMI: Ce
s peaked and trending downward.   A-line in place.
   Patient hemodynamically stable.
          -  Cont ASA 325mg daily
   -  Cont Simvastatin 80mg daily
   - Continue BB
   - Monitor this afternoon to see if patient needs diruesis.
   # Ventilator Associated Pneumonia:  K. pneumoniae grew from sputum,
   appears to be ESBL but is sensitive to meropenem.  Blood cultures
   negative to date.
   - F/u blood cultures
   -          Continue meropenem and vancomycin
   -      Culture if spikes
   # Respiratory failure:  Patient currently intubated. Has failed
   extubation twice.
   -          Trach/PEG likely Wed or Thurs given that anesthesia wants
   him to be further away from his NSTEMI.
   -          d/w  family about eventual goals of care.
   # Psueudomonas UTI:  Day [**4-23**], initially started on cipro, then cefepime
   now on meropenem for ESBL klebs in sputum will also cover psuedomonas.
   -          Meropenem
   # Hematuria:  Resolved.  CT showed Left UPJ obstruction versus multiple
   parapelvic cysts, which may be etiology of patient
s hematuria, versus
   Pseudomonas UTI.
   - Monitor
   # AAA:  Patient with 3cm infra-renal AAA.  In light of patient other
   co-morbidities, will clinically monitor patient.
   - Patient will need f/u CT as outpatient in 6 months
   # Choledocholithiasis without ductal dilation:  Incidental finding on

- The patient did not receive a tracheostomy or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to recent myocardial infarction (MI), as anesthesia does not want to perform these procedures.
- The patient received Lasix 40 IV, which resulted in a negative fluid balance of -1.529L (goal was -1.5L).
- The patient started on tube feeding (TF) and increased the bowel regimen.
- Telemetry showed hypertensive episodes but no arrhythmias.
- The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusion and other ICU medications such as heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and meropenem.
- The patient has a history of respiratory failure with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted conditions.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/47 mmHg to 162/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and sinus rhythm.
- The patient's weight is currently 103.4 kg, with a height of 69 inches.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Await resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, pneumonia, and recent extubation attempts. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Klebsiella has been identified as the causative organism, and antimicrobial therapy needs to be adjusted accordingly.
2. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient experienced an episode of chest pain and elevated cardiac markers, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. Further cardiac evaluation is necessary to assess the extent of cardiac involvement.
3. Right Hilary lung mass: A suspicious lung mass was noted in the right Hilary region. Further investigation with a dedicated thoracic CT scan is required to determine the nature of this mass.
4. Infrarenal aneurysm: An incidental finding of a 3 cm infrarenal aneurysm was detected. It needs to be monitored, and possibly evaluated with an ultrasound ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia, NSTEMI, right hilar lung mass, infrarenal aneurysm, left U-P junction obstruction, hypertension, UTI, nutritional support, anemia, and cholelithiasis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination shows no acute distress, an endotracheal tube, and no signs of edema or cyanosis. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal potassium levels. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring, mechanical ventilation, and antibiotic treatment. Potential complications include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and further evaluation of the right hilar lung mass, infrarenal aneurysm, and left U-P junction obstruction. The patient is currently on a net negative fluid balance, receiving diuretics, and plans for tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and transfer to a respiratory rehabilitation facility are being made."

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Cardiology consultation to assess surgical risk.   Await
   resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, pneumonia, and other medical complications. They have been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of multiple attempts at extubation, surgical resection, and volume loss, which may contribute to their respiratory distress. They also have anemia, infection, renal issues, hypertension, urinary tract infections, nutritional needs, and various other comorbidities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. This indicates severe lung dysfunction and impaired gas exchange.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, likely contributing to their respiratory failure. Klebsiella infection has been identified as the cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment with appropriate antimicrobials is necessary to control the infection.
3. NSTEMI (Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction): The patient experienced a NSTEMI during an episode of respiratory distress. It is important to manage this cardiac event with medical therapy, statin, and careful assessment of surgical risk.
4. Infrarenal Aneurysm: An incidental finding of a 3 cm infrarenal aneurysm was discovered. Regular follow-up and blood pressure control are recommended to prevent potential complications.
5. Left U-P Junction Obstruction: Recurrent hematuria has been observed, and further evaluation is needed to determine if it"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has multiple medical conditions including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and choledocholithiasis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/57 to 138/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The respiratory system is being supported with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 5.9 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 0.9 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium level of 3.9 mEq/L. The blood glucose level is within normal range at 95 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's arterial line was placed on February 17th"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Cardiology consultation to assess surgical risk.   Await
   resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Respiratory failure, pneumonia (VAP).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Cardiology consultation to assess surgical risk.   Await
   resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They are currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP), NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction), right hilar lung mass, infrarenal aneurysm, left U-P junction obstruction, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), anemia, cholelithiasis, and hemorrhagic hematuria. The patient's current plan involves continuing mechanical ventilation, adjusting antimicrobials for VAP, monitoring ABG (arterial blood gas), and considering tracheostomy. The patient's condition remains unstable, and they require close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary issue is respiratory failure, which necessitates ongoing mechanical ventilation support. Failure to improve respiratory function may result in further deterioration.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient has already developed pneumonia while on mechanical ventilation. Continued inadequate lung protection, aspiration, or colonization can lead to worsening VAP or the development of multi-drug resistant organisms.

3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of NSTEMI suggests a predisposition to cardiac events. Continued stress on the heart due to respiratory distress or inadequate oxygenation can lead to further cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has been treated for VAP for 5 days and has failed extubation twice due to secretions. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), a heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 154/71 to 103 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 85.8 kg currently.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent NSTEMI, for which the medication regimen has been optimized with beta-blockers, aspirin, ACE inhibitors, and statins. The patient also has a 3cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that will be monitored clinically without immediate intervention. An incidental finding of choledocholithiasis without ductal dilation was noted on a CT scan of the abdomen, which may require further evaluation if the patient becomes febrile. 

The patient is currently sedated with propofol in anticipation of a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and is expected to be NPO (nothing by mouth) after midnight. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure if the trach and PEG procedures are not performed successfully, further cardiac events due to the history of CAD and NSTEMI, and potential infections related to the AAA or choledocholithiasis. Additionally, the patient's glycemic control and fluid balance should be closely monitored."

   Respiratory failure, pneumonia (VAP).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.  Complete full course.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Cardiology consultation to assess surgical risk.   Await
   resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure, pneumonia (VAP).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE -- recurrent, s/p extubation attampts x2.
   Multifactorial  (new pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm elevation, likely
   due to prior surgical resection & volume loss), poor gag.  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, monitor ABG.  Plan for Trach. (in OR).
   Antimicrobials --> Vanco, Meripenem.
   PNEUMONIA -- VAP, Klebsiella (EBSL) --> adjust antimicrobials, maintain
   precautions.  Complete full course.
   NSTEMI -- occured in context of resp. distress, rather than primary
   event.  Plan continue medical [**Last Name (LF) 6752**], [**First Name3 (LF) **], statin, transfuse to >27
   Hct.  Stable.  Cardiology consultation to assess surgical risk.   Await
   resolution prior to Trach/PEG.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Received iv fluids for
   hypotension yesterday.  Resume net diuresis.
   Right HILAR LUNG MASS -- need to have f/u dedicated Thoracic CT once
   infections resolved.
   INFRARENAL ANEURYSM -- 3 cm.  Incidental finding.  Needs f/u, perhaps
   US.  COntrol BP (beta-blocker)
   LEFT U-P Junction Obstruction -- will need US follow-up, to determine
   if anatomical.
   HEMATURIA -- recurrent.  [**Month (only) 51**] be related to recent finding at LEFT U-P
   junction --> Urology to reevaluate.
   HTN -- adjusting PO meds.
   UTI -- borderline MIC to zosyn --> cefopime --> completed.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF; plan for PEG Monday.
   ANEMIA -- hemorrhagic, hematuria.  Unclear underlying pathology.  s/p
   transfusion.
   CHOLEDOCHOLITHIASIS -- asymptomatic.
   Plan to move to screening for respiratory rehab facility.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated due to recurrent respiratory failure following extubation attempts. The patient also has pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP) caused by Klebsiella and is being treated with appropriate antimicrobials. The patient's NSTEMI occurred in the context of respiratory distress and is being managed medically with statin therapy and transfusion to maintain a hematocrit level above 27%. 

The patient has several other medical issues that need to be addressed, including a right hilar lung mass, an infrarenal aneurysm, left U-P junction obstruction, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), nutritional support, anemia, and cholelithiasis. 

The patient's overall condition is unstable, and they require close monitoring and intensive care. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, progression of pneumonia, further cardiovascular events, bleeding complications due to anemia, and complications related to the other identified medical issues."

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The patient also has a 3 cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and incidental finding of choledocholithiasis on the abdominal CT scan. His recent laboratory results show normal levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, platelets, creatinine, blood glucose, and electrolytes, except for low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 124/52 mmHg to 173/89 mmHg, heart rate between 56-80 bpm, respiratory rate at 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus bradycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has VAP, which increases the risk of further respiratory infections. Monitoring for fever, increased sputum production, worsening oxygen saturation, and changes in mental status is important.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy and placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and is sedated. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 56 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/52 mmHg to 173/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg to 85.8 kg during his ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. VAP: The patient has already failed extubation twice due to secretions, indicating a risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. NSTEMI: Although the patient's wall motion abnormalities on echo were resolved, he still requires optimization of his medication regimen with beta-blockers (BB), aspirin (ASA), ACE inhibitors, and statins to manage his cardiovascular condition.
3. AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm): The patient has a 3cm infra-renal AAA, which will be clinically monitored. It is important to ensure regular follow-up with a CT scan as an outpatient in 6 months.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer, deep vein thrombosis, and heart conditions, including a recent NSTEMI. He was admitted with hospital-acquired pneumonia and is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure. The patient has undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and is on mechanical ventilation. He has also been diagnosed with pseudo-monal urinary tract infection and is receiving appropriate antibiotics. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he remains critically ill.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient's respiratory secretions may become infected, leading to pneumonia.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): As the patient has a history of DVT, there is a risk of developing another DVT or PE, especially with prolonged immobility and bed rest.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient's history of heart disease increases the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted with acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia. The patient's course has been complicated by Pseudomonas urinary tract infection (UTI), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing ventilator-associated pneumonia (ESBL VAP).

The patient's current condition is critical, and he remains on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with plans to wean as tolerated. He has undergone a percutaneous tracheostomy yesterday. The patient also has a history of NSCLC status post resection in [**2097**].

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains impaired, and there is a risk of further deterioration.
2. UTI: The patient has a history of Pseudomonas UTI, and proper infection control measures should be continued to prevent recurrent infections.
3. Myocardial infarction: The patient has experienced an NSTEMI, and ongoing cardiac monitoring is necessary.
4. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of low blood pressure, which may require close monitoring and appropriate management.
5. Fever: The patient has had some episodes of fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or another"

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 mmHg to 145/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 85.8 kg currently.

The patient is receiving several medications, including morphine sulfate for sedation and pain management, propofol for sedation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and meropenem for treatment of VAP. The patient's antibiotic therapy has been completed after an 8-day course.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. The serum creatinine (Cr) level is within normal range, but the blood glucose level is slightly elevated. Other lab values, including electrolytes, liver enzymes, cardiac markers, and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/62 to 145/98 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose levels, liver function tests, kidney function tests, electrolyte levels, and cardiac markers. However, the patient has an elevated lactate level of 0.6 mmol/L. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease with previous NSTEMI, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), choledocholithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and constipation. 

The patient's medical plan includes discontinuing meropenem, monitoring blood cultures, planning percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) by thoracics, keeping an arterial line for now, sedating with propofol and weaning as tolerated, continuing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He was admitted with pneumonia and respiratory failure, complicated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) pneumonia and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient continues to experience ongoing respiratory failure and is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV). He may undergo percutaneous endotracheal gastrointestinal (PEG) feeding tomorrow and will have propofol sedation weaned as tolerated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure persists despite treatment, indicating a potential risk of continued hypoxia and respiratory distress.
2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although not explicitly mentioned, the presence of a urinary catheter increases the risk of developing a UTI.
3. Myocardial infarction (MI), acute: The patient has already experienced an NSTEMI, and there is a possibility of further cardiac complications such as another MI.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which can compromise tissue perfusion and lead to organ dysfunction.
5. Fever: The patient has a fever, which may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process that requires further investigation.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has undergone tracheostomy and finished an 8-day course of meropenem for VAP treatment. He tolerated pressure support overnight and may need further evaluation for not coming off the ventilator completely. A plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has been made for February 28th. The patient's other medical conditions include constipation, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-NSTEMI with no wall motion abnormalities on echo, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), and choledocholithiasis without ductal dilation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Failure to wean off the ventilator: The patient may face difficulties in being taken off the ventilator, which could be related to sedation or neuromuscular weakness. Continuous monitoring and assessment will be necessary to determine the cause and appropriate intervention.
2. Constipation: The patient's constipation has resolved but will require continued bowel regimen management to prevent recurrence.
3. Coronary artery disease (CAD) post-NSTEMI: The patient's CAD and recent NSTEMI should be closely monitored with optimized medication regimen including beta-blocker (BB), aspirin (ASA), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), and statin.
4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): The patient has a 3cm infrarenal AAA, which will be clinically monitored due to the patient's other comorbidities. A follow-up CT scan is planned in 6 months.
5. Choledocholithiasis: The patient has an incidental finding of choledocholithiasis without ductal dilation on CT abdomen. If the patient becomes febrile, a biliary source of infection should be considered, and appropriate management should be initiated.
6. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): The patient has a Foley catheter in place to manage BPH.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prophylaxis: The patient is receiving subcutaneous heparin for DVT prophylaxis and bowel regimen for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Overall, the patient's medical conditions require close monitoring, and appropriate interventions should be implemented to address any potential complications that may arise."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's recent events include a plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on February 28th with Dr. [Last Name (STitle) 2233], and [Name (STitle) 6939] screening for rehab likely to go home on vent.

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received various medications including meropenem, pantoprazole, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/43 mmHg to 144/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination reveals distant heart sounds with regular rhythm, decreased breath sounds on the lower lateral aspect of the right lung, soft and nontender abdomen, and mild lower extremity edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

The patient's assessment and plan include stable respiratory failure, successful tracheostomy, completion of VAP treatment with meropenem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure, who is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. He has been tolerating pressure support well and has undergone tracheostomy. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/62 mmHg to 146/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is in sinus rhythm and has shown improvement in his weight, from 110 kg at admission to 85.8 kg currently.

The patient has a history of CAD with a previous NSTEMI, but no wall motion abnormalities were seen on echo. He also has an AAA that is being monitored clinically due to his other comorbidities. Additionally, he has BPH for which a Foley catheter is in place. His WBC count is within normal range, while his Hct levels have fluctuated slightly. His platelet count has also been relatively stable. His renal function is normal, and his glucose levels have been well-controlled.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's respiratory failure is stable, and he appears to have muscular weakness contributing to his inability to pull adequate tidal volumes without pressure support and exhibiting paradoxical respiration. Recommendations include following up with neurology, planning for a bedside percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and considering a tracheostomy mask trial. Medication regimen optimization is"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, CAD with a recent NSTEMI, tracheostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and other comorbidities such as AAA and BPH.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been stable since the tracheostomy but previously failed extubation due to secretions. He appears to have muscular weakness, which may be contributing to muscle weakness and paradoxical respiration. A follow-up with Neuro recommendations is pending, and they believe he has critical illness myopathy. The plan is to start tube feeds through the tracheostomy tomorrow and trial pressure support.
2. CAD s/p NSTEMI: The patient's medication regimen has been optimized with beta-blockers, ASA, and will restart ACEI and statin. No wall motion abnormalities were seen on echo.
3. Rhythm: The patient experienced type II heart block on telemetry overnight and correlated with some hypotension to SBP 90s. A consultation for a pacemaker is being considered, and beta-blockers will be held until further evaluation.
4. Low-grade fever overnight: Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent.
5. AAA: The patient has a 3cm infra-renal AAA. In light of the patient's other comorbidities, clinical monitoring will be performed, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), myocardial infarction, and respiratory failure. Upon admission, the patient was hypotensive and tachycardic, with low oxygen saturation. The patient's troponin levels were elevated, indicating a possible heart attack. The patient was started on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and received several infusions of medications. The patient's condition has been improving, with decreasing troponin levels and stabilization of vital signs. However, the patient still requires respiratory support with CPAP/PSV and supplemental oxygen. The patient's muscle performance is impaired, and there are concerns about potential complications such as urinary tract infection (UTI) and fever. The patient's recent lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and creatinine levels. However, the patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, and his calcium level is slightly below normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's impaired balance and transfers may increase the risk of UTI. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of infection, such as fever, increased heart rate, or changes in urine output, is crucial.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of DVT increases the risk of developing another clot in"

   77 yo M w/ respiratory failure
   #Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Now s/p Trach.  Previously failed
   extubation due to secretions.  Appears to have muscular weakness as
   contributor of muscle weakness as cannot pull adequate tidal volumes
   w/o PS and has paradoxical respiration.
   -Hold on weaning pending transfer to rehab - do not want to run risk of
   another cardiac event
   - f/u Neuro recommedations no official note yet but they caleld and
   said they believe he has critical illness myopathy.
   - Had MRI per neuro to assess for other causes of weakness
   - start TF on trach tomorrow
   - continue ipratropium
   - When he can tolerate several hours off vent will consider for talk
   valve for trach.
   #CAD s/p NSTEMI, no wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.
   - Medication regimen optimized w/ BB, [**Telephone/Fax (3) **], will restart ACEI and statin
   - R/o'd by enzymes for new NSTEMI
   # Rhythm: type II heart block on telemetry overnight and seemed to
   correlate with some hypotension to SBP 90s
   -consult EP for ? of pacemaker, would need to discuss with family if he
   would want this
   # Low grade fever overnight:
   -send urine, sputum, blood cx
   # AAA:  Patient with 3cm infra-renal AAA.  In light of patient other
   co-morbidities, will clinically monitor patient.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of lung cancer who has undergone partial radiation treatment and surgical resection. He was admitted to the ICU for obtundation and failed extubation twice, complicated by a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation levels. His weight has decreased from 110 kg at admission to 85.8 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 300 mL and output of 1,200 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 900 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

Laboratory results indicate slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and hematocrit (Hct) levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 71 mg/dL and 100 mg/dL. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, appear within normal limits.

The patient's neurological examination reveals that he is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and exhibits purposeful movement with normal muscle"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- The patient underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement.
- The patient's respiratory status has improved, with improved muscle strength globally, suggesting critical illness myopathy.
- A trial of tracheostomy collar and consideration for talk valve for tracheostomy will be discussed.
- The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with no wall motion abnormalities seen on echocardiogram.
- Medication regimen optimization includes the use of aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and statin, while holding beta-blocker due to type II second-degree heart block.
- The patient experienced episodes of type II heart block and atrial fibrillation, with no plan for pacemaker given the prognosis.
- Low-grade fever was reported overnight on [**3-3**], with gram-negative rods seen on gram stain, but likely oropharyngeal contamination.
- Further investigation with sputum culture, blood culture, chest X-ray, and consideration of holding antibiotics for now will be done.
- The patient has an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) of 3cm, which will be monitored clinically without immediate intervention.
- Foley catheter in place for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) will be changed due to yeast in the urine.
- Prophylactic subcutaneous heparin and bowel regimen were administered.
- The patient has a PEG tube in place with issues related to feeding tubes.
- The patient's code status is full code, and disposition includes rehabilitation post-evaluation by cardiology, follow-up of cultures, and follow-up MRI read.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, cardiac events such as arrhythmias or myocardial infarction, infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or urinary tract infection, and complications related to the AAA."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 77-year-old male with respiratory failure who has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) but has failed extubation twice. The patient's type II heart block resolved after discontinuing beta-blocker medication. The patient experienced atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response overnight.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) with a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), no wall motion abnormalities seen on echocardiogram. Medication regimen optimization has been done, including restarting ACE inhibitors and statins. The patient has been ruled out for a new NSTEMI based on enzyme levels.

The patient's rhythm is currently atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular response, and an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ACID) is not indicated according to the electrophysiologist's assessment.

Additionally, the patient has an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 3 cm in size, which will be monitored clinically due to the patient's other comorbidities. The patient also has benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), for which a Foley catheter has been placed.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary nutrition at a rate of 50 mL/hour, regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). He also has coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), type II heart block, atrial fibrillation, a 3cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and fecal occult blood (FOB).

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/59 mmHg to 172/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on the ventilator. He is awake and following commands but unable to use a letter board to communicate. His lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and he has trace pitting edema. Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels, with slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient appears to have improved muscle strength globally, likely due to critical illness myopathy. A trial of tracheostomy collar"

","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), tracheostomy, and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement. The patient appears to have improved muscle strength globally, likely due to critical illness myopathy.

The patient has a background of coronary artery disease (CAD) post non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), with no wall motion abnormalities seen on echocardiogram. The medication regimen has been optimized with aspirin, ACE inhibitor, and statin, while beta-blockers are being held due to periods of type II second-degree heart block.

On telemetry, the patient experienced type II heart block overnight on [**3-3**] and showed periods of atrial fibrillation. The electrophysiologist does not recommend a pacemaker given the patient's prognosis.

The patient had a low-grade fever overnight on [**3-3**], but no fever in the last 48 hours. Gram-negative rods were observed on gram stain, which appears to be oropharyngeal contamination. Follow-up sputum culture, blood culture, and chest X-ray are planned. Antibiotics will be held for now, but vancomycin may be considered if the patient spikes a true fever for VAP.

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M w/ respiratory failure s/p VAP s/p trach and peg
   #Respiratory failure:  Stable.  Appears to have improved muscle
   strength globally.  Likely critical illness myopathy.
   - consider trial of trach collar
   - continue ipratropium
   - When he can tolerate several hours off vent will consider for talk
   valve for trach.
   #CAD s/p NSTEMI, no wall motion abnormalities seen on echo.
   - Medication regimen optimized w/ ASA, ACEI and statin, holding BB
   given periods of type II 2nd degree heart block.
   # Rhythm: type II heart block on telemetry overnight on [**3-3**] and seemed
   to correlate with some hypotension to SBP 90s.  Also periods of atrial
   fib.
   -EP says no plan for pacemaker given prognosis
   # Low grade fever overnight on [**3-3**]: No fever in last 48 hrs. Gram neg
   rods on gram stain but looks like oropharyngeal contamination.
   -f/u sputum cx, blood cx
   - CXR
   - Hold Abx for now, but likely vanc/[**Last Name (un) 614**] if spikes true fever for VAP
   # AAA:  Patient with 3cm infra-renal AAA.  In light of patient other
   co-morbidities, will clinically monitor patient.
   - Patient will need f/u CT as outpatient in 6 months
   BPH: Foley in place, will change today given yeast in urine

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of respiratory failure, cardiac artery disease, and a recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He is currently in the ICU and has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient has shown improvement in muscle strength, suggesting critical illness myopathy. There are concerns regarding potential medical complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), type II heart block, and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a low-grade fever overnight, and gram-negative rods were found on gram stain. However, this may be due to oropharyngeal contamination. Further investigations such as sputum culture, blood culture, and a chest X-ray are needed to confirm the diagnosis. If the patient develops a true fever, antibiotics like vancomycin should be considered.

2. Type II heart block: The patient experienced periods of type II heart block overnight, which correlated with episodes of hypotension and a blood pressure in the 90s. This may indicate a need for further cardiac evaluation, although the attending physician does not plan for a pacemaker given the patient's prognosis.

3. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA): The patient has a 3cm infra-renal AAA. Given the patient's other comorbidities, it is decided to clinically monitor"
