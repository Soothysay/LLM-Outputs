","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. She is currently stable in the ICU, being treated with heparin and supplemental oxygen. An echocardiogram showed dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle, normal global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient is also experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, which is being managed with IV morphine. Her electrolytes are replete, and she is NPO due to uncertainty of intubation/procedure. She is receiving IV heparin for prophylaxis and has peripheral lines. The patient's code status is full, and her disposition is ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right ventricular strain: The echocardiogram findings suggest right ventricular strain, which can lead to further complications if not managed properly.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The moderate pulmonary hypertension indicated by the echocardiogram could potentially worsen if not addressed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The non-occlusive DVT detected in the right distal femoral vein may progress or extend to other areas if appropriate anticoagulation and thrombosis management are not implemented.
4. Pulmonary embolism recurrence: Given the presence of diffuse pulmonary embolisms, there is a risk"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presents with acute pulmonary embolism and is currently stable on non-rebreather mask with nasal cannula. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/66 mmHg to 158/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 inspirations per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has a mild decrease in platelet count and elevated creatinine levels. An echo showed dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle, normal global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation: The patient already has moderate pulmonary hypertension, which may worsen if not managed properly.
2. Right ventricular strain: The echo showed a dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle, indicating potential strain on the right side of the heart. This could lead to further complications if not addressed.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a non-occlusive DVT in the right distal femoral vein. This increases the risk of developing more DVTs or pulmonary embolisms if not appropriately managed.
4. Bleeding: Due to the use"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. She is currently stable on non-rebreather mask with nasal cannula, with stable blood pressure and pulse. The patient underwent imaging which revealed diffuse pulmonary embolisms with minimal lung perfusion. An echocardiogram showed a dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle, normal global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. The patient's PTT levels have been difficult to achieve. She has been receiving heparin infusion and supplemental oxygen. Pain control is being managed with IV morphine, and further recommendations regarding anticoagulation are being sought due to the risk of bleeding into the dural sac. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is currently NPO. Prophylactic IV heparin is being administered. The patient's code status has been discussed with her and her husband. She is currently in the ICU pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right ventricular strain: The echocardiogram findings indicate a dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle, which can lead to right ventricular strain and potentially worsen the patient's condition.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: Moderate pulmonary hypertension is present, which may contribute to increased strain on the right ventricle and further complications"

   Echo:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free
   wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle. Normal
   global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate
   functional tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**]
   who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism/hypoxia: Per reports from OSH, and per discussion
   with radiologists at [**Hospital1 5**] and review of the images, pt has diffuse
   PE's bilaterally, with very little lung perfusion. Pt is currently
   stable on NRB with NC, with stable BP and pulse.
   - Discussed case with IR/angio; the angio team will review records,
   but are reluctant to persue thrombectomy while pt HD stable
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Change to [**Hospital1 **] PTTs (has now had two therapeutic PTTs).
   - Continue supplemental O2 with NRB
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN nebs
   - Continue to wean off face mask (current FiO2 at 80%) to nasal canula
   # S/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain
   in abdomen, low back.
   - Pain control with IV morphine for now, anticipate change to PO meds
   if pt does not require procedure or intubation today
   - Ortho following, appreciate recommendations about anticoagulation
   given risk of bleeding into dural sac with IV heparin
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: IV heparin
   # Access: peripherals
   # Communication: Patient, family
   # Code:  Full (discussed with patient); HCP husband [**Name (NI) 938**] [**Name (NI) 3033**]

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presents with an acute pulmonary embolism. She is currently in the ICU, stable on NRB with NC, with stable blood pressure and pulse. The patient has been given zyprexa and morphine for anxiety and pain management. Her pain levels range from 9-15 on a scale of 0-10. She has diminished breath sounds in her chest and trace edema in her lower extremities. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged PTT and elevated INR. An echocardiogram reveals a dilated right ventricle, normal left ventricular function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary hypertension exacerbation due to ongoing pulmonary embolism.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and risk factors.
3. Nosocomial pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation.
4. Delirium or agitation due to medications such as zyprexa.
5. Worsening of right ventricular function leading to cardiac failure.
6. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing bleeding or clotting disorders.
7. Pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged imm"

   fusion on [**2172-4-7**] who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
   24 Hour Events:
   Taking a while for PTT to get therapeutic but tonight is over 90. Was
   quite anxious and asking for PCA which was not given. Per nursing she
   was very dramatic and anxious overnight. Eventually given zyprexa and
   morphine but no benzos.
   This morning she has no new complaints. Still complaining of back pain
   from her surgery and some unclear pain more anteriorly that she says is
   from her lungs but is not worse than prior. Pain overall is [**9-15**].

   Echo:
   The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness,
   cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF
   >55%). The right ventricular cavity is dilated with mild global free
   wall hypokinesis. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be
   determined. There is no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
   mitral regurgitation. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen.
   There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated and mildly hypokinetic right ventricle. Normal
   global and regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Moderate
   functional tricuspid regurgitation. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**]
   who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism/hypoxia: Per reports from OSH, and per discussion
   with radiologists at [**Hospital1 5**] and review of the images, pt has diffuse
   PE's bilaterally, with very little lung perfusion. Pt is currently
   stable on NRB with NC, with stable BP and pulse.
   - Discussed case with IR/angio; the angio team will review records,
   but are reluctant to persue thrombectomy while pt HD stable
   - Continue heparin gtt
   - Change to [**Hospital1 **] PTTs (has now had two therapeutic PTTs).
   - Continue supplemental O2 with NRB
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN nebs
   - Continue to wean off face mask (current FiO2 at 80%) to nasal canula
   # S/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain
   in abdomen, low back.
   - Pain control with IV morphine for now, anticipate change to PO meds
   if pt does not require procedure or intubation today
   - Ortho following, appreciate recommendations about anticoagulation
   given risk of bleeding into dural sac with IV heparin
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: IV heparin

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
- The patient has been anxious and dramatic overnight, but no new complaints this morning.
- She complains of back pain from her surgery and some unclear pain more anteriorly that she says is from her lungs, but it is not worse than prior.
- The patient has been given Zyprexa and morphine but no benzodiazepines.
- Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory symptoms.
- Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/74 mmHg to 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- Physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/anxious patient with distant heart sounds, diminished breath sounds on the chest, soft non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities.
- Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal glucose levels, and abnormal coagulation profiles with prolonged PTT.
- An echocardiogram reveals a dilated right ventricle with mild hypokinesis, normal left ventricular systolic function, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- Assessment and plan include treating acute pulmonary embolism"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presents with acute pulmonary embolism. She is currently in the ICU and is stable on NRB with NC, with stable blood pressure and pulse. Her pain from the laminectomy is still present, and she is receiving IV morphine for pain control. The patient has a trace of right lower extremity edema and left lower extremity edema. Her labs show elevated D-dimer levels, normal white blood cell count, and mildly decreased platelet count. Her PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, indicating a possible coagulopathy. An echocardiogram reveals a mildly dilated left atrium, normal left ventricular wall thickness and cavity size, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (>55%), a dilated right ventricular cavity with mild global free wall hypokinesis, moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, moderate functional tricuspid regurgitation, and no aortic valve stenosis or regurgitation. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is receiving heparin for anticoagulation. She is also receiving supplemental oxygen, albuterol, and ipratropium as needed. Pain control measures are in place, and the patient is being monitored closely for any changes in her condition. Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening pulmonary hypertension, development of further clot formation due to inadequate anticoagulation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presents with acute pulmonary embolism. The patient's pain levels range from 9-15, with complaints of back pain from surgery and anterior chest pain that she attributes to her lungs. She has a known allergy to Ambien. The patient is currently on heparin infusion and receiving morphine sulfate for pain management. Review of systems remains unchanged except for respiratory symptoms such as cough and dyspnea. Vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8 C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 94/74 to 152/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus rhythm with no acute distress. The patient is well-nourished but anxious. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds in the chest, trace edema in both lower extremities, and soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Neurologic assessment is not performed due to patient's anxiety and agitation. Laboratory results show elevated D-dimer levels at 392 K/uL and normal white blood cell count. The patient's PT/PTT/INR levels are elevated, with a PTT over 90. Imaging studies are pending. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of pain, agitation, and potential complications related to her pulmonary embol"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**]
   who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism/hypoxia:, Pt has diffuse PE's bilaterally, with
   very little lung perfusion. Due to HD stability, no TPA/thrombectomy
   was pursued.  Pt is currently stable on NC, at times requires face
   mask, with stable BP and pulse.   Sats 92% on 5 L, desats to 88% when
   talking.  PTT has been very labile, became therapeutic, but then
   increased to >100.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. She has diffuse pulmonary embolisms bilaterally with very little lung perfusion. The patient is currently stable on nasal cannula oxygen at times requiring a face mask, with stable blood pressure and pulse. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on 5 liters nasal cannula, desatting to 88% when talking. The patient's PTT has been labile, became therapeutic, but then increased to over 100.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has diffuse pulmonary embolisms bilaterally, which can lead to further clot formation, hypoxia, and respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is on heparin, an anticoagulant medication, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Pain management: The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back after laminectomy, and there is a need for effective pain management.
4. Constipation: The patient is experiencing constipation and bloating, which needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
5. Weaning off oxygen: The patient is currently on 5 liters nasal cannula oxygen and needs to be weaned off gradually to minimize the risk of respiratory complications.
6. Anticoagulation management: The patient requires careful monitoring and management of anticoag"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. The patient has diffuse pulmonary emboli bilaterally with very little lung perfusion. Due to hemodynamic stability, no thrombolytic therapy or thrombectomy was pursued. The patient is currently stable on nasal cannula, requiring face mask at times, with stable blood pressure and pulse. Oxygen saturation is 92% on 5 liters nasal cannula, desaturating to 88% when talking. Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) values have been labile, becoming therapeutic but then increasing to over 100.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has acute pulmonary embolism with diffuse PE's bilaterally. This condition can lead to further clot formation, pulmonary hypertension, and respiratory distress.
2. Bleeding complications: Due to the use of heparin, there is a risk of bleeding complications such as hemorrhage or bruising.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low (372 K/uL), which may increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is currently at 92% on 5 liters nasal cannula, indicating potential hypoxia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presents with acute pulmonary embolism and has diffuse PE's bilaterally with very little lung perfusion. The patient's PTT has been labile, but is currently stable on NC, requiring face mask at times, with stable BP and pulse. Her oxygen saturation is 92% on 5 L, desatting to 88% when talking. 

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism: The patient has been diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, which is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by blood clots in the lungs. The patient's symptoms include diffuse PE's bilaterally and very little lung perfusion.

2. Hypoxia: The patient's oxygen saturation is 92% on 5 L, desatting to 88% when talking. This indicates that the patient is not receiving enough oxygen, which can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.

3. Unstable Coagulation: The patient's PTT has been labile, becoming therapeutic but then increasing to >100. This suggests an unstable coagulation status, indicating a risk of bleeding or clotting disorders.

4. Pain Management: The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back following a laminectomy. The transition to PO pain meds is planned, but the patient may require a pain consult if the medication regimen is ineffective."

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presents with acute pulmonary embolism and is currently stable on NC (nasal cannula) with supplemental oxygen. Her PTT has been labile, becoming therapeutic but then increasing to over 100. The patient is also experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, which is likely related to her recent laminectomy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient's acute pulmonary embolism could lead to further complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, or even a massive pulmonary embolism causing sudden cardiovascular collapse.
2. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving IV heparin, which increases the risk of bleeding. Since she is also planned to start on coumadin, there is a higher risk of bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been fluctuating, with values ranging from 372 K/uL to 398 K/uL. This could be indicative of thrombocytopenia, which can increase the risk of bleeding.
4. Pain management: The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, which may affect her comfort and could potentially lead to complications if not adequately managed.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's electrolyte levels, particularly potassium (K+"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) and hypoxemia. She underwent a lumbar laminectomy two weeks prior to admission. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been on heparin infusion to prevent further clotting. Her oxygen levels are being weaned down. She also underwent laminectomy surgery and is transitioning to oral pain control. Other issues are being managed by the ICU team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient's history of bilateral PEs indicates a predisposition to blood clot formation. It is crucial to monitor for signs of DVT, which may include swelling, pain, and redness in the legs.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Recurrent PEs can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing pulmonary hypertension. This can result in right ventricular strain and potentially lead to heart failure.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's initial presentation included hypoxemia, which refers to low oxygen levels in the blood. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and providing appropriate respiratory support are essential to prevent further respiratory complications.
4. Bleeding complications: Due to the anticoagulation therapy with heparin and Coumadin, there is a risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring of clotting parameters, such as PT/INR, is necessary to ensure therapeutic antico"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presents with acute pulmonary embolism and is currently in the ICU. The patient has been stable on nasal cannula with oxygen, but desaturates with movement or getting out of bed. She experiences shortness of breath during these activities.

The patient has undergone laminectomy and is experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back. The incision is healing well, but she needs to transition to oral pain medications. Ortho recommends AP/Lateral L-spine films during this admission once stable to go to radiology.

The patient also has constipation and has been written for colace and senna PRN. It is recommended to write for standing colace and senna, as well as Dulcolax today.

In terms of medical complications that can arise, the patient's acute pulmonary embolism puts her at risk for further clot formation and potential embolization. Monitoring PTT levels and continuing heparin drip on a weight-based protocol will help manage this condition. Additionally, bridging with Coumadin is recommended.

The patient's recent spinal fusion surgery may lead to complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Prophylaxis for DVT and VTE is necessary, which includes anticoagulation therapy.

The patient's gastric bypass surgery may contribute to nutritional deficiencies,"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU with bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs), hypoxemia, and a recent history of lumbar laminectomy. She is currently being treated with heparin and awaiting therapeutic levels of Coumadin. The patient's oxygen saturation levels decrease with movement, indicating ongoing hypoxemia. Plans include weaning off oxygen and obtaining plain films of the l-spine later this week. The patient's other medical issues are being managed by the ICU team. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has developed bilateral PEs, which are secondary to DVTs. It is crucial to continue systemic anticoagulation with heparin to prevent further clot formation.
2. Pulmonary Hypertension: Repeated episodes of PE can lead to pulmonary hypertension, a long-term complication that can cause right heart strain and failure.
3. Recurrent PEs: Despite anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of recurrent PEs due to the underlying hypercoagulable state or other contributing factors.
4. Respiratory Failure: Severe hypoxemia and potential further deterioration in lung function may lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation support.
5. Right Heart Strain/Failure: Frequent and significant PEs can result in strain on the right side of the heart, potentially leading"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presents with acute pulmonary embolism and is currently stable on nasal cannula at times requiring face mask, with stable blood pressure and pulse. The patient experienced desaturations while sleeping and with any effort, so FiO2 was increased from 35% to 70%, then weaned back to 50% and now back on 35%. The patient is tearful and overwhelmed, complaining of back pain and feeling very emotional. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has diffuse pulmonary embolisms bilaterally with very little lung perfusion. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential complications such as hypoxia or even respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobilization and the presence of multiple central lines. Prophylactic measures such as heparin infusion should be continued to prevent clot formation.
3. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient's PTT has been very labile and became supratherapeutic overnight. Close monitoring of the PTT is necessary to prevent HIT, a potentially serious complication of heparin therapy.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but close monitoring is required to detect any drops in"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman who underwent a lumbar laminectomy two weeks prior to admission and was diagnosed with large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs). She also has a history of depression, activity intolerance, and a recent episode of desaturation while sleeping. 

The patient is currently receiving heparin intravenously at a rate of 2,950 units per hour, which is above the therapeutic range. The goal is to adjust the dosage according to protocol. She is also on Coumadin, awaiting for her International Normalized Ratio (INR) to become therapeutic. 

Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 127/70 to 138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery device. 

Her physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion with clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no lower extremity edema. Neurological examination is not assessed at this time.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, leukocyte count of 401 K/uL, platelet count of 401 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL, glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and other electrolyte levels within normal range.

The patient's recent arterial blood gas (ABG) readings indicate a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) of 26 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) of 102 mmHg.

The patient's plan includes continuing systemic anticoagulation with heparin, monitoring her INR levels for therapeutic dosing of Coumadin, and obtaining plain films of the L-spine later this week. She will continue to receive pain medications and undergo a social work consult.

Potential medical complications that can arise include further episodes of desaturation or hypoxemia, bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy, and potential complications related to her previous laminectomy procedure."

   who presents with acute pulmonary embolism.
   # Pulmonary embolism/hypoxia:, Pt has diffuse PE's bilaterally, with
   very little lung perfusion. Due to HD stability, no TPA/thrombectomy
   was pursued.  Pt is currently stable on face mask, with stable BP and
   pulse.   Sats 95% on 35% face mask.  PTT has been very labile, became
   therapeutic yesterday.  Desats while sleeping and any effort.
   - Continue heparin gtt on weight based protocol.
   - Continue to follow PTTs  q6h
   - Bridging with Coumadin 5mg PO Qhs
   - Albuterol and Ipratropium PRN nebs
   - Continue to wean oxygen (currently 35% FM).
   # S/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain
   in abdomen, low back.
   - Continue pain meds PO.
   - Ortho following and they recommend AP/Lateral L-spine films during
   this admission once stable to go to radiology
   - Touch base with ortho re patient sensation of lying on a plate

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. She has diffuse pulmonary embolisms bilaterally and is currently stable on a face mask with a saturation level of 95% on 35% face mask. Her blood pressure and pulse are stable, and her PTT has become therapeutic. The patient is on heparin infusion and will continue to follow PTT levels every six hours. She is also bridging with Coumadin 5mg PO Qhs. Albuterol and ipratropium nebs are provided as needed. Oxygen therapy is being weaned, currently at 35% face mask. The patient's midline incision from laminectomy is healing well, but she still experiences pain in her abdomen and low back. Pain medication will be continued, and ortho follow-up is recommended with AP/Lateral L-spine films during admission once stable. The patient has constipation and will continue with colace/senna and dulcolax as needed. She is maintained on home medications for depression/anxiety, specifically Effexor and Seroquel. She has become increasingly tearful and overwhelmed due to her son's issues. Social work recommendations are appreciated. The patient's pain is well-controlled on PO medications, so oxycontin and oxycodone will be continued. FEN (nothing by mouth), replete electrolytes, and regular diet will be maintained. Prophylaxis with IV heparin will continue. Peripheral access includes an 18-gauge line placed on [**2172-4-23**] 08:31 AM and a 20-gauge line placed on [**2172-4-26**] 02:00 PM. Communication with the patient and family is important. Code status is full and discussed with the patient, with HCP husband [**Name (NI) 938**] and [**Name (NI) 3033**] listed as contacts. Disposition will be discussed with the floor today."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. The patient is currently stable on a face mask, with a saturation level of 95% on 35% face mask. The patient's blood pressure and pulse are stable. The PTT has become therapeutic. The patient's midline incision from laminectomy is healing well, but she is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back. The patient is also experiencing constipation and is maintained on home medications for depression and anxiety. Pain is well-controlled on PO meds. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. The patient is receiving prophylaxis with IV heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has diffuse PE's bilaterally, indicating a potential risk for further clot formation and potential complications such as recurrent embolism or pulmonary hypertension.
2. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient is receiving heparin therapy, which carries a risk of developing HIT, a condition where the body develops antibodies against heparin, leading to low platelet counts and increased risk of bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's midline incision from laminectomy is healing well, but there is still a risk of infection at the surgical site.
4. Constipation: The patient's recent"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with acute pulmonary embolism. She is currently stable on nasal cannula at times requiring a face mask, with stable blood pressure and pulse. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on 35% face mask. The patient's PTT has been very labile and became supratherapeutic overnight. She desats while sleeping and with any effort. 

The patient is being managed with weight-based heparin infusion, monitoring of PTTs every 6 hours, bridging with Coumadin 5mg PO Qhs, use of albuterol and ipratropium nebs as needed, and weaning of oxygen.

The patient also has a midline incision from a recent laminectomy that is healing well, but she is still experiencing pain in her abdomen and low back. She is receiving pain medication orally and orthopedic follow-up is recommended with AP/Lateral L-spine films during this admission once stable.

The patient is experiencing constipation and depression/anxiety. She is maintained on home medications for depression and anxiety, but has become increasingly tearful and feels overwhelmed. A social work consult is recommended.

The patient's pain control has been restarted with oxycodone IR on top of oxycontin. She is also receiving prophylaxis with IV heparin and has peripheral access with an 18-gauge line placed on 04/23/2172 and a 20-gauge line placed on 04/26/2172. Communication with the patient and family has been established, and code status and disposition have been discussed and documented."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She was admitted to the MICU due to bilateral pulmonary emboli and subsequently returned after becoming hypotensive. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 125/69 mmHg, heart rate of 70 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for some discomfort with cough. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary emboli: The patient presented with diffuse pulmonary emboli, which can lead to respiratory distress and decreased oxygenation. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory support, if needed, should be continued.
2. Pneumonia: There is a possible pneumonia indicated on the CT scan, which may require continued antibiotic therapy. The patient is currently receiving Vancomycin and Cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level is within her recent baseline after surgery. It is important to monitor the Hct levels and continue with cyanocobalamin and multivitamin supplementation.
4. Anxiety: The patient is on medications for anxiety, including venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine. Social work has also been involved in the patient's care.
5. FEN (Fluid, Electrolyte, and Nutrition): The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. No IV fluids are required at this time.
6. Prophylaxis: The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. Additionally, she is on pain control measures as previously mentioned.
7. Access: The patient has peripheral lines for medication administration.
8. Communication: The patient and her family are being kept informed about her condition and treatment plan.

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable with ongoing management of her pulmonary emboli, pneumonia, anemia, anxiety, and prophylactic measures. Close monitoring and continued treatment are necessary."

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was started on heparin and later transitioned to Coumadin for anticoagulation. The patient initially required nonrebreather face mask but was later able to maintain oxygen saturation with nasal cannula. Her INR and PTT are now therapeutic. 

The patient is currently being treated for possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with Vancomycin and cefepime, as the CT scan shows an infiltrate that could represent inflammation or infarction due to the pulmonary emboli. 

The patient had a laminectomy and is experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back. Ortho is following along, and she will continue her pain control regimen of oxycontin, oxycodone, and tizanidine. 

Her hemoglobin (Hct) is within her recent baseline after surgery, so no active evidence of bleeding. She will continue with cyanocobalamin and multivitamin supplementation. 

The patient is also being treated for anxiety with venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine. Social work has seen the patient. 

There are no IV fluids, and her electrolytes are regular. She is on a regular diet. 

Prophylaxis measures include heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli and was admitted to the MICU. She required oxygen supplementation initially but was later weaned down to 4L NC. Her INR and PTT are now therapeutic. She is on coumadin 5 mg qD, but the dose will be decreased to 3mg QD tomorrow.

The patient has a possible pneumonia on CT scan, but the infiltrate may represent inflammation/infarction from PE. Vancomycin and cefepime were discontinued because it is unlikely that she has pneumonia.

The patient had a laminectomy and her midline incision is healing well. She is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back. Ortho is following along, and the left back pain may be due to a small splenic infarct seen on chest CT. She will continue her home pain control regimen and encourage increased use of PRNs. A pain consult will be obtained since the pain is ongoing and does not seem to be well-controlled on the current regimen. Ortho is requesting AP & lateral L-spine x-rays prior to discharge.

The patient's hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. She will continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. There is no active evidence of bleeding, and her hct will be monitored.

The patient continues to complain of some discomfort with cough"

   who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli was called out to the
   floor but returned to the MICU yesterday afternoon after becoming
   hypotensive
   .
   # Pulmonary emboli: She presented with diffuse PE's bilaterally and was
   started on heparin gtt. Patient did have signs of R heart strain on TTE
   but was never hemodynamically unstable. She did not require lysis. She
   initially required NRB face mask to maintain oxygen saturations but
   overtime was titrated down to 4L NC. Her INR and PTT are both now
   therapeutic.
   - On coumadin 5 mg qD; supratherapeutic today, will hold today and
   decrease dose tomorrow to 3mg QD.
   - D/c echo for now as unlikely to change management given known PE
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - PT consult, f/u
   - nebs PRN wheezing, SOB
   .
   # Pneumonia- Possible PNA on CT scan, however, infiltrate may represent
   inflammation/infarction from PE
   - D/C Vanco/Cefepime because unlikely to have pneumonia
   .
   # S/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt still having pain
   in abdomen, low back. Ortho is following along.  Left back pain perhaps
   due to small splenic infarct seen on chest CT.
   - will continue home pain control regimen of oxycontin 20q12, oxycodone
   and tizanidine
   - Encourage increased use of PRNs; she is not taking consistently
   - Since pain is ongoing issue and does not seem to be well-controlled
   on current regimen, will obtain pain consult
   - ortho requesting AP & lateral L-spine x-rays prior to d/c
   .
   # Anemia: Her hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. Will
   continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. No active evidence of
   bleeding.
   - monitor hct
   .
   # Anxiety: Will continue venlafaxine, clonazepam, quetiapine. Social
   work has seen patient.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   .
   # Prophylaxis: heparin, bowel regimen, pain control as above

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion, presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was treated with heparin and did not require thrombolytic therapy. The patient's INR and PTT levels are now therapeutic, and she is on coumadin 5 mg qD. Her oxygen saturation has been maintained with a nasal cannula. A CT scan revealed a small splenic infarct, and the patient also has ground glass opacities in the left upper lung, which may represent infectious etiology, asymmetric ventilation from pulmonary embolus, or foci of hemorrhage. New small left greater than right pleural effusions were also observed. The patient's labs show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. However, her creatinine levels are slightly elevated. The patient's pain in the abdomen and low back is ongoing, and she is currently on a pain control regimen. A pain consult has been obtained, and the ortho department is following up with the patient. The patient's anxiety medications will continue, and social work has seen the patient. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. Prophylactic measures include heparin, bowel regimen, and pain control. The patient's code status is full code, and she will remain in the ICU until her pain is controlled and for potential callout tomorrow."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of large bilateral pulmonary embolisms (PEs) occurring two weeks after a lumbar laminectomy. She was admitted to the ICU due to an episode of tachypnea and hypoxemia yesterday. Her current chief complaints are pleuritic chest pain and back pain, which have improved this morning.

The patient has been diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia, as indicated by new left upper lobe infiltrate and a left-sided effusion seen on a computed tomography angiogram (CTA). There is also a small splenic infarct noted. Her allergies include Ambien (oral), and she has a history of headache.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/66 mmHg to 144/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on a nasal cannula. She is currently on sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.5 to 8.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count ranging from 372 to 404 K/uL, blood glucose levels between 87 mg/dL and 137 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances such as potassium levels between"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. The patient did well overnight but desaturates with activity. The patient has allergies to Ambien and has been receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime and vancomycin.

The vital signs show a temperature of 35.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/52 to 138/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 89.3 kg, and their height is 64 inches. The fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,160 mL and a total output of 1,400 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes the use of a nasal cannula and supplemental oxygen. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results are not provided in the note, but the oxygen saturation is reported as 97%.

The physical examination findings are limited due to the patient not being assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic, and other systems.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, normal platelet count (Plt), and abnormal creatinine (Cr) levels. Other lab values, including glucose, electrolytes, liver function tests (LFTs), and kidney function tests, are within normal ranges or do not show significant fluctuations"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of obesity, s/p gastric bypass, s/p L5/S1 laminectomy
   who presented with large bilateral PEs.  Was called out of MICU
   yesterday and returning for continued hypoxia and worsening pain.
   .
   # Pulmonary emboli: were diffuse, never hemodynamically unstable.  On
   repeat CT, she continues to have extensive clot burden.  Is requiring
   fask mask oxygen and has been slow to wean.  Desats on the floor,
   likely from exertion and movement.  Will be transferred back to unit
   for continued respiratory monitoring.
   - continue coumadin; can continue to hold heparin
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - nebs PRN wheezing, SOB
   .
   # LUL infiltrate: concerning for pneumonia.  [**Month (only) 8**] have contributed to
   her desaturations on the floor.  Is not febrile and no leukocytosis,
   but may be early.
   - vanco/cefepime for HAP coverage
   - repeat CXR tomorrow
   .
   # Back pain: unclear etiology, no bleeding seen on CT scan today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of obesity, who underwent gastric bypass surgery and L5/S1 laminectomy. She presented with large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs), but was never hemodynamically unstable. The patient continues to have extensive clot burden and requires supplemental oxygen. She has been slow to wean from the ventilator and desaturates on the floor, likely due to exertion and movement. She will be transferred back to the ICU for continued respiratory monitoring.

Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary emboli: The patient has extensive clot burden and requires respiratory monitoring. There is a risk of further clot formation and potential complications such as hypoxia, respiratory distress, and pulmonary hypertension.
2. Left upper lobe (LUL) infiltrate: The patient may have developed pneumonia, which could contribute to her desaturations on the floor. This requires prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis.
3. Back pain: The etiology of the patient's back pain is unclear, but it could be due to post-operative pain, pain from lying in bed, or pleuretic pain from the PEs and new pneumonia. Pain control measures should be continued, and further evaluation by orthopedics is recommended.
4. S/p laminectomy: The patient's midline incision is healing well, but she is still experiencing pain. Orthopedics is following up with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of obesity, who underwent gastric bypass surgery and L5/S1 laminectomy. She presented with large bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and was initially admitted to the MICU. She was transferred back to the ICU due to continued hypoxia and worsening pain. The patient has extensive clot burden and requires oxygen supplementation. She also has a left upper lobe infiltrate, which is concerning for pneumonia. The patient's back pain etiology is unclear, but it is likely due to post-operative pain or pain from lying in bed. Her abdominal incision is healing well, but she still experiences pain in her abdomen and low back. The patient has anemia, which is within her recent baseline after surgery. She will continue receiving cyanocobalamin and multivitamin supplementation. The patient is also experiencing anxiety and will continue with venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine. The patient's electrolytes are replete, and she is on a regular diet. She is on prophylaxis with coumadin, bowel regimen, and pain control. Peripheral IV access is planned for antibiotic administration and blood draws. The patient has a full code status and is being discussed with the healthcare proxy. She will be called out to the floor for disposition.

   who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli was called out to the
   floor but returned to the MICU yesterday afternoon after becoming
   hypotensive
   # Pulmonary emboli: She presented with diffuse PE's bilaterally and was
   started on heparin gtt. Patient did have signs of R heart strain on TTE
   but was never hemodynamically unstable. She did not require lysis. She
   initially required NRB face mask to maintain oxygen saturations but
   overtime was titrated down to 4L NC. Her INR and PTT are both now
   therapeutic.
   - coumadin 4 mg today; continue to check INR daily
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - PT consulted
   - nebs PRN wheezing, SOB
   # Pneumonia- Possible PNA on CT scan, however, infiltrate may represent
   inflammation/infarction from PE. Stopped Vanco/Cefepime yesterday
   because unlikely to have pneumonia.
   # Pain Management s/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt
   still having pain in abdomen, low back. Ortho is following along.  Left
   back pain perhaps due to small splenic infarct seen on chest CT.
   - pain service consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue tizanidine, increase Gabapentin to 400 q8
   - stop prn morphine
   - plan to stagger sedating/pain meds to avoid stacking
   - ordered follow up spine films (per ortho request: AP & lateral
   L-spine x-rays)
   - will continue home pain control regimen of oxycontin 20q12, oxycodone
   and tizanidine
   - Encourage increased use of PRNs; she is not taking consistently
   # Anemia: Her hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. Will
   continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. No active evidence of
   bleeding.
   - monitor hct
   # Anxiety: Will continue venlafaxine, clonazepam, quetiapine. Social
   work has seen patient. Stagger sedating meds to avoid stacking.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion. She presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli (PEs) and was initially treated on the floor but returned to the MICU after becoming hypotensive. 

The patient was started on heparin and required supplemental oxygen, which was gradually weaned down. Her INR and PTT are now therapeutic, and she is receiving warfarin. 

There is a mention of possible pneumonia on the CT scan; however, it could also represent inflammation or infarction from the PE. Antibiotics were stopped due to the uncertainty of pneumonia. 

The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, which is being managed by pain service. Gabapentin has been increased to 400 mg q8, and the plan is to continue home pain control regimen. 

The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is within her recent baseline after surgery. Anemia is not actively present, and she will continue to receive cyanocobalamin and multivitamins. 

The patient is also being treated for anxiety and is on venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine. 

Overall, the patient's condition appears stable, and she is ready for transfer to the floor with continued therapeutic anticoagulation and pain management."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**]
   who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli was called out to the
   floor but returned to the MICU yesterday afternoon after becoming
   hypotensive
   # Pulmonary emboli: She presented with diffuse PE's bilaterally and was
   started on heparin gtt. Patient did have signs of R heart strain on TTE
   but was never hemodynamically unstable. She did not require lysis. She
   initially required NRB face mask to maintain oxygen saturations but
   overtime was titrated down to 4L NC. Her INR and PTT are both now
   therapeutic.
   - On coumadin 5 mg qD; supratherapeutic today, will hold today and
   decrease dose tomorrow to 3mg QD.
   - D/c echo for now as unlikely to change management given known PE
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - PT consulted
   - nebs PRN wheezing, SOB
   # Pneumonia- Possible PNA on CT scan, however, infiltrate may represent
   inflammation/infarction from PE. Stopped Vanco/Cefepime yesterday
   because unlikely to have pneumonia.
   # Pain Management s/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt
   still having pain in abdomen, low back. Ortho is following along.  Left
   back pain perhaps due to small splenic infarct seen on chest CT.
   - pain service consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue tizanidine, increase Gabapentin to 400 q8
   - stop prn morphine
   - plan to stagger sedating/pain meds to avoid stacking
   - ordered follow up spine films (per ortho request: AP & lateral
   L-spine x-rays)
   - will continue home pain control regimen of oxycontin 20q12, oxycodone
   and tizanidine
   - Encourage increased use of PRNs; she is not taking consistently
   # Anemia: Her hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. Will
   continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. No active evidence of
   bleeding.
   - monitor hct
   # Anxiety: Will continue venlafaxine, clonazepam, quetiapine. Social
   work has seen patient. Stagger sedating meds to avoid stacking.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin, bowel regimen, pain control as above

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was started on heparin and her INR and PTT are now therapeutic. She is currently on Coumadin 5 mg qD but will have the dose decreased to 3 mg qD tomorrow. She is weaning off oxygen and nebs are given as needed for wheezing and shortness of breath. The patient also has possible pneumonia, but the decision was made to stop Vancomycin and Cefepime because it is unlikely that she has pneumonia. The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, which is being managed by pain service. The plan is to continue with tizanidine and increase Gabapentin to 400 mg q8h. Prn morphine is being discontinued and there will be a staggered schedule for sedating/pain medications to avoid stacking. Follow-up spine films are ordered. The patient's hemoglobin level is within her recent baseline after surgery, so no active evidence of bleeding is present. Anemia is being monitored and cyanocobalamin and multivitamin are being continued. The patient is also being treated for anxiety with venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine. She is being monitored for fluid electrolyte balance and regular diet. Prophylaxis measures include heparin, bowel regimen, and pain control. Access is"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 y/o F with hx of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion on [**2172-4-7**]
   who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli was called out to the
   floor but returned to the MICU yesterday afternoon after becoming
   hypotensive
   # Pulmonary emboli: She presented with diffuse PE's bilaterally and was
   started on heparin gtt. Patient did have signs of R heart strain on TTE
   but was never hemodynamically unstable. She did not require lysis. She
   initially required NRB face mask to maintain oxygen saturations but
   overtime was titrated down to 4L NC. Her INR and PTT are both now
   therapeutic.
   - coumadin 4 mg today; continue to check INR daily
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - PT consulted
   - nebs PRN wheezing, SOB
   # Pneumonia- Possible PNA on CT scan, however, infiltrate may represent
   inflammation/infarction from PE. Stopped Vanco/Cefepime yesterday
   because unlikely to have pneumonia.
   # Pain Management s/p laminectomy: Midline incision healing well, pt
   still having pain in abdomen, low back. Ortho is following along.  Left
   back pain perhaps due to small splenic infarct seen on chest CT.
   - pain service consulted, appreciate recs
   - continue tizanidine, increase Gabapentin to 400 q8
   - stop prn morphine
   - plan to stagger sedating/pain meds to avoid stacking
   - ordered follow up spine films (per ortho request: AP & lateral
   L-spine x-rays)
   - will continue home pain control regimen of oxycontin 20q12, oxycodone
   and tizanidine
   - Encourage increased use of PRNs; she is not taking consistently
   # Anemia: Her hct is within her recent baseline after surgery. Will
   continue cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. No active evidence of
   bleeding.
   - monitor hct
   # Anxiety: Will continue venlafaxine, clonazepam, quetiapine. Social
   work has seen patient. Stagger sedating meds to avoid stacking.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, regular diet
   # Prophylaxis: heparin, bowel regimen, pain control as above
   # Access: 20 Gauge - [**2172-4-30**] 03:00 PM
   # Communication: Patient and husband
   # Code: Full (discussed with patient); HCP husband [**Name (NI) 938**] [**Name (NI) 3033**]
   # Disposition: Call out to floor
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of gastric bypass and recent spinal fusion who presented with bilateral pulmonary emboli. She was started on heparin and required oxygen supplementation initially but was weaned down to nasal cannula. Her INR and PTT are now therapeutic. She has been diagnosed with possible pneumonia, but the infiltrate may be due to inflammation/infarction from the PE. Antibiotics were stopped yesterday as it is unlikely to be pneumonia. The patient is still experiencing pain in the abdomen and low back, with left back pain possibly due to a small splenic infarct seen on chest CT. Pain service was consulted, and recommendations include continuing tizanidine, increasing Gabapentin to 400 mg every 8 hours, stopping prn morphine, and staggering sedating/pain medications to avoid stacking. Follow-up spine films were ordered as per ortho request. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (hct) is within her recent baseline after surgery, and she will continue receiving cyanocobalamin and multivitamin. There is no active evidence of bleeding, and her electrolytes are regular. She is encouraged to take PRN medications consistently. She will continue on venlafaxine, clonazepam, and quetiapine for anxiety. Her fluid balance is positive with a total intake of 1,160 mL and output of 1,400 mL. Her vital signs are stable, with a"
