","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis but her course was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise due to her current condition and past medical history. These include:

1. GI bleed: The patient has evidence of bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, which has been treated with epinephrine injection and cauterization. There is a need for ongoing monitoring of her hemoglobin levels and continued management of her GI bleed.

2. Right-sided failure: The patient has severe right-sided heart failure likely secondary to moderate 3+ tricuspid regurgitation (TR). This may lead to worsening fluid balance and pulmonary edema if not managed appropriately.

3. Coronary artery disease (CAD): Although there is no evidence of CAD on catheterization, the patient's history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation put her at risk for CAD. Long-term management and monitoring for cardiovascular events may be necessary.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled, but she is not currently anticoagulated due to concerns about her alcohol abuse history. Monitoring her coagulation status and considering anticoagulation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- A 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation admitted for diuresis.
- The patient's course was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer.
- She underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), which revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb. She received an epinephrine injection and cauterization.
- The patient continues to produce large volumes of blood through the nasogastric tube (NGT) and in her stool.
- Serial hematocrit (Hct) levels were obtained, and the decision to rescope will be made based on the morning Hct value.
- The patient has three peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines, one of which is an 18-gauge extension set.
- She is receiving intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has been typed and crossed for blood, with a threshold for transfusion set at 30.
- Consent for blood transfusion has been obtained, and Helicobacter pylori antibody testing was ordered.
- The patient's NGT output and stool output are being monitored closely.
- The patient's right-sided heart failure is likely secondary to severe tricuspid regurgitation.
- Diuretic therapy is being held due to the GI bleed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis but experienced an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a bleeding ulcer in the duodenal bulb. She received epinephrine injection and cauterization. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been fluctuating, ranging from 28.7% to 32.3%. She also has melena, likely indicating previous upper GI bleeding. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/64 to 124/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient had a significant upper GI bleed due to a duodenal ulcer. She is currently stable but requires close monitoring of her Hct levels. If they drop below the threshold for transfusion (30), she may require blood transfusion. She is refusing transfusion at the moment. The presence of melena suggests further evaluation for ongoing bleeding.

2. Right-sided failure: The patient has severe right-sided failure"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation. She was admitted for diuresis and experienced complications such as an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer.

The patient has undergone epinephrine injection and cauterization for the GI bleed, with stable hematocrit levels. Melena, likely related to the previous upper GI bleed, has been observed. The plan is to check hemoglobin and hematocrit every 12 hours if stable and not to perform an endoscopy at this time.

The patient also has right-sided heart failure, likely secondary to severe tricuspid regurgitation. Diurese has been held due to the GI bleed. Beta-blockers have also been withheld while the patient is hypotensive and does not require rate control for atrial fibrillation.

The patient has a history of alcohol abuse, but there are no signs of withdrawal, and her CIWA (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment) score is 0. She has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is well-controlled with mesalamine. The patient's social history includes bruises on her legs and an awkward response to questions about falls, leading to concerns about possible abuse at home. Social work has been asked to evaluate this further.

The patient is currently advancing to clear"

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and her course was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer. The patient received epinephrine injection and cauterization for the bleed. Her hemoglobin (Hct) levels are stable at 28.7, likely due to hemodilution. Melena is suspected as a previous upper GI bleed. 

The plan is to monitor her Hct levels every 12 hours if stable, refrain from rescope today since she is stable, maintain three peripheral intravenous lines (22-gauge x 2, 18-gauge EJ), continue IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion, and blood type and crossmatch her with a threshold for transfusion at 30. The patient has consented but is refusing transfusion. Follow-up H. pylori antibody testing is also planned.

Regarding her right-sided failure, it is likely secondary to severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation). Diuretic therapy will be held due to the recent GI bleed. Beta-blockers will also be held while she is hypotensive and not requiring rate control of atrial fibrillation (AFib). There doesn't seem to be a need to worsen preload dependency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and experienced a complicated course with an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer. The patient has been monitored closely in the critical care unit (CCU) due to the risk of further bleeding, but no additional episodes have been observed. Her hematocrit (HCT) levels have remained stable.

The patient's vital signs are generally within normal ranges, although her blood pressure is on the lower side. Her heart rate is controlled, and she is not experiencing any dizziness, lightheadedness, or fatigue while ambulating. Metoprolol was restarted due to tachycardia and atrial fibrillation.

The patient has allergies to lisinopril, causing a rash and abdominal pain, as well as hives from cefazolin sodium and sulfonamide antibiotics. She has received infusions of fluids and other medications in the ICU.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the recent GI bleed. The patient's weight has decreased from 88.8 kg at admission to 79 kg currently.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,918 mL, with 870 mL administered through the oral route, 1,048 mL through intravenous fluids, and 300 mL of blood products given. The total output includes 1,230 mL of urine, 300 mL of stool, and 688 mL of NG drainage. The patient's respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery via nasal cannula, and her ABG results are within normal limits.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight/obese, anxious, with no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination shows irregular rhythm without murmurs or gallops, and her respiratory/chest examination demonstrates clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdominal examination is soft and non-tender, without epigastric tenderness. Neurologic examination shows an alert and oriented patient who can answer questions and follow commands appropriately.

Laboratory results show normal levels for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Other lab values are also within normal ranges.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient had evidence of bleeding from a duodenal ulcer, which was treated with epinephrine injection and cauterization. Her HCT levels are stable, likely due to hemodilution. Melena is likely related to a previous upper GI bleed. The plan includes monitoring HCT levels every 12 hours if stable, not repeating endoscopy today since the patient is stable, and continuing IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) administration. Blood has been typed and crossed, with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and experienced complications from an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed caused by a duodenal ulcer. The patient received an epinephrine injection and cauterization, resulting in stable hemoglobin levels. She has been monitored closely with serial HCTs and has shown no further episodes of melena or bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she is alert and oriented. Her labs indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. The patient's atrial fibrillation is currently rate-controlled, and her right-sided failure is likely secondary to severe TR. She has a history of alcohol abuse but is not currently showing signs of withdrawal. The patient's ulcerative colitis is well-controlled with mesalamine, and social concerns regarding bruises on her legs and awkward responses have been noted. The patient is progressing well with advancements in her diet and fluid intake. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right-sided failure: The patient's severe TR (tricuspid regurgitation) may be causing her right-sided failure. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the abdomen (ascites) and liver congestion.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and experienced a course complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer, which has since been cauterized. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has remained stable at around 26 overnight and is likely due to hemodilution with increased oral intake. There have been no further episodes of melena or bleeding, and the patient is asymptomatic without dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, or dysuria. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (90-122 bpm), blood pressure of 99/55 mmHg (64-131/36-79 mmHg), respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute (12-27 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is alert, oriented, and responding appropriately to commands.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.7 thousand/mm³ (6.6-10.1 thousand/mm³), hematocrit of 26% (35.7-47.3%), platelet count of 293 thousand/mm³ (150-"

   injeciton + cauterization.  Hct stable 26 overnight, and currently 26
   likely [**1-22**] hemodillution w/ increasing PO intake.  Pt asymptomatic at
   this HCT.  Melana likely [**1-22**] previous UGI bleed.
   - Will check qD Hcts since they are stable.   H. pylori antibody
   negative

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and experienced complications including an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer, which has been cauterized.

24-hour events: The patient remained in the critical care unit (CCU) due to a lack of available beds on the floor. Her beta-blocker was restarted at 12.5 mg, and her diuretics were continued to be held. She denies recent vomiting and reports passing gas. There are no signs of dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's weight is currently 79 kg, compared to her admission weight of 88.8 kg.

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37°C (98.6°F)
- Heart rate: 88 bpm (85-108 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 93/59 mmHg (67-121/74-92 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 13 breaths per minute (13-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 91%
- Heart rhythm: Atrial fibrillation
- Other vital signs and parameters are within normal limits or stable.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with PMH of atrial fibrillation, hypertension,
   hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR, severe right
   sided failure admitted for diuresis and course complicated by upper GI
   bleed from duodenal ulcer, now cauterized.
   .
   #. GI bleed: Evidence of bleeding ulcer in duodenal bulb. S/P epi
   injeciton + cauterization.  Hct stable 26 overnight, and currently 26
   likely [**1-22**] hemodillution w/ increasing PO intake.  Pt asymptomatic at
   this HCT.  Melana likely [**1-22**] previous UGI bleed.
   - Will check qD Hcts since they are stable.   H. pylori antibody
   negative
   - 3 PIVs (22gauge x 2, 18g EJ)
   - change IV PPI to PO BID 40mg if pt. able to tolerate PO.
   - Blood typed and crossed, consent in chart
 patient refusing
   transfusion initially, after further discussion patient is agreeable.
   But given stable HCT at 26, will continue to monitor and transfuse if
   HCT < 25.
   .
   #. Right sided failure: Likely secondary to severe TR.  I/Os were
   positive 300cc over 32hrs, w/ increasing PO intake, thus no concerns
   re: preload from volume status at this point.    Will attempt to
   decrease rate to improve filling.
   - Hold on diuresis given GI bleed suspicion and low BPs.
   - Restarted BB as HR in 100-110 w/ holding parameters for hypotension,
   for rate control of AFib.
   .
   #. CAD: No evidence of CAD on cath.
   - Holding ASA given bleed
   .
   #. Atrial Fibrillation: Currently rate controlled. CHADS score = 2
   considering diastolic dysfunction and hypertension, however patient is
   not currently anticoagulated, given concern for her alcohol abuse.
   - On ASA, but holding for now. Can consider coumadin when stabilizes
   for > 48hrs.
   .
   #. History of Alcohol abuse: No evidence of withdrawal. CIWA scores 0.
   .
   #. UC: Recently well controlled, continue mesalamine
   - Per GI, ulceration was not consistent with Chrons.
   #. Social: Based on bruises on backs of pt
s legs and pt
s awkward
   response to
have you fallen recently?
 will ask Social work to come
   evaluate for ? abuse at home.
   .
   #. FEN: advancing to fulls and regular, no IVF.
   #. Access: PIV, 18G EJ
   #. PPx: Pneumoboots (holding SCH during GIB)
   #. Code: FULL
   #. Dispo: Hct stable, will transfer back to floor.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diastolic heart failure, moderate 3+ TR (tricuspid regurgitation), and severe right-sided failure. She was admitted for diuresis and her course was complicated by an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed from a duodenal ulcer, which has been cauterized.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with a range of 85-108 bpm, blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg with a range of 67-121/33-74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute with a range of 13-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. Her weight is currently 79 kg, with a previous admission weight of 88.8 kg. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids totaling 600 mL, with an output of 300 mL through the urinary catheter. She also has a nasogastric tube in place.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.2 thousand cells per microliter, hemoglobin level of 7.7 grams per deciliter, hematocrit of 35.7%, platelet count of 170 thousand cells per microliter, creatinine"
