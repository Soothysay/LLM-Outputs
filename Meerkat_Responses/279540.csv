","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented with malaise and cough for one week. She is now in the ICU due to pneumonia, which is likely an infectious etiology. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 97/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. 

The physical examination reveals a pleasant middle-aged woman in mild respiratory distress, with coarse breath sounds at the right base and egophony. The patient has no jugular venous distention, regular heart sounds with no murmurs, and soft non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds. Her extremities are warm and dry, with no edema and palpable distal pulses. The patient is alert and awake, but shows mild facial flushing.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.2 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 28.8%, normal platelet count (Plt) of 218 K/uL, low creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dL, low potassium (K+) of 3.0 mEq/L, normal sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, slightly elevated chloride (Cl-) of 114 mEq/L, normal bicarbonate (HCO3) of 28.8%, low magnesium (Mg++) of 1.5 mg/dL, low phosphate (PO4) of 2.1 mg/dL, and normal blood glucose (Glucose) of 100 mg/dL.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring for increased work of breathing, hypotension, and potential complications such as sepsis or pneumonia. The patient is receiving IV fluids for resuscitation and antibiotic treatment for suspected bacterial infection. The plan includes obtaining sputum cultures, follow-up chest X-ray, arterial blood gas analysis, and continued monitoring."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a history of malaise and cough for one week. She is currently in the ICU due to suspected pneumonia. Her vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. The patient is receiving respiratory support with CPAP/PSV mode, and her oxygen saturation is 93%. Her blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urine cultures have been sent for analysis. She has been treated with various antibiotics since admission. The patient's lab results indicate elevated WBC count and CRP levels, as well as abnormal electrolyte levels. She also has a history of depression and is being treated with Geodon, Prozac, and Ritalin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and fever may suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation indicate a risk of respiratory failure if her condition worsens.
3. Pneumonia complications: Since the patient is suspected to have pneumonia, she may develop complications such as lung abscess, pleural effusion, or empyema.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobilization in the ICU increases her risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE).
5. Medication reactions: Given the patient's history of allergic reactions"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of fever, non-productive cough, and improved breathing. She has been receiving various antibiotics since her admission, including Levofloxacin, Vancomycin, Azithromycin, and Ceftazidime. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 100% oxygen, and has a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.3°F (38.5°C), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/58 to 129/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 43 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient's blood cultures and Legionella antigen test are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent culture samples may help in early detection and management.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections. Regular assessment of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and surveillance cultures can aid in identifying any potential infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of malaise and cough for one week, which likely represents pneumonia. The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and desaturations, suggesting an infectious etiology. The initial plan was to treat for Staphylococcus and other bacteria, with ongoing monitoring for increased work of breathing and the possibility of progressing to respiratory aids.

The patient also has hypotension, which could be her baseline, but in the setting of infection, it may represent sepsis. IV fluids are being given as needed to keep the blood pressure above 90 mmHg, and there is consideration for placing a central line for access and adding pressors as needed. The use of spironolactone is being held due to low blood pressures.

Additionally, the patient has a history of depression and is on medication for it. She is also being held NPO (nothing by mouth) with replete lytes (electrolytes). Heparin subcutaneous prophylaxis is being given, and she has two peripheral intravenous lines in place.

Arterial line placement occurred on [**2178-12-3**] at 06:00 PM, and a 20-gauge line was placed on [**2178-12-3**] at 09:16 PM.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient has experienced episodes of desaturation overnight with any movement, indicating possible respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachypnea, with a heart rate of 94 bpm and a respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation is 93%, which is below the normal range.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, suggesting an ongoing infection or inflammation. The hematocrit level is within normal range at 27.4%. The platelet count appears to be normal as well.

The patient is receiving multiple medications, including antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftazidime) for the treatment of pneumonia, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient is also receiving stress ulcer prophylaxis and is on a ventilator with aerosol-cool delivery device to provide oxygen.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or progression of the underlying infection."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of malaise and cough for one week, which is likely pneumonia. She is experiencing tachypnea and desaturations, suggesting an infectious etiology. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The patient is currently being treated with Vancomycin, Ceftazidime, and Azithromycin.

The patient also has hypotension, which could represent her baseline, but in the setting of infection, it may indicate sepsis. Fluid resuscitation is being administered to keep the blood pressure above 90 mmHg. A central line has been placed for access and additional pressors may be needed.

The patient has a history of depression and is on Geodon, Prozac, and Ritalin. Her diet is regular, and she has replete electrolytes. Prophylactic heparin is being given subcutaneously. The patient's arterial line was inserted on 12/3 at 6:00 PM, and a 20-gauge line was placed on 12/4 at 10:00 PM.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's tachypnea and desaturations indicate respiratory distress, which could progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately. Close monitoring and timely intervention with respiratory aids are necessary.

2. Infection: Pneumonia is suspected in this patient. The use"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented with malaise and cough for one week. She is diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, likely caused by a bacterial superinfection following a viral illness. The patient is currently being treated for Staph and atypical bacteria with a combination of antibiotics. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been ordered. The initial antibiotic regimen includes Vanc, Ceftaz, and Azithromycin, but it is planned to wean down antibiotics to Vanc and Azithromycin.

The patient also experienced episodes of hypotension, which have since resolved. IV fluids are being administered as needed to maintain blood pressure above 90 mmHg. Spironolactone has been held due to low blood pressures. The patient's depression is being managed with Geodon, Prozac, and Ritalin.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 to 157/140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is receiving respiratory support through an aerosol-cool device.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Other lab values such as creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with pneumonia. The patient has experienced episodes of desaturation overnight and was changed to standing given the inability to cough up secretions. The patient has a history of allergies to clindamycin, which caused facial swelling. The patient received antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftazidime. The patient is on heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's medical and family history are unchanged from admission. The patient's review of systems is also unchanged except for the noted events.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and other comorbidities. She is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/56 mmHg to 157/140 mmHg, respiratory rate of 34 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. 

The patient has been experiencing episodes of desaturations overnight with any movement. She has also been unable to cough up secretions, leading to a change in position to standing. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL and a slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL. The platelet count is within normal range. The blood glucose levels are fluctuating between 100 mg/dL and 132 mg/dL. Other lab values such as creatinine, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, PT/PTT/INR, and differential counts are within normal limits. 

The patient is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, as well as other ICU medications. She is also receiving antibiotics (levofloxacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftazidime) for her pneumonia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with Haemophilus flu bacteremia and respiratory failure. The patient required intubation and sedation due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. The patient also experienced hypotension, which responded to fluid resuscitation. The patient's condition improved with the initiation of appropriate antibiotics (ceftazidime and azithromycin) as recommended by the ID consult. Other issues include depression, for which certain medications were held. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and abnormal kidney function. Imaging studies reveal diffuse opacities on chest X-ray and significant effusion with intraparenchymal consolidations on CT chest. Microbiology results indicate the presence of gram-negative rods. The patient's respiratory viral antigen test was negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of malaise, cough, and subsequent respiratory failure suggests a potential complication related to the H. flu infection. This could lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Bacterial Superinfection: Given the patient's compromised respiratory status and prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection, which could worsen his condition and require additional interventions.

3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure initially indicated hypotension,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with Haemophilus flu infection and bacteremia. The patient developed respiratory failure and is now intubated and sedated. The initial plan included increasing PEEP to 15 as tolerated, decreasing tidal volumes, and fluid resuscitation. The patient's hypotension was managed with bolus fluids and a new arterial line was placed. His blood pressure is now stable. The patient also has hyperchloremic hypotension, which needs to be monitored. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: Due to the prolonged intubation and sedation, the patient is at risk of developing nosocomial pneumonia. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early identification of any changes in sputum production or oxygenation would be important.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin sodium should be continued to reduce the risk.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers due to increased gastric acid secretion. Proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole should be continued to prevent stress ulcers.
4. Ventilator-associated events: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated events such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of feeling tired and tachypneic. The patient has been experiencing frequent desaturations below 90% and was intubated at 1600 for increased work of breathing. The patient's medical history is significant for allergies to clindamycin, which caused facial swelling, and previous antibiotic use including levofloxacin, vancomycin, azithromycin, and ceftazidime.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent symptoms. The patient's vital signs show a fever of 101.9°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/46 mmHg to 134/108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal glucose level, and abnormal kidney function with elevated creatinine levels. The blood cultures grew H. flu, which is beta-lactamase negative. Imaging studies such as a chest X-ray and CT chest/sinus are pending.

The patient's physical examination findings are limited due to intubation, but peripheral pulses and skin assessments"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. influenzae influenza and bacteremia, and continues to experience respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. He is currently being treated with antibiotics, but still has fevers and positive cultures for GNR bacteria in the sputum. The patient also has signs of sinusitis on a CT scan.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory failure and positive pressure ventilation may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can result in severe lung injury and difficulty in oxygenation.

2. Bacterial Suprainfection: The patient's persistent fever and positive cultures for GNR bacteria indicate a possible bacterial superinfection. This can complicate the treatment and increase the risk of sepsis.

3. Hypotension: The patient requires fluid resuscitation and vasopressors to maintain adequate blood pressure. There is a concern for hypotension, especially considering the hyperchloremic acidosis seen in the lab results.

4. Depression: The patient's mental health history includes depression, and it is important to manage his psychiatric medications while he is sedated.

5. Malnutrition: The patient's ability to receive enteral nutrition may be compromised due to his respiratory condition. Malnutrition can further impair"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF otherwise healthy c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H.
   Flu + bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H. Flu PNA +/- effusions/edema.
   Likely bacterial suprainfection following viral illness.  Now intubated
   and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz/Azithro per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**], however patient continues to
   grow GNR
s in sputum and continues to have fevers, will follow
   sensitivities, but may need to broaden antibiotic coverage and/or tap
   effusions
   - Will check for other source of infection, follow pan culture, check
   amylase and lipase, add on a diff to rule out drug fever
   - CT scan showed signs of sinusitis, will start afrin today
   - Fluid resuscitate to allow for greater sedation
   - Currently on low tidal volumes with elevated PEEP per ARDS net, will
   switch to PSV today to attempt to have better vent compliance, may be
   able to come down on sedation and thus pressors
   #Hypotension:  IVF resuscitation yesterday, required levophed initation
   overnight for increased sedation for better vent compliance,  stable on
   pressors with new A-line in place.
   -LR for hyperchloremic hypotension to keep SBP >90
   -Holding spironolactone in setting of low blood pressures
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE pending
   #Depression
   -Hold Geodon, Prozac and Ritalin while sedated

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted with malaise and cough. He was diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. His condition has not improved despite antibiotic therapy, as he continues to grow Gram-negative rods (GNR) in his sputum and has persistent fevers. A CT scan showed signs of sinusitis. The patient requires fluid resuscitation to allow for greater sedation. He is currently on low tidal volumes with elevated PEEP per ARDS net and will be switched to pressure support ventilation (PSV) today to improve vent compliance. The patient is also being treated for hypotension with IV fluids and norepinephrine. Other medical conditions include depression, for which certain medications are being held. The patient is receiving nutrition through tube feeds and prophylactic heparin. His code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF otherwise healthy c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H.
   Flu + bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H. Flu PNA +/- effusions/edema.
   Likely bacterial suprainfection following viral illness.  Now intubated
   and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz/Azithro per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**], increased Ceftaz to 2 gm on
   [**12-7**], however patient continues to grow GNR
s in sputum, persistent
   fevers so added vanc per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-6**]
   - Will check for other source of infection, follow pan culture
   - CT scan showed signs of sinusitis, started afrin yesterday
   - Fluid resuscitate to allow for greater sedation
   - Currently on CMV, will attempt to ventilate at ardsnet if patient
   tolerates it
   - Will repeat CXR, if able to see evidence for plug or something to
   cause acute decompensation, then will stop.  If not, will consider
   thoracentesis to tap effusion vs. lasix gtt titrated to BP to attempt
   diuresis 1-2 L today.
   #Hypotension:  IVF resuscitation yesterday, required levophed initation
   overnight for increased sedation for better vent compliance,  stable
   off pressors
   -LR for hyperchloremic hypotension to keep SBP >90
   -Holding spironolactone in setting of low blood pressures
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE pending-f/u on results
   #Depression
   -Hold Geodon, Prozac and Ritalin while sedated

","The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, and is now experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. He has ARDS/hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by a bacterial superinfection following a viral illness.

The patient's current medications include ceftazidime, azithromycin, vancomycin, fentanyl, midazolam, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole. His vital signs show a temperature of 102.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 114/58 to 87/47 mmHg, heart rate between 82-103 bpm, respiratory rate of 17-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.

The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 27.5 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL, platelet count of 359 K/uL, and various abnormalities in kidney and liver function tests. The patient's blood cultures show growth of GNR bacteria in the sputum.

The plan is to continue with ID recommendations, increase ceftazidime to 2 gm Q8H, and add back vancomycin. The patient will undergo further evaluation for other sources of infection, including a repeat chest X"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with H. influenzae pneumonia who developed ARDS. She required intubation and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient also needed increased pressor doses recently and has had continuous fevers. Levo was weaned off this morning, but the patient desaturated, so FiO2 was increased to 80%. The patient has shown no acute distress and has normal vital signs. However, her respiratory support indicates that she is on mechanical ventilation with a set Vt of 320 mL, PS of 4 cmH2O, RR set at 24, PEEP at 10 cmH2O, and FiO2 at 80%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 160, and Ve of 12.6 L/min. 

The patient's lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct, and slightly elevated Cr levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, but her lactic acid level is slightly elevated at 1.6 mmol/L. The patient's microbiology results indicate sputum and blood cultures positive for H. influenzae. 

The assessment and plan include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, and hypotension. The physician plans to get a chest X-ray (CXR) to evaluate for derecruitment and"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old woman with H. influenza pneumonia who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She was initially doing well without intubation but required mechanical ventilation and pressors recently. The patient also had fevers and was desaturated in the morning, so the FiO2 was increased to 80%.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54 to 120/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The mixed venous oxygen saturation is at 80%. The central venous pressure (CVP) is 6 mmHg, and the heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,457 mL with 801 mL given as total in, 695 mL as TF, 1,452 mL as IVF, and 373 mL as IVF output. The total output includes 1,215 mL of blood products and 560 mL of urine.

In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 320 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 80%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio of 160, and a respiratory rate (RR) of 24 breaths per minute.

The physical examination reveals crackles in both lungs, particularly more prominent on the left side. The patient's neurologic examination shows no responsiveness, and the laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 27.5 K/uL and an elevated lactate level of 1.6 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, and the plan includes increasing PEEP and diuresis if the chest X-ray (CXR) shows no improvement. The patient also has pneumonia, for which vancomycin has been added to the antibiotic regimen. Hypotension is due to septic shock, and the patient is currently off pressors. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and stress ulcers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of ARDS, ventilator-associated complications, infections due to prolonged immobility and antibiotic resistance, and potential renal or hepatic dysfunction. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, and laboratory parameters will be necessary to address any potential complications promptly."

","The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia and continues to experience respiratory failure. The patient has ARDS/hypoxic respiratory failure, likely secondary to a bacterial superinfection following a viral illness. He is currently intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing.

The patient has been on various antibiotics, including Ceftazidime and Azithromycin, but continues to have persistent fevers. Therefore, Vancomycin was added to the treatment regimen. The patient also has sinusitis, for which he was started on Afrin.

The patient has hypotension that required IV fluid resuscitation and initiation of norepinephrine overnight. His blood pressure is now stable off pressors. Lactate levels have been within normal limits.

A bedside echo showed suboptimal image quality, hyperdynamic left ventricular function (EF 75%), mild mitral regurgitation, and no vegetations seen. However, the absence of vegetation does not exclude endocarditis.

The patient has anemia, likely due to chronic disease and poor bone marrow response. A transfusion is recommended for hematocrit <21. The patient's depression medication (Geodon, Prozac, Ritalin) should be held while sedated.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, using assist-control mode ventilation (AC"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF otherwise healthy c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H.
   Flu + bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H. Flu PNA +/- effusions/edema.
   Likely bacterial suprainfection following viral illness.  Now intubated
   and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz/Azithro per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**], increased Ceftaz to 2 gm on
   [**12-7**], however patient continues to grow GNR
s in sputum, persistent
   fevers so added vanc per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-6**]
   - Will check for other source of infection, follow pan culture
   - CT scan showed signs of sinusitis, started afrin yesterday
   - Fluid resuscitate to allow for greater sedation
   - Currently on CMV, will attempt to ventilate at ardsnet if patient
   tolerates it
   - Will repeat CXR, if able to see evidence for plug or something to
   cause acute decompensation, then will stop.  If not, will consider
   thoracentesis to tap effusion vs. lasix gtt titrated to BP to attempt
   diuresis 1-2 L today.
   #Hypotension:  IVF resuscitation yesterday, required levophed initation
   overnight for increased sedation for better vent compliance,  stable
   off pressors
   -LR for hyperchloremic hypotension to keep SBP >90
   -Holding spironolactone in setting of low blood pressures
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE pending-f/u on results
   #Depression
   -Hold Geodon, Prozac and Ritalin while sedated

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of malaise and cough. The patient has been diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, and is experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.8°F (Tmax: 38.8°C), heart rate of 77 bpm with a sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 99/49 to 122/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on the ventilator.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, but there are some abnormalities in electrolyte levels such as low calcium and magnesium levels. The liver enzymes are within normal limits, while the kidney function tests show slightly elevated creatinine levels.

The patient's chest X-ray revealed signs of pneumonia, and a CT scan showed evidence of sinusitis. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including Ceftazidime, Azithromycin, and Vancomycin. The patient also received Lasix to attempt diuresis and improve oxygenation.

The patient's condition is being managed in the ICU with ventilatory support, fluid resuscitation, and sedation. The patient is receiving tube feeds"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with H flu and PNA/ARDS who is currently in the ICU. She received lasix for diuresis and an echo yesterday showed hyperdynamic LV. The patient has been febrile, with a maximum temperature of 101.8 degrees Fahrenheit. She has been on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, with set Vt of 320 mL, RR of 22, PEEP of 12 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 99%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, HCO3 of 149 mEq/L, and O2 saturation of 298. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 102/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, heparin, and others. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's condition indicates ARDS, which is a severe form of lung injury characterized by acute onset, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and hypoxemia. ARDS can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. Infection"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. influenzae influenza and bacteremia, along with continuing respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. His condition has been worsening, with a recent increase in infiltrate on the right side of his chest X-ray. The patient has been started on antibiotics (Ceftazidime and Azithromycin), and additional medications have been added based on ID recommendations. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 109/55 mmHg, heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is receiving IV fluids, lasix, and acetazolamide for diuresis, as well as pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count and lactate levels. He is also anemic, likely due to chronic disease or infection, and has been advised to receive a blood transfusion for a hematocrit level below 21. The patient has been diagnosed with ARDS, likely secondary to H. influenzae pneumonia. He is also at risk for constipation, depression, and pressure-related rash. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the MICU.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of malaise and cough for one week.
- She was diagnosed with H. flu and bacteremia, and continues to experience respiratory failure.
- The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing.
- She has been treated with antibiotics (Ceftazidime and Azithromycin) for bacterial superinfection.
- The patient's condition is complicated by ARDS/hypoxic respiratory failure, likely caused by H. flu pneumonia.
- She also has signs of sinusitis.
- The patient is being weaned off mechanical ventilation and is expected to undergo a trial of pressure support.
- She has hypotension that is being managed with IV fluids and vasopressors.
- The patient has anemia, which is likely due to chronic disease, infection, or repeated blood draws.
- Her bone marrow response is poor, indicated by a low reticulocyte count.
- The patient has depression and is being held on certain medications.
- She has constipation and is being treated with a fiber supplement.
- The patient has pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and alterations in nutrition.
- Her ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and monitoring of vital signs and lab results.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female who presented with malaise and cough for one week, now diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, along with ongoing respiratory failure. She has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. The patient's condition has worsened, with a worsening infiltrate on the right side as seen on the chest X-ray. 

The patient has been treated with multiple antibiotics, including ceftazidime and azithromycin, due to suspected bacterial superinfection following viral illness. However, she continues to have persistent fevers. 

The patient also has hypotension, which has been managed with IV fluid resuscitation and the initiation of vasopressors. She has been weaned off the pressors and is currently stable. 

There is a concern for anemia, likely due to chronic disease or infection, with a low reticulocyte count. The patient will receive a blood transfusion to increase her hemoglobin concentration. 

The patient is also experiencing constipation, despite being on an aggressive bowel regimen. Manual disimpaction was attempted, and an enema may be administered if there is no stool in the bowel vault. 

The patient's depression medication will be held while she is sedated. 

The patient has a rash that is likely related to head and pressure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient was put on standing Lasix 40mg IV BID with additional doses as needed, which resulted in the output of 2300 cc of urine in one hour. The patient has allergies to clindamycin, with a history of face swelling. The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, heparin sodium, and pantoprazole.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 100.2°F (37.9°C), blood pressure ranging from 83/45 mmHg to 100/67 mmHg, heart rate between 81-105 bpm, respiratory rate of 19-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total input of 3730 mL and a total output of 5330 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1600 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 554 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 21 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 31, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 330, and ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch.

Physical examination reveals generalized edema improved from yesterday, palpable distal pulses, and a macular, confluent, blanching rash on the lower portion of the back. The patient's laboratory results show elevated potassium levels, slightly low sodium levels, normal hemoglobin, white blood cell count, and platelet count. The patient's liver enzymes are within normal range, while the creatinine level is low. The patient's blood cultures were negative.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's medical complications include constipation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), alteration in nutrition, pneumonia, and other conditions. The patient is being managed in the ICU with appropriate respiratory support, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF otherwise healthy c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H.
   Flu + bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H. Flu PNA +/- effusions/edema.
   Likely bacterial suprainfection following viral illness.  Now intubated
   and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR improved
   today, despite rising temp/wbc
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz/Azithro per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**], increased Ceftaz to 2 gm on
   [**12-7**],  had persistent fevers so added vanc per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-6**], will
   discontinue azithro/vanc
   - Follow pan cultures
   - Continue to diurese additional 1-2 L today, given metabolic
   alkalosis, will add Acetazolamide in addition to lasix for total of 4
   doses
   - Follow PM lytes in setting of diuresis
   - Will Cx if temp >100.4
   - Wean vent today, decrease PEEP to 5 on AM rounds, attempt SBT this
   afternoon.
   #Hypotension:  IVF resuscitation yesterday, required levophed initation
   overnight for increased sedation for better vent compliance,  Stable
   off pressors-Resolved
   -LR for hyperchloremic hypotension to keep SBP >90
   -Holding spironolactone
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE no vegetation though suboptimal study.  In absence of fevers will
   not pursue TEE
   .
   #Anemia-Likely baseline anemia of chronic disease with repeated blood
   draws.  Now with poor Bone marrow response given low retic count.,
   likely due to infection.
   -transfuse for HCT <21, appropritate bump to 23 yesterday after 1 uPRBC
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -Continue to monitor clinically for signs of bleeding.
   # Constipation-perhaps more constipated at baseline, but has only had
   small BM and flatus while in house, this morning had several large BM,
   but X ray shows full of stool
   -Wean fentanyl and uptitrate midaz as needed for sedation, if
   ineffective switch to propofol
   -Currently on aggressive bowel regimen
   - C diff sent
   .
   #Depression
   -Hold Geodon, Prozac and Ritalin while sedated
   .
   #Rash-likely related to head and pressure

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of H. Flu and bacteremia, currently experiencing respiratory failure. He has been intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. The patient's condition has shown some improvement with an improved chest X-ray today, despite rising temperature and white blood cell count.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which has been managed with IV fluid resuscitation and the initiation of levophed overnight. However, the patient is now stable off pressors.

2. Anemia: The patient has a likely baseline anemia of chronic disease with repeated blood draws. Additionally, there is poor bone marrow response given the low reticulocyte count, likely due to infection. The plan is to transfuse for HCT <21 and appropriate bump to 23 yesterday after 1 uPRBC.

3. Constipation: The patient has been constipated while in the ICU. Although he had several large bowel movements this morning, the X-ray shows fullness in the bowel. The plan is to wean fentanyl and uptitrate midazolam as needed for sedation, if ineffective switch to propofol. Aggressive bowel regimen and monitoring are also planned.

4. ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to H."

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, resulting in respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. The chest X-ray showed worsening infiltrate on the right side, while the left side remained unchanged.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can occur as a result of severe lung injury. This is indicated by the worsening infiltrate on the chest X-ray and the need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Bacterial Superinfection: Given the patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay, there is a risk of developing a secondary bacterial infection. Close monitoring of vital signs and prompt investigation of any new symptoms are essential.

3. Constipation: The patient has a history of constipation, which may be exacerbated by immobilization and sedation. A bowel regimen has been initiated, and manual disimpaction and enema may be considered if necessary.

4. Anemia: The patient has a low hematocrit level, indicating anemia. This could be due to chronic disease or poor bone marrow response secondary to infection. Blood transfusion has been ordered to increase the hematocrit level.

5. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which was initially managed with intravenous fluid"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with H. flu PNA and ARDS. The patient continues to improve, but remains critically ill. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds and sputum culture should be done to monitor for this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of DVT. The use of compression boots for prophylaxis is mentioned, but close monitoring of the patient's lower extremities for signs of swelling or pain is necessary.
3. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at increased risk of developing stress ulcers. The patient is already on stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole (Protonix), but ongoing monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is essential.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance over the past 24 hours shows an intake of 3,730 mL and output of 5,330 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,600 mL. Close monitoring of the patient's fluid status and adjustment of fluid administration may be necessary.
5. ARDS progression: Although the patient is improving, there is still a risk of worsening ARDS. Continuous monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU with a variety of medical conditions. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient has been experiencing tachypnea and required a non-invasive ventilation support trial (NIVST) but failed it due to a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) greater than 100. Consequently, the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation.

- The patient's vital signs show a heart rate (HR) of 106 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 88/41 mmHg to 144/81 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98%.

- The patient has received multiple medications including propofol, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium.

- The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt), along with low sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (HCO3-), magnesium (Mg++), calcium (Ca++), and albumin levels.

- The patient's imaging shows improvement in a diffuse infiltrate seen on a chest X-ray (CXR).

- The patient tested negative for Clostridium difficile toxin A & B.

   intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR
   improved today, despite rising temp/wbc
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**], increased Ceftaz to 2 gm on [**12-7**],  had
   persistent fevers so added vanc per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-6**], will
   discontinue azithro/vanc
   - Follow pan cultures
   - Will Cx if temp >100.4
   - Wean vent today, decrease PEEP to 5 on AM rounds, attempt SBT this
   afternoon.
   #Hypotension:  IVF resuscitation yesterday, required levophed initation
   overnight for increased sedation for better vent compliance,  Stable

   -Holding spironolactone
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE no vegetation though suboptimal study.  In absence of fevers will
   not pursue TEE
   #Anemia-Likely baseline anemia of chronic disease with repeated blood
   draws.  Now with poor Bone marrow response given low retic count.,
   likely due to infection.
   -transfuse for HCT <21, appropritate bump to 23 yesterday after 1 uPRBC
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -Continue to monitor clinically for signs of bleeding.
   # Constipation-perhaps more constipated at baseline, but has only had
   small BM and flatus while in house, this morning had several large BM,
   but X ray shows full of stool
   -Wean fentanyl and uptitrate midaz as needed for sedation, if
   ineffective switch to propofol
   -Currently on aggressive bowel regimen
   - C diff sent

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented with malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with influenza (H. flu) and bacteremia and continues to experience respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. His chest X-ray has shown improvement, despite an increase in temperature and white blood cell count. The patient's medical history includes anemia, depression, constipation, and a rash.

Potential medical complications:

1. ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's condition of respiratory failure may progress into Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), especially with the presence of diffuse infiltrate on chest X-ray and rising temperature and white blood cell count.

2. C. difficile Infection: Although the feces tested negative for C. difficile toxin A & B, the patient's symptoms of malaise, cough, and diarrhea could still be indicative of an infection. Monitoring for symptoms of C. difficile infection is crucial.

3. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which has since resolved. However, close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to maintain a systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

4. Anemia: The patient's anemia could be due to chronic disease or poor bone marrow response. It is important to continue monitoring the patient for signs of bleeding and consider transfusion if the hematocrit level falls below"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who has been admitted to the ICU. He has a history of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. His vital signs include a temperature of 101.1 F, blood pressure ranging from 121/59-128/61 mmHg, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.51, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 314, and oxygen ventilation (Ve) of 9.4 L/min.

The patient has undergone several cultures, including blood cultures from both the PICC line and venipuncture, as well as a urine culture. The cultures were taken on December 12th. The patient's allergies include clindamycin, which causes facial swelling.

The patient's medication list includes propofol infusion, fentanyl, pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and furosemide (Lasix). The patient has received various antibiotics, including azithromycin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for fever. The patient's fluid balance shows a"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF otherwise healthy c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H.
   Flu + bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure: H. Flu PNA +/- effusions. Now
   intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR
   improved today, despite rising temp/wbc.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Ceftaz per ID Day 1=[**2177-12-1**]
   - Follow pan cultures
   - Will Cx if temp >100.4
   - Wean vent today, decrease PEEP to 5 on AM rounds, attempt SBT this
   afternoon.
   - Continue Diuresis with lasix 10mg IV QID goal -2L
   #Hypotension:  Resolved.
   -LR for hyperchloremic hypotension to keep SBP >90
   -Holding spironolactone
   -Lactate has been within normal limits
   - TTE no vegetation though suboptimal study.  In absence of fevers will
   not pursue TEE
   #Anemia-Likely baseline anemia of chronic disease with repeated blood
   draws.  Now with poor Bone marrow response given low retic count.,
   likely due to infection.
   -transfuse for HCT <21, appropritate bump to 23 yesterday after 1 uPRBC
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -Continue to monitor clinically for signs of bleeding.
   # Constipation-perhaps more constipated at baseline, but has only had
   small BM and flatus while in house, this morning had several large BM,
   but X ray shows full of stool
   -Wean fentanyl and uptitrate midaz as needed for sedation, if
   ineffective switch to propofol
   -Currently on aggressive bowel regimen
   - C diff sent
   #Depression
   -Hold Geodon, Prozac and Ritalin while sedated
   #Rash-likely related to head and pressure

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of malaise and cough for one week. He was diagnosed with H. influenzae influenza (flu) and bacteremia, leading to respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. The chest X-ray showed improvement today despite a rising temperature and white blood cell count.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this information include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia. The healthcare team should closely monitor for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy if necessary.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of blood clots. The patient has a PICC line and is bedridden, making him at risk for developing DVT, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening PE.

3. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or surgical site infections.

4. Pressure injuries: Immobility and prolonged bed rest can lead to pressure injuries, particularly in areas susceptible to pressure and shear forces.

5. Delirium: Sedation, ICU environment, and underlying health conditions can contribute to delirium in critically ill patients"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF admitted for c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H. Flu +
   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Likely post viral pneumonia, most
   likely pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood, however continues to
   worsen with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second
   pathogen. Intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of
   breathing. CXR worse today with bilateral infiltrates.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Discontinue ceftaz, start meropenem and add back vancomycin.
   - Follow pan cultures
   - Will not be able to wean today
   - Bronch with BAL today
   - Continue Diuresis with lasix 10mg IV QID goal -2L
   - Will get chest CT with contrast to eval pleural effusions
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require sinus drainage
   #Hypotension:  Resolved.
    -Holding spironolactone
   - TTE no vegetation though suboptimal study.  In absence of fevers will
   not pursue TEE
   #Anemia- Likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of
   infection.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted for symptoms of malaise and cough. She was diagnosed with H. Flu and bacteremia, and is experiencing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient is intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. Her chest X-ray has worsened today.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension, but there is a concern for hyperchloremic hypotension. Measures have been taken to keep the systolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg.

2. Anemia: The patient likely has anemia of chronic disease with repeated blood draws. Her reticulocyte count is low, suggesting poor bone marrow response, possibly due to infection. Transfusion is planned for a hematocrit level below 21%, and an appropriate bump was given yesterday after one unit of packed red blood cells.

3. Constipation: The patient may be more constipated at baseline, but has only had small bowel movements and flatus while in the hospital. This morning, she had several large bowel movements, but an X-ray shows her bowel is full of stool. The current bowel regimen is being continued, and C. diff has been sent.

4. Depression: The patient's psychiatric medications, including Geodon, Prozac, and Ritalin, have been held while she is sedated.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF admitted for c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H. Flu +
   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure:  Likely post viral pneumonia, most
   likely pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood, however continues to
   worsen with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second
   pathogen. Intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of
   breathing. CXR worse today with bilateral infiltrates.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - Discontinue ceftaz, start meropenem and add back vancomycin.
   - Follow pan cultures
   - Will not be able to wean today
   - Bronch with BAL today
   - Continue Diuresis with lasix 10mg IV QID goal -2L
   - Will get chest CT with contrast to eval pleural effusions
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require sinus drainage
   #Hypotension:  Resolved.
    -Holding spironolactone
   - TTE no vegetation though suboptimal study.  In absence of fevers will
   not pursue TEE
   #Anemia- Likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of
   infection.
   -transfuse for HCT <21, appropritate bump to 23 yesterday after 1 uPRBC
   -[**Hospital1 **] HCT
   -Continue to monitor clinically for signs of bleeding.
   # Constipation- chronic issue, resolved
   - Continue aggressive bowel regimen
   - C diff sent
   #Depression
   -          Restarted Geodon, Prozac
   -          Hold Ritalin while sedated
   #Rash-likely related to head and pressure
   [**Hospital 427**] nursing care and monitor daily
   FEN: Continue Tube feeds and place on standing bowel regimen for BM,
   Replete lytes as needed

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute lung injury, pneumonia, and electrolyte/fluid disorder. The patient has been unable to extubate and has larger pleural effusions on a CT chest. Bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was done, and antibiotic coverage was changed to meropenem and vancomycin. Thoracentesis showed evidence of exudative effusion without organisms. Pressures dropped to the 80's systolic overnight after a bolus of fentanyl for sedation, but the patient's hematocrit (Hct) was lower at 21.9%, so one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused. The patient also received phos repletion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Inability to extubate: This can lead to prolonged mechanical ventilation, increased risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications such as barotrauma or volutrauma due to high airway pressures.
2. Pleural effusions: Large pleural effusions can cause respiratory distress and compromise gas exchange. They may require drainage to alleviate symptoms and prevent further complications.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia may worsen if not properly managed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care. It can lead to sepsis and multiorgan dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte/fluid disorder: The"

   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure on Day 9 of intubation:  Likely post
   viral pneumonia, most likely pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood,
   however continues to worsen with fevers after discontinuing
   vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second pathogen. Intubated and sedated for
   fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR worse today with bilateral
   infiltrates.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - continue Meropenem and Vanc (Day 1=[**12-13**])
   - Follow pan cultures
   - F/u BAL
   - Hold diuresis in setting of low pressures
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require sinus drainage-ENT consulted would like further imaging
   - Follow up Exhaled CO2 to get indication of dead space
   - Fevers may represent inflammatory reaction and not actual infection,
   will check CBC with diff, LFTs, [**Doctor First Name 293**]/Lip and treat with Tylenol if all
   negative
   #Transfusion reaction: 15 minutes into transfusion patient became
   hyperthermic to 101.4 from 99.2 and pressures were in 80s
   -          Stop and hold on transfusion
   -          Tylenol
   -          Benadryl
   #Hypotension: Worsened overnight in response to fentanyl.  Then
   continued in AM on propofol-may represent propofol infusion syndrome.
   Could also represent transfusion reaction,

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of malaise and cough. She was diagnosed with H. flu bacteremia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. She continues to worsen with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin, and there is evidence of a second pathogen. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications, including potential propofol infusion syndrome, suspected transfusion reaction, hypotension, anemia, constipation, depression, and rash.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Propofol infusion syndrome: The patient's hypotension worsened overnight in response to fentanyl, and continued in the morning on propofol. This could represent propofol infusion syndrome, which is a serious condition characterized by metabolic abnormalities and organ dysfunction.
2. Suspected transfusion reaction: The patient became hyperthermic shortly after starting a transfusion and her pressures were in the 80s. This raises concern for a transfusion reaction, which can manifest as fever, hypotension, and other symptoms.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to various factors such as sepsis, fluid loss, or medication effects. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
4. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, likely secondary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted with symptoms of malaise and cough. He was found to have H. Flu bacteremia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. He has developed fevers after discontinuing vancomycin and has worsening bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. The patient also experienced a transfusion reaction and hypotension, which may be related to propofol infusion syndrome or a transfusion reaction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening respiratory status and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest the possibility of ARDS. This condition can lead to severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has H. Flu bacteremia and ongoing fevers despite antibiotic therapy. There is a possibility of secondary infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Transfusion Reaction: The patient had a hyperthermic reaction during a blood transfusion, which could indicate a transfusion reaction. Further evaluation is needed to confirm this diagnosis.
4. Propofol Infusion Syndrome: The patient's hypotension may be related to propofol infusion syndrome, especially considering the worsening of symptoms overnight after receiving propofol. Monitoring for signs of this syndrome is essential.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF admitted for c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H. Flu +
   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure on s/p 9 days of intubation:  Likely
   post viral pneumonia with secondary bacterial infection, most likely
   pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood, however continues to worsen
   with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second pathogen.
   Intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR
   worse today with bilateral infiltrates.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - continue Meropenem and Vanc (Day 1=[**12-13**]), will discuss with ID
   discontinuing antibiotics
   - Follow pan cultures
   - F/u BAL
   - Discontinued diuresis in setting of low pressures, and autodiuresis
   - [**Month (only) 8**] require sinus drainage-ENT-no further imaging will re-consult as
   needed with nasal saline washes as needed
   - Fevers may represent inflammatory reaction and not actual infection,
   or may be related to transfusion
   -Recheck Amylase/Lipase in AM
   #Transfusion reaction: 15 minutes into transfusion patient became
   hyperthermic to 101.4 from 99.2 and pressures were in 80s-No further
   action needed.
   #Hypotension: Worsened overnight in response to fentanyl.  Then
   continued in AM on propofol-may represent propofol infusion syndrome.
   Could also represent transfusion reaction, though pressures stable
   today and approximately at patient
s baseline  MCVo2, lactate and CK
   wnl, LFT unremarkable.
   -Bolus as needed
   .
   #Anemia- Likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of
   infection-currently stable
   -transfuse for HCT <21
   -Daily HCT
   #Depression
   -          Restarted Geodon, Prozac

","The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted with malaise and cough for one week. She was diagnosed with H. flu bacteremia and continues to have respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and sedated due to fatigue and increased work of breathing. Her chest X-ray shows worsening bilateral infiltrates.

The patient's recent events include being extubated, receiving nasal saline washes for sinus drainage, discontinuing diuretics in the setting of low pressures, and autodiuresis. She also had a transfusion reaction and hypotension that worsened overnight in response to fentanyl.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 111/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is on CPAP/PSV with a set tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%.

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF admitted for c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H. Flu +
   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure on s/p 9 days of intubation:  Likely
   post viral pneumonia with secondary bacterial infection, most likely
   pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood, however continues to worsen
   with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second pathogen.
   Intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing. CXR
   worse today with bilateral infiltrates.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - continue Meropenem and Vanc (Day 1=[**12-13**]), will discuss with ID
   discontinuing antibiotics
   - Follow pan cultures
   - F/u BAL

","The patient is a 55-year-old female who was admitted for malaise and cough for one week. She was diagnosed with H. flu bacteremia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. The patient has been intubated and sedated for increased work of breathing. She has been on mechanical ventilation and has developed bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating worsening pneumonia.

The patient's fever persisted after discontinuing vancomycin, and a second pathogen was identified. The current plan is to continue meropenem and vancomycin (day 1=[12-13]), discuss with ID regarding antibiotic recommendations, follow pan cultures, and perform follow-up bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).

The patient also experienced a transfusion reaction during a blood transfusion, characterized by hyperthermia and low blood pressure. There were no further actions taken, and the patient's condition stabilized.

Additionally, the patient had hypotension that worsened overnight in response to fentanyl, and then continued during the day on propofol. This could represent propofol infusion syndrome or a transfusion reaction. The patient's cardiac output, lactate levels, and creatine kinase (CK) were within normal limits, making propofol infusion syndrome less likely.

The patient has anemia, likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of infection. She is currently stable, and daily hematocrit (HCT) monitoring is recommended.

The patient also has depression and a rash, which"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 YOF admitted for c/o malaise and cough for 1 week now has H. Flu +
   bacteremia and continuing respiratory failure secondary to ARDS.
   #ARDS/Hypoxic Respiratory failure on s/p 9 days of intubation:  Likely
   post viral pneumonia with secondary bacterial infection, most likely
   pathogen H. Flu as isolated from blood, however continues to worsen
   with fevers after discontinuing vancomycin.  [**Month (only) 8**] have second pathogen.
   Intubated and sedated for fatigue/increased work of breathing.
   - Appreciate ID recommendations
   - continue Meropenem, will discontinue Vancomycin (Day 1=[**12-13**]), plan to
   continue meropenem for total of 3 weeks
   - Follow pan cultures
   - F/u BAL
   - Discontinued diuresis in setting of low pressures, and autodiuresis,
   will consider restarting lasix may require lasix drip
   - ENT refused drainage at this time, however patient continues to have
   increased temps and increasing WBC may require reconsult, nasal saline
   washes as needed
   - Amylase/Lipase trending down
   - IGG subclasses per ID
   - Recheck c diff today per ID
   .
   #Hypotension: Worsened overnight in response to fentanyl.  Then
   continued in AM on propofol-may represent propofol infusion syndrome.
   Could also represent transfusion reaction, though pressures stable
   today and approximately at patient
s baseline  MCVo2, lactate and CK
   wnl, LFT unremarkable.
   -Bolus as needed

   #Anemia- Likely secondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of
   infection-currently stable

   #Depression
   -          Restarted Geodon, Prozac
   -          The patient does not want to restart ritalin

","The patient is a 55-year-old female admitted for malaise and cough for one week, now diagnosed with H. flu bacteremia and respiratory failure secondary to ARDS. She has been intubated and sedated for increased work of breathing. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure of 109/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's physical examination reveals increased work of breathing, dry mucous membranes, generalized edema improved from yesterday, and a macular confluent blanching rash on the lower portion of her back. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and albumin levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypotension, anemia, depression, and a rash. She is being treated with meropenem and pantoprazole, and is also receiving prophylactic heparin and pneumoboots. The patient's disposition is to stay in the ICU until stable. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, infection due to prolonged intubation, bleeding due to low platelet count and potential propofol infusion syndrome."
