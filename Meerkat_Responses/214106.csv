   Assessment and Plan
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   .
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic nor rigid.
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if rigidity increases
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h if symptoms recur
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - F/U Head CT final read
    - F/U LP results at OSH
   .
   #. ACS: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and an increase
   in TroponinI from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated and thus
   unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was started at
   OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival.
    - Continue heparin gtt
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given BP lability
    - F/U cardiology recs--much appreciated!
    - Continue to cycle enzymes at 0100 and 0900
    - Repeat EKG in am
    - Repeat TTE in am
   .
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH.
    - Repeat U/A
    - Hold ABx for now, as fever most likely [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome as no
   signs of active infection
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, which are consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient was started on Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine and no longer exhibits hyperthermia or rigidity.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Serotonin Syndrome: This is already present in the patient and requires close monitoring. If symptoms recur, Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h may be used.

2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has ST changes on ECG and an increased TroponinI level. Heparin gtt has been started, and cardiology consultation has been requested. The plan is to continue heparin gtt, defer on ASA due to unknown allergy, hold BB for BP lability, and follow cardiology recommendations.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient initially had a positive U/A at OSH, but cultures were contaminated. She was being treated with Ceftaz and Gentamicin at OSH. The plan is to repeat U/A and hold ABx for now, as fever is likely due to serotonin syndrome and no signs of active infection are present.

She was taking MAOI and Prozac together for six days, which led to the development of fatigue, weakness, and a fall at home. Upon evaluation, she presented with rigidity, myoclonus, fever, and was intubated for concern of serotonin syndrome. The patient was also given cyproheptadine/dantrolene/bromocryptine.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is Serotonin Syndrome. The patient has a history of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and was started on MAOI medication while still taking Prozac for depression. This combination of medications led to the development of fatigue, weakness, and a fall at home. Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was found to have rigidity and myoclonus, developed a fever of 108°F, and was intubated, sedated, and paralyzed due to concerns for Serotonin Syndrome. 

The patient was given cyproheptadine/dantrolene/bromocryptine for treatment. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed new 1 mm ST elevation in V4-V6, and cardiac enzymes showed elevated CK levels in the 4,000s and trop I went from 0.18 to 8.0 during hospitalization. The patient was transferred to the current facility for further care and possible catheterization.

The patient's vital signs upon arrival included a temperature of 96.5°F, blood pressure of 114/60 mmHg, heart rate of 119 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The ECG showed that the ST elevation had resolved, and there was flattening in V4-V6. A cardiology fellow decided to hold off on catheterization given the resolution of the ST elevation.

   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently

   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   .
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic nor rigid.
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if rigidity increases
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h if symptoms recur
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - F/U Head CT final read
    - F/U LP results at OSH
   .
   #. ACS: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and an increase
   in TroponinI from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated and thus
   unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was started at
   OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival.
    - Continue heparin gtt
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given BP lability
    - F/U cardiology recs--much appreciated!
    - Continue to cycle enzymes at 0100 and 0900
    - Repeat EKG in am
    - Repeat TTE in am

   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH.
    - Repeat U/A
    - Hold ABx for now, as fever most likely [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome as no
   signs of active infection

   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presents with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient was started on bromocriptine, dantrolene, and cyproheptadine. She is no longer hyperthermic or rigid. The patient also has altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus are consistent with serotonin syndrome. It is important to continue holding MAOI and SSRI medications. Restart vecuronium if rigidity increases, hold sedation for now to assess mental status, maintain O2 saturation > 93%, continue levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60, use cooling blankets for hyperthermia, avoid NSAIDs, and administer cyproheptadine if symptoms recur.

2. UTI: The patient had a positive U/A at OSH but cultures showed contamination. Repeat U/A and hold antibiotics for now since fever is more likely due to serotonin syndrome.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely due to underlying liver disease. Monitor platelets daily and consider platelet transfusion for platelets <"

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome.
- She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
- The patient was started on Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cyproheptadine due to suspected serotonin syndrome.
- She is no longer hyperthermic but still has rigidity.
- CK levels are downtrending.
- The patient has altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- She has a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Serotonin Syndrome:
- The patient is at risk for complications related to serotonin syndrome, such as hyperthermia, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities.
- Close monitoring of vital signs and neurologic status is essential.
- Maintaining oxygen saturation above 93% and avoiding NSAIDs are important considerations.

2. UTI:
- The patient may be at risk for further complications if the UTI is not properly managed.
- Frequent urinalysis and urine culture should be performed to identify any new pathogens or antibiotic resistance.
- Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results.

3. Thrombocytopenia"

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure of 96/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.6 g/dL, creatinine of 0.4 mg/dL, platelet count of 66 K/uL, and troponin-T of 1.11 ng/mL. The respiratory culture is pending, and no organisms were seen on the gram stain. 

The assessment and plan include continued monitoring for serotonin syndrome, holding MAOI and SSRI, restarting vecuronium if rigidity increases, holding sedation to assess mental status, maintaining oxygen saturation above 93%, continuing levophed as necessary to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, using cooling blankets for hyperthermia, avoiding NSAIDs, and administering cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h if symptoms recur.

For ACS, the patient should continue on heparin gtt, defer on ASA due to unknown allergy, hold beta-blockers due to blood pressure lability, repeat EKG in the morning, repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) in the morning, and follow up with cardiology recommendations. 

For UTI, a repeat urinalysis is needed, and antibiotics should be held as the fever is likely due to serotonin syndrome. 

Thrombocytopenia should be monitored daily, and platelet transfusion should be considered for platelets less than 50,000 with signs of active bleeding. 

Overall, the patient's conditions include serotonin syndrome, ACS, UTI, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status. The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of serotonin syndrome, progression of ACS, development of sepsis, and bleeding due to thrombocytopenia."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 74-year-old female with a history of depression, hepatitis C, and new diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. She was started on an MAOI and presented to the hospital with hyperthermia and rigidity, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient also had troponin elevation, unresponsiveness, and persistent poor mental status.

24-hour events include blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture being sent. An MRI of the head was ordered overnight, and heparin was stopped. The patient is on norepinephrine for hypotension and started on antibiotics.

The patient has allergies to aspirin and unknown medications. She is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy and unresponsiveness.

Infusions include norepinephrine and famotidine. Other ICU medications include ciproheptidine. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was piperacillin and vancomycin.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, normocephalic head, normal heart sounds, symmetric breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, trace lower extremity edema, and no skin changes. Neurologic examination shows the patient responds to noxious stimuli, moves extremities but remains rigid, and tone assessment is not evaluated.

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, elevated troponin T, and altered liver function tests. Other lab values are within"

1. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of hyperthermia, rigidity, and poor mental status are consistent with serotonin syndrome. This condition can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.
2. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The troponin elevation suggests possible cardiac involvement, indicating a potential ACS. Further evaluation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine appropriate management.
3. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension is concerning for sepsis, especially considering the presence of fever and potential infection. Monitoring and timely administration of appropriate antibiotics are crucial.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, daily spontaneous breathing trials, and regular culture surveillance should be implemented.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count indicates thrombocytopenia. Close monitoring of bleeding signs and symptoms is necessary. Platelet transfusion may be considered if there is active bleeding or a"

 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**].
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - F/U Head MRI
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check
   - neurology recs
   - f/u EEG result
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31).
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. ACS: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and an increase
   in TroponinI from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated and thus
   unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was started at
   OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later stopped.
   Changes were likely demand, however, EKG changed over weekend.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
    - F/U cardiology recs
    - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
    - Repeat EKG today
    - f/u echo results
    - check mixed venous O2 sat to check for cardiac component of
   hypotension
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH. Had a tx with vanco and zosyn initially.
    - f/u OSH cx
   - On Vanc Zosyn, UCx negative here, if neg at OSH would d/c abx.
   - Vanc trough today at 8:30p
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct
    - f/u on haptoglobin

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presents with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, which are consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient was started on Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine, but still has rigidity. Her CK levels are downtrending.

The patient also has altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). She has been treated with various medications and interventions, including antibiotics, pressors, and cardiac medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include worsening of serotonin syndrome, development of further infections, progression of ACS, and potential bleeding events due to thrombocytopenia."

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, CHRONIC
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**].
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs though temps have been
   normal.
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - Head MRI notable for cerebral atrophy, but no other notable lesions
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check- continue to trend down
   - neurology recs
   - f/u EEG result
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31).
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
   - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH. Tx w/ vanco and zosyn here for empiric coverage. Ucx
   here NGTD. Will continue to tx until OSH negative
    - f/u OSH cx
   - On Vanc Zosyn, UCx negative here, if neg at OSH would d/c abx.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct

","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, Hepatitis C, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status (not delirium), urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

1. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient's symptoms are consistent with serotonin syndrome, which can occur due to the use of MAOIs and SSRIs. She was started on bromocriptine, dantrolene, and cyproheptadine. Although hyperthermia has resolved, rigidity persists. CK levels are downtrending, and CSF from OSH NGTD is pending.

2. Anemia: The patient's acute HCT drop was likely secondary to bleeding into the thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. The patient's HCT improved appropriately with 2U pRBCs (25 -> 31).

3. Demand Ischemia: The patient had ST changes on ECG and an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7. The patient was intubated and unable to verbalize potential chest pain. Heparin gtt was started at OSH, and cardiology was called upon arrival. Heparin was later stopped. Cardiac findings were consistent with demand ischemia"

   Probably related to persistent metabolites of MAOI/SSRI. F/u EEG, and
   LP results. Continue to hold sedatives.
 Serotonin syndrome:
   Ck trending down, fever resolved. Continue cyproheptadine prn. No
   current need for paralytics. Appreciated neurology and psychiatry
   input.
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   Obtain Osh data. If negative will stop current antibiotics
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, CHRONIC
   Likely secondary to liver disease. Check smear. Will transfuse if hct
   continuing to drop and plt count<50.
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   Appreciated cardiology recommendation. Likely demand event. Echo with
   no WMA. Holding bblocker while on pressors. Holding ASA due to
   thrombocytopenia.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is serotonin syndrome and positive cardiac markers. The patient is unresponsive and unable to provide a medical history. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy and has received various antibiotics. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 109/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 602 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 10 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 47.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube, NG tube, and scabbed lesions on lips. The cardiovascular examination shows normal PMI (point of maximal impulse), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, and bilateral radial and dorsal pulses. The respiratory examination reveals symmetric chest expansion and rhonchorous breath sounds. The abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender abdomen with diminished bowel sounds. The extremities show trace edema in both lower extremities"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has a history of altered mental status, which is not due to delirium, likely related to persistent metabolites of MAOI/SSRI. Serotonin syndrome is being managed with cyproheptadine and no current need for paralytics. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and thrombocytopenia, likely secondary to liver disease. 

The patient experienced an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with unstable angina and coronary ischemia. An echocardiogram showed no wall motion abnormality (WMA), and beta-blockers and aspirin were withheld due to the patient's thrombocytopenia. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and 1 liter of intravenous fluid (IVF) for anemia likely related to a thigh bleed. Heparin has been held, and the patient's hematocrit (Hct) is being monitored.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Fibersource HN (Full) at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Glycemic control is well-managed within the range of 100-140. The patient has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line inserted on September 5th. Prophylaxis measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with boots, stress ulcer prevention"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of serotonin syndrome and positive cardiac markers. They have been unresponsive and unable to provide their medical history. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, FiO2 at 50%, PEEP at 5 cmH2O, and RSBI of 47. Their vital signs include a temperature of 37.3 C (99.2 F), heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/54 to 131/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. They have a central venous pressure of 11 mmHg, mixed venous oxygen saturation of 80%, and fluid balance within normal limits. The patient has received multiple blood transfusions and has a history of thigh hematoma, for which they received 2 units of packed red blood cells and 1 liter of fresh frozen plasma. 

Medical Complications:
1. Serotonin syndrome: The patient is exhibiting symptoms of serotonin syndrome, likely due to the interaction between MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). This condition is characterized by altered mental status, autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular abnormalities. The patient's rigidity and tracking behavior may indicate this syndrome.
2. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's positive cardiac markers suggest the possibility of"

   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
    # VAP:
   - Vanc
   - Cefepime
   - ? flagyl
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**].
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs though temps have been
   normal.
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - Head MRI notable for cerebral atrophy, but no other notable lesions
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check- continue to trend down
   - neurology recs
   - f/u EEG result
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31).
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
   - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH. Tx w/ vanco and zosyn here for empiric coverage. Ucx
   here NGTD. Will continue to tx until OSH negative
    - f/u OSH cx
   - On Vanc Zosyn, UCx negative here, if neg at OSH would d/c abx.
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presents with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sedation, pneumonia (pna), or serotonin syndrome. Appropriate measures such as fluid boluses, antibiotic therapy, and placement of an arterial line should be continued.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has been fighting the ventilator in the morning and required sedation and assisted ventilation. Close monitoring of arterial blood gases (ABG), continuing assisted ventilation, and possibly placing an arterial line are recommended.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Although the patient had a positive urine analysis at OSH, cultures were contaminated. She was being treated with ceftazidime and gentamicin at OSH, and empiric coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is being continued here. Cultures from OSH have been negative, and local cultures are also negative. It is important to continue antibiotic therapy until OSH cultures are negative.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely related to underlying liver disease. Her platelets are currently at her baseline. Daily monitoring of platelets is advised"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation and has an increased requirement for oxygen, which raises concerns for VAP. The plan includes increasing PEEP, performing low tidal volume ventilation, sending sputum culture, and considering bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to assess for secretions.

2. Serotonin syndrome: The patient is on cyproheptadine, and there are signs of temperature, hypertension, and rigidity, which are suggestive of serotonin syndrome. The patient's temperature and rigidity have responded to the increased dose of cyproheptadine.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which is chronic and stable. However, it needs to be monitored closely, especially with the presence of a thigh bleed.

4. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient may have unstable angina or coronary ischemia. There is a mention of demand ischemia off heparin, indicating a possible need for further evaluation and treatment.

5. Hypoxemia: The patient has increased ventilator requirements, suggesting inadequate oxygenation. This needs to be managed appropriately with adjustments in ventilation settings and possibly considering alternative oxygen sources.

6. Thigh bleed: The patient has a thigh bleed, and the hemoglobin"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The patient has a history of altered mental status, serotonin syndrome, thrombocytopenia, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), hypoxemia, thigh bleed, and chronic thrombocytopenia. The patient is intubated, sedated, and on mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 70% and PEEP of 10 cmH2O. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 99/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14.2 K/uL, an elevated troponin T level of 0.67 ng/mL, and a decreased platelet count of 65 K/uL. The patient is receiving multiple medications including propofol, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, famotidine, and cyproheptadine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's increased ventilator requirement and hypoxemia raise concern for the development of VAP. Measures such as increasing PEEP, performing low tidal volume ventilation"

","The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and sedated. The patient's temperature is elevated, indicating a fever. The patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate are within normal limits, but the patient requires supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is low, indicating a possible fluid imbalance. The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin and an unknown allergy. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Cefepime, and Vancomycin.

The patient's physical examination reveals pale conjunctiva, symmetric chest expansion with diminished breath sounds on the left anterior side, and edema in both lower extremities. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.2, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 65, and elevated levels of troponin-T, lactate, and creatine kinase-MB. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for low potassium levels. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis shows a slightly elevated pH and decreased oxygen saturation.

The patient has been diagnosed with altered mental status, serotonin syndrome, thrombocytopenia, acute coronary syndrome, hypoxemia, and a thigh bleed. The patient is being treated with propofol for sedation, cyproheptadine for serotonin syndrome, vancomycin and c"

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, CHRONIC
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
    #. HAP: Evolving infiltrate on CXR.  Sputum sample ? contaminated
   though taken from ET tube.
   - continue vanco/cefepime
   - bolus as need for MAP< 60
   #. Respiratory distress: Figthing ventilator this AM. Sedated and
   placed back on AC.
   - monitor ABG
   - continue AC
   - likely needs a-line
   #. Hypotension: ? sedation vs pna vs serotonin syndrome
   - continue fluid boluses
   - continue abx
   - place a-line
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**].
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs though temps have been
   normal.
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - Head MRI notable for cerebral atrophy, but no other notable lesions
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check- continue to trend down
   - neurology recs
   - f/u EEG result
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31). Now stable and not advancing.
   - daily hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
   - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH. Tx w/ vanco and zosyn here for empiric coverage. Ucx
   here NGTD. Will continue to tx until OSH negative
    -  OSH cx negative
   -  cultures here negative
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, Hepatitis C, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presents with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome. 

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that require attention:

1. HAP (Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia): The patient has an evolving infiltrate on chest X-ray, but some improvement is noted. No growth on cultures. Vancomycin trough was 7.8, unclear if the patient missed a dose. The plan is to continue vancomycin and cefepime for an 8-day course, bolus as needed for MAP < 60, wean neosyn, and recheck trough.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is sedated on AC (Assisted Control). Less likely PE (Pulmonary Embolism), as the lower extremity venous Doppler (LENI) negative. PNA (Pneumonia) seems like the most likely cause of respiratory distress. The plan is to monitor ABG (Arterial Blood Gas), continue AC, and consider other causes if no improvement.

3. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, possibly due to sedation, PNA, or serotonin syndrome. The plan is to continue fluid boluses, continue antibiotics, place an arterial line, and assess for other potential causes.

4. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient presented with hyperthermia, posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor) and SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) use. The patient was started on Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine. Although the hyperthermia has resolved, the patient still has rigidity, and CK (Creatine Kinase) levels are downtrending. CSF from OSH NGTD on [**2150-9-7**]. The plan is to continue cyproheptadine, restart vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs, hold sedation for now, maintain O2 saturation > 93%, continue vent settings, use cooling blankets as needed, avoid NSAIDs, aim to keep CVP 8-12, and monitor for further improvement.

5. ABD Distention: The patient has abdominal distention likely due to constipation. The plan is to administer senna and docusate.

6. Anemia: The patient had an acute drop in hematocrit, which was suspected to be secondary to bleeding into the thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. The patient's hematocrit improved appropriately with 2 units of packed red blood cells (25-31). The plan is to maintain T&S and monitor daily hematocrit levels.

 [**Last Name 12**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, CHRONIC
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
    #. VAP: Evolving infiltrate on CXR.  Likely has VAP, had bronch with
   mucus plug on [**9-9**], CXR improved today
   - continue vanco/cefepime for 8 day course
   - bolus as need for MAP< 60
   #. Respiratory distress: Fighting ventilator this AM. Sedated and
   placed back on AC.
   - monitor ABG
   - continue AC
   #. Hypotension: ? sedation vs pna vs serotonin syndrome
   - continue on low dose levo
   - continue fluid boluses
   - continue abx
   - place a-line
   # AMS: neuro following, difficulty waking up
   - EEG results
   -  consider LP once no longer having bleeding
   - neuro recs
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**].
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
   - Head MRI notable for cerebral atrophy, but no other notable lesions
   - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check
   - neurology recs
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31). Now stable and not advancing.
   - [**Hospital1 7**] hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
    - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   #. UTI:  The patient was found to have a positive U/A at OSH but
   cultures were c/w contamination.  She was being treated with Ceftaz and
   Gentamicin at OSH. Tx w/ vanco and zosyn here for empiric coverage. Ucx
   here NGTD. Will continue to tx until OSH negative
    -  OSH cx negative
   -  cultures here negative
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct
   # Constipation: no BM
   - place on senna, colace, and bisacodyl

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presents with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has an evolving infiltrate on CXR and is likely to have VAP. She should continue on vancomycin and cefepime for an 8-day course, receive boluses as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 60, and be monitored for ABG.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient is fighting the ventilator and may require sedation and reintubation on assist-control ventilation (AC).
3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to sedation, pneumonia, or serotonin syndrome. She should continue on low-dose levo, receive fluid boluses, continue antibiotics, and have an arterial line placed.
4. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient has difficulty waking up and may have AMS. Neurological follow-up is recommended, along with an EEG and lumbar puncture once bleeding stops.
5. Serotonin syndrome: The patient presented with hyperthermia, posturing, and rigidity, and was treated with bromocriptine, dantrolene, and cyproheptadine. She is no longer hyperthermic but"

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)/serotonin syndrome:
   obtain EEG today, will defer LP due to thrombocytopenia, presence of
   concomitant pulmonary infection, and need for sedation and altered MS
   likely explained by delirium/sedation. Doubt hospital aquired bacterial
   meningitis and prior LP was negative at OSH, and she is currently on
   therapy. d/c fentanyl for neuroexam. Decrease frequency of
   cyclohepatidine per neuro 8 q6.
 Nutrition:
   high residual this am, start senna/colace, restart tube feeds at lower
   rate.
 VAP: sputum culture negative todate but clear infiltrate on CXR. On

   Assessment and Plan
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)/serotonin syndrome:
   obtain EEG today, will defer LP due to thrombocytopenia, presence of
   concomitant pulmonary infection, and need for sedation and altered MS
   likely explained by delirium/sedation. Doubt hospital acquired
   bacterial meningitis and prior LP was negative at OSH, and she is
   currently on therapy. d/c fentanyl for neuroexam. Decrease frequency of
   cyclohepatidine per neuro 8 q6.
 Nutrition:
   high residual this am, start senna/colace, restart tube feeds at lower
   rate.
 VAP: sputum culture negative today but clear infiltrate on CXR. On
   vanco/cefepime x 8 days. r/a need for bronch today. send gas, wean
   FiO2, and PEEP as tolerated.
 Hypotension: Bp improved, continue to monitor urine output, bolus as
   necessary and levophed to keep MAP >65.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient's medical history includes altered mental status, serotonin syndrome, VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia), hypotension, and poor urine output. The patient is currently on multiple medications including fentanyl, levophed, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, cefepime, heparin, and famotidine.

The patient's vital signs show a fever, tachycardia, and borderline blood pressure. The respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) mode, assisting spontaneous breaths, and automatic flow. The oxygen delivery device is an endotracheal tube, and the FiO2 is set at 70%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 31 mmHg, PaO2 of 87, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute.

The patient's physical examination reveals edematous and anasarca appearance, with bilateral lower extremity edema. The neurologic assessment indicates that the patient responds to noxious stimuli and shows non-purposeful movements with normal tone.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 11.2 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 60 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU. The patient's urine output has been poor, with borderline blood pressure and the need for levophed (a medication used to increase blood pressure). The patient also has a fever that was addressed by administering Tylenol. Bronchial plugs were found in the lingula, and an EEG and LP (lumbar puncture) have been recommended by neurology. The patient is unable to provide their own medical history as they are sedated.

The patient has allergies to aspirin and an unknown allergy. Antibiotics were administered including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Cefepime. Infusions include norepinephrine, fentanyl, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Other medications include famotidine, heparin subcutaneously, albuterol, fentanyl, and cyproheptadine.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 131/56 to 194/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 5,313 mL with outputs of 931 mL through the gastrointestinal tract, 394 mL through IV fluids, and 490 mL through urine"

 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, CHRONIC
 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   #. Respiratory distress: On CXR today pt has new bilateral fluffy
   infiltrates concerning for pulmonary edema versus ARDS. ABG this am
   showed poor oxygenation, PEEP was increased, FIO2 and TV increased,
   sedation increased , repeat ABG sent. Lasix given
   - likely will need more diuresis, will start lasix gtt, goal 50ml
   negative per hour
   - monitor ABG
   - continue AC
   - will keep on increased fentanyl, if not suff. will add versed
   - today will try to wean PEEP first
    #. HAP: Evolving infiltrate on CXR, but some improvement on today
   CXR.  No growth on cultures. Vanco trough was 13 today, but not high
   enough for VAP tx
   - continue vanco/cefepime for 8 day course, will increase dose to
   1.25gm Q12
   - bolus as need for MAP< 60
   - wean levo if possible
   - recheck trough vanco in AM goal >20
   #. Hypotension: ? sedation vs pna vs serotonin syndrome vs parkinsons
   disease related autoregulaion deffect
   - continue fluid boluses
   - continue abx
   - levo as needed
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**]. same amount of rigidity today.
    - Continue cyproteptadine
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs though temps have been
   normal.
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid
    - Aim to keep CVP 8-12
    - Head MRI notable for cerebral atrophy, but no other notable lesions
    - [**Hospital1 7**] CK check
    - neurology recs
    - f/u EEG result once complete
   # Abd distention: Likely due to constipation.
   - Senna
   - Docusate
   - will add lacutlose this PM if needed
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31). Now stable.
   - daily hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
   - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   - check EKG today
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding
    - will check PM hct

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has new bilateral fluffy infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which is concerning for pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's ABG showed poor oxygenation, so the PEEP was increased, FiO2 and TV were increased, sedation was increased, and another ABG was sent. Lasix was given to manage fluid balance and improve oxygenation.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has an evolving infiltrate on the chest X-ray, but cultures have shown no growth. Vancomycin trough levels were not high enough for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) treatment. The plan is to continue vancomycin and cefepime for an 8-day course, increase the dose of vancomycin, bolus as needed for mean arterial pressure (MAP) < 60, wean levo if possible, and recheck trough vancomycin levels in the morning with a goal of >20.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to sedation, pneumonia, serotonin syndrome, or autoregulation defects related to Parkinson's disease. The plan includes continuing fluid boluses, continuing antibiotics, and adjusting levo (a vasopressor) as needed.

4. Serotonin syndrome: The patient presented with hyperthermia, posturing, and rig"

   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is downtrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**]. More rigid today than on prior days.
    - Continue cyproteptadine
    - Continue to hold MAOI and SSRI
    - Restart Vecuronium if hyperthermia reoccurs though temps have been
   normal.
    - Hold sedation for now, in order to assess mental status
    - Continue to maintain O2 sat > 93%, continue vent settings
    - Continue Levophed as necessary to maintain MAP > 60
    - Use cooling blankets as needed for hyperthermia.  Avoid NSAIDs
    - Use Cyproheptadine 2 mg q2h until no longer rigid

   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in

","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has new bilateral fluffy infiltrates on the chest X-ray, which is concerning for pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's ABG showed poor oxygenation, and PEEP was increased. It is important to continue monitoring the ABG and repeat it. The patient may require more diuretics, and it is necessary to continue acute care.

2. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient has an evolving infiltrate on the chest X-ray, but there has been some improvement today. There is no growth on cultures, and vancomycin trough was 7.8, with uncertainty about whether the patient missed a dose. It is recommended to continue vancomycin and cefepime for an 8-day course, provide bolus doses for mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 60, wean neosynephrine, recheck trough levels, and continue antibiotic therapy.

3. Hypotension: The cause of the patient's hypotension is uncertain, with possibilities including sedation, pneumonia, or serotonin syndrome. It is suggested to continue fluid boluses, continue antibiotics, and reassess the situation.

4. Serotonin syndrome: The patient presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and posturing, which were consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient was started on bromocri"

2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has an evolving infiltrate on chest X-ray, but there is some improvement. No growth has been observed on cultures. Vancomycin trough levels were 7.8, with uncertainty regarding whether the patient missed a dose. 

3. Hypotension: The cause of hypotension is unclear, possibly due to sedation, pneumonia, or serotonin syndrome. Fluid boluses and antibiotics have been continued.

4. Serotonin Syndrome: The patient initially presented with hyperthermia, posturing, and rigidity, and was started on Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cyproheptadine. She is no longer hyperthermic but still has rigidity. CK levels are downtrending. CSF from OSH NGTD was done on [**2150-9-7**]. She is more"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is serotonin syndrome, shock, and respiratory failure. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history. The patient has been experiencing increased frothy secretions from the endotracheal tube, hypoxemia, and low urine output. 

The patient is currently receiving several medications including fentanyl, norepinephrine, heparin sodium, famotidine, furosemide, and cycloheptadine. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 bpm, hypotension with blood pressure ranging from 125/55 mmHg to 134/60 mmHg, and respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 92%. 

The patient has a history of allergies to aspirin and unknown medications. The last doses of antibiotics given were vancomycin at 10:10 PM on 09/10 and cefepime at 06:25 AM on 09/11. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, slightly low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and altered electrolyte levels including low sodium, potassium, and calcium. Blood cultures have shown no growth. 

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles in the left bronchus, edema in both lower extremities, decreased bowel sounds, and unresponsiveness with non-purposeful movements.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome. She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient's medical complications include hypotension, respiratory distress, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, and pulmonary edema/ARDS.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing both septic and cardiogenic shock, with recent NSTEMI. Hypotension can lead to inadequate blood flow to vital organs, causing organ dysfunction or failure.

2. Respiratory distress: The patient has new bilateral fluffy infiltrates on CXR, concerning for pulmonary edema versus ARDS. ARDS is a severe lung condition that can lead to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Complications of ARDS include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.

3. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): ACS refers to a spectrum of conditions including unstable angina and myocardial infarction. Complications of ACS can include heart attack, heart failure, arrhythmias, and even death if not promptly treated.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): UTIs can ascend from the bladder to the kidneys, leading to pyelonephritis, which can"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including depression, HepC, and Parkinson's syndrome. She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, which are consistent with serotonin syndrome. The patient has been experiencing hypotension and respiratory distress, and despite interventions such as increasing PEEP and administering bicarbonate, her condition has worsened.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation (SpO2: 93%) indicate a possibility of ARDS. This is further supported by the presence of bilateral rhonchi on chest examination.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing VAP. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings should be monitored closely for any signs of infection.

3. Sepsis and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS): Given the patient's compromised immune system due to HepC, she is at an increased risk of developing sepsis and SIRS. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial.

4. Hepatic Encephalopathy: As the patient has a history of HepC, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy due to liver dysfunction. This can present with altered mental status, confusion, and other"

   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   #. Respiratory distress: On CXR today pt has new bilateral fluffy
   infiltrates concerning for pulmonary edema versus ARDS. ABG yesterday
   showed poor oxygenation, PEEP was increased, later pt found to have rt
   pneumothorax, chest tube was placed. Overnight pt resisted vent
   settings, required large amounts of secreations. And  FIO2 of 100%.
   This was likely due to large amounts of pulmonary edema and attemts at
   diruetics were ineffective.
   - continue vent settings until family meeting to discuss withdrawal of
   care
    #. HAP: Evolving infiltrate on CXR, but some improvement on today
   CXR.  No growth on cultures. Vanco trough elevated
   - continue vanco/cefepime for 8 day course,  for now
   #. Hypotension: Likely now due to both spesis and cardiogenic shock,
   with recent NSTEMI.
   - will check CEs and EKG
   - continue pressors
   - continue abx
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is uptrending. CSF from OSH

   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later

 ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS, UNSTABLE ANGINA, CORONARY ISCHEMIA)
   The patient is a 74 yo woman with h/o depression, HepC, and recently
   diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome, who presents with hyperthermia,
   rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
   #. Respiratory distress: On CXR today pt has new bilateral fluffy
   infiltrates concerning for pulmonary edema versus ARDS. ABG yesterday
   showed poor oxygenation, PEEP was increased, later pt found to have rt
   pneumothorax, chest tube was placed. Overnight pt resisted vent
   settings, required large amounts of secreations. And  FIO2 of 100%.
   This was likely due to large amounts of pulmonary edema and attemts at
   diruetics were ineffective.
   - continue vent settings until family meeting to discuss withdrawal of
   care
    #. HAP: Evolving infiltrate on CXR, but some improvement on today
   CXR.  No growth on cultures. Vanco trough elevated
   - continue vanco/cefepime for 8 day course,  for now
   #. Hypotension: Likely now due to both spesis and cardiogenic shock,
   with recent NSTEMI.
   - will check CEs and EKG
   - continue pressors
   - continue abx
   #. Serotonin Syndrome:  The patient presented with hyperthermia,
   posturing, and rigidity in the setting of MAOI and SSRI use.  This was
   thought to be [**2-9**] serotonin syndrome, so the patient was started on
   Bromocriptine, Dantrolene, and Cryoheptadine.  She is no longer
   hyperthermic but still has rigidity.  CK is uptrending. CSF from OSH
   NGTD on [**2150-9-7**]. same amount of rigidity today.
   - will discuss goals of care with family
   # Abd distention: Likely due to constipation.
   - Senna
   - Docusate
   - will add lacutlose this PM if needed
   # Anemia: Suspect that acute hct drop was secondary to bleeding into
   thigh after heparin gtt and elevated INR. Pt's hct improved
   appropriately with 2u pRBCs (25->31). Now stable.
   - daily hct
   - Maintain T+S
   #. Demand Ischemia: The patient was found to have ST changes on ECG and
   an increase in Troponin I from 0.14 to 8.7.  The patient was intubated
   and thus unable to verbalize potential chest pain.  Heparin gtt was
   started at OSH, and cardiology was C/S upon arrival, heparin later
   stopped. Cards felt  findings were consistent with demand ischemia in
   setting of hyperthermia and rigidity.  No need for further cardiac
   management. ECHO without evidence of wall motion abnormalities.
    - Defer on ASA, as the patient has unknown allergy
    - Continue to hold BB given pressor requirment
   - trending CK for serotonin syndrome
   - check EKG today
   # Thrombocytopenia:  The patient has thrombocytopenia, likely [**2-9**]
   underlying liver disease.  Her platelets are currently at her baseline.
    - Continue to monitor platelets daily
    - Transfuse for platelets < 50 with signs of active bleeding

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a history of depression, HepC, and recently diagnosed Parkinson's syndrome.
- She presented with hyperthermia, rigidity, and clonus, consistent with serotonin syndrome.
- The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, heart failure (CHF), coagulopathy, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, urinary tract infection (UTI), thrombocytopenia, and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
- She developed bilateral fluffy infiltrates on chest X-ray, indicating pulmonary edema or ARDS.
- The patient resisted ventilator settings and required high amounts of oxygen due to large amounts of pulmonary edema.
- A chest tube was placed to manage a right pneumothorax.
- The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis and cardiogenic shock, with recent NSTEMI.
- Serotonin syndrome was initially suspected and treated, but the patient still exhibits rigidity.
- The patient's anemia improved after receiving packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
- She experienced ischemia and had ST changes on ECG and elevated Troponin I levels.
- Cardiology determined that the findings were consistent with demand ischemia, possibly related to hyperthermia and rigidity.
- The patient has chronic thrombocytopenia, likely related to underlying liver disease.
- The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening acidosis and respiratory distress"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a complicated ICU course, presenting with serotonin syndrome due to an interaction between SSRI and MAOI. The patient has experienced various medical complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), renal failure, volume overload, coagulopathy, and most recently, barotrauma resulting in the placement of a pigtail catheter. The patient's respiratory status is declining, and the family has made the decision not to escalate care but to move towards comfort measures only (CMO) when the remainder of the family arrives.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has a history of VAP, which is a common complication in mechanically ventilated patients. It is caused by the inhalation of bacteria into the lungs, leading to infection.

2. Renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, indicated by abnormal laboratory values such as elevated creatinine and BUN levels. This may be due to factors such as dehydration, medication use, or sepsis.

3. Volume overload: The patient is experiencing volume overload, as evidenced by the excessive fluid intake and inadequate urine output. This can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, evident from the prolonged PT/PTT/INR values. This can increase the risk of bleeding complications.

5. Barotrauma:"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 70-year-old female with a complicated ICU course. She has been diagnosed with serotonin syndrome due to the interaction of SSRI and MAOI medications. The patient has experienced various medical complications including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), renal failure, volume overload, coagulopathy, and most recently, right-sided pulmonary thromxembolism (R-PTX), for which a pigtail catheter was placed. The patient's respiratory status has been declining, and the family has made the decision not to escalate care and move towards comfort measures only (CMO) when the remainder of the family arrives.

24-hour events include low oxygen saturation levels, dysynchronous ventilation requiring high levels of sedation, diuresis attempts with little improvement, tachycardia, worsening acidemia, and no EKG changes.

Infusions include midazolam (Versed) at 8 mg/hour, vasopressin at 2.4 units/hour, and fentanyl at 200 mcg/hour. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix), sodium bicarbonate, and changes in medical and family history.

Flow sheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory results. The patient's temperature is 38.2°C, heart rate is 112 bpm, blood pressure is 101/51 mmHg, respiratory rate is 23 breaths per minute"
