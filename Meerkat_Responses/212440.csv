   Hypotension, presumptive cardiac in the setting of low ef and rapid
   afib
   Leukocytosis, leg cellulitis the most likely source
   Atrial fibrillation
   LFT abnormalities- suspect hepatic congestion
   Elevated INR
   Appreciate input from cardiology consult team. He needs diuresis,
   though this may be difficult given borderline BP. Will wean oxygen as
   tolerated and check ABG to assess current level of hypoxia. Loss of
   atrial kick further compromsing cardiac function and forward flow- plan
   Amiodarone load and lasix as tolerated. Suspect the elevated INR more
   from malnutrition as n

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted with hypoxia, leukocytosis, and peripheral edema. He has a history of progressive dyspnea on exertion for the past year, which has recently worsened. The patient underwent hernia repair surgery and developed acute respiratory distress, biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 20%, atrial fibrillation, and hypotension. He also has leukocytosis, leg cellulitis, elevated liver function tests, and an elevated INR. The patient is critically ill and requires further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation and acute respiratory distress indicate potential hypoxemia. This could be due to pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, or small pulmonary embolism.
2. Cardiac Failure: The patient's biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 20% suggests decompensated heart failure. This may contribute to his hypoxia and hypotension.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in rapid atrial fibrillation, which further compromises cardiac function and forward flow.
4. Leg Cellulitis: The patient's leukocytosis and leg edema with cellulitis suggest a possible bacterial infection. This needs to be treated promptly to prevent worsening of the condition.
5. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient's elevated liver function tests may indicate hep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. He has multiple comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, chronic pain, congestive heart failure, and possible congestive hepatopathy. He is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring of his respiratory status and tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to underlying heart conditions such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism.
2. Pneumonia progression and sepsis.
3. Cellulitis worsening and potential development of necrotizing fasciitis.
4. Continued hypoxia and respiratory distress.
5. Complications related to atrial fibrillation, such as stroke or thromboembolism.
6. Liver dysfunction and synthetic failure due to congestive hepatopathy or hepatitis.
7. Renal impairment due to hypotension and inadequate perfusion.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and further risk of pulmonary embolism.

Please note that this is a summary of the patient's current condition and potential complications. The actual clinical scenario may vary, and further evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate diagnosis and management."

   process on CT. Also possible would be PA HTN, either primary or
   secondary to recurrent pulmonary emboli.  Left heart failure in the
   setting of tachycardia leading to R heart failure is also possible,
   although less likely given unimpressive lung exam and CT.
   - TTE in AM to evaluate cardiac function further including estimating
   PA pressures
   - obtain old TTE records from [**Hospital 11607**]

   disease as above, L heart failure,pneumonia, PE.  No known history of
   cardiac disease apart from HTN, but he may have developed failure in
   the setting of poor tolerance of rapid rate.  Regarding the possibility
   of pneumonia, he does have consolidation on CT had significant
   leukocytosis with left shift as well as an increase in sputum
   production, although afebrile. PE of this size unlikely to be
   contributing.
   - TTE in the AM to evaluate EF

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. He has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), cellulitis, hypotension, elevated liver function tests, and a suspected left atrial filling defect.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Heart Failure: The patient appears to have right-sided heart failure, as indicated by extensive subcutaneous edema. This can lead to poor circulation of blood in the body and may result in further complications.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF, which increases the risk of blood clot formation. This can potentially lead to stroke or other embolic events if not properly managed.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has consolidation on CT scan and leukocytosis with increased sputum production, indicating possible pneumonia. If left untreated, this can progress and lead to sepsis or respiratory failure.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the CT scan did not show any obvious interstitial process, there is a concern for PE due to the patient's hypoxia and AF. A PE can cause significant respiratory distress and even death if not promptly treated.

5. Cellulitis: The patient has evidence of cellulitis, which is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. If not"

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year-old man with a history of hypertension who
   presents with progressive dyspnea, evidence of R heart failure, and
   hypoxia.
   .
   # Right heart failure:  Clinically, patient appears to have R>L heart
   failure given extensive subcutaneous edema without crackles or severe
   pulmonary edema on CT scan.  Differential includes cor pulmonale
   secondary to intrinsic lung disease.  However, no obvious interstitial
   process on CT. Also possible would be PA HTN, either primary or
   secondary to recurrent pulmonary emboli.  Left heart failure in the
   setting of tachycardia leading to R heart failure is also possible,
   although less likely given unimpressive lung exam and CT.
   - TTE in AM to evaluate cardiac function further including estimating
   PA pressures
   - obtain old TTE records from [**Hospital 11607**]
   - control HR as below
   - will need diuresis after BP stabilizes (holding off for tonight given
   tenuous BP and need for diltiazem gtt, as below)
   # hypoxia:  Differential includes primary interstitial or vascular lung
   disease as above, L heart failure,pneumonia, PE.  No known history of
   cardiac disease apart from HTN, but he may have developed failure in
   the setting of poor tolerance of rapid rate.  Regarding the possibility
   of pneumonia, he does have consolidation on CT had significant
   leukocytosis with left shift as well as an increase in sputum
   production, although afebrile. PE of this size unlikely to be
   contributing.
   - TTE in the AM to evaluate EF
   - diuresis may be helpful when tolerated to eliminate improve fluid
   component
   - broad-spectrum antibioitics with vancomycin and zosyn for possible
   PNA
   - continue heparin gtt for now until it is more clear whether PE may be
   contributing (also has afib and ? LAA clot so needs anticoagulation
   anyway)
   - sputum cultures
   - blood cultures
   - urine cultures
   .
   # Hypotension:  Differential includes distributive vs cardiogenic
   shock.  Could have distributive shock from sepsis-like picture.
   However, rapid HR and the CCB that he has been given to control HR are
   likely large contributing factors as well.
   - blood, urine, sputum cultures
   - treat
   - continue IVF (gingerly) or low threshold to start levophed to
   maintain MAP >65, UOP >65 cc/h, CVP 8-12
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Cause may be underlying septic process vs
   primary tachycardia related to septic picture.  Not therapeutically
   anticoagulated, although INR elevated not After 10 mg IV diltiazem
   followed by diltiazem gtt (initially at 15 mg/h, now at 5 mg/h), rate
   control is improved. afib - got 10 IV dilt, now on HR 100 on dilt gtt
   at 5 (15 at highest).  Also got 1.5 L IVF.  Pressures 90s-100s
   systolic.
   - amio gtt to finish this afternoon
 will start PO
   # LE cellulitis: likely initiated by burn injury, now worsening
   secondary to subcutaneous edema
   - vancomycin and zosyn
   - blood cultures
   .
   # PNA:  appears to be infiltrate on CT rather than simply atelectasis
   around effusion.  Afebrile but leukocytosis and increased sputum.
   Received unasyn, vancomycin, levofloxacin in the ED.
   - vancomycin and zosyn
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  He may have congestive hepatopathy, but INR elevation
   indicates some degree of synthetic dysfunction.  Last LFTs NL at [**Hospital 11608**] in [**2165**].  No other known hx liver disease.  He does admit to
   significant tylenol use but uncertain how much.
   - hepatitis panel
   - check albumin
   - add-on acetaminophen lefel
   - continue to trend
   - fractionate bilirubin
   .
   # ? L atrial filling defect:  seen on CT.  Concerning for thrombus in
   the setting of afib.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension, who presents with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. He has multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), cellulitis, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). The patient is currently in the ICU receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Right Heart Failure: The patient appears to have right heart failure, possibly due to primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension. This can lead to fluid accumulation in the body, especially in the lower extremities, and may worsen over time if not managed properly.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AF): The patient is experiencing AF, which can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke. It is important to control the heart rate and maintain rhythm to prevent further complications.

3. Pneumonia: The patient has signs of pneumonia, indicated by consolidation on CT scan, leukocytosis, and increased sputum production. If left untreated, pneumonia can progress and lead to severe respiratory distress.

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the PE seems to be small and unlikely to be contributing significantly, it still poses a risk for further complications. Monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent worsening of symptoms.

5. Cellulitis: The patient has cellulitis, likely initiated by a burn injury and worsening due to subcutaneous edema. If not treated promptly, cellulitis can spread and lead to severe infection.

6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient has elevated LFTs, indicating possible liver dysfunction. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, and appropriate management should be implemented to prevent liver damage.

7. Thrombus in Left Atrial Appendage: The presence of a thrombus in the left atrial appendage is concerning, especially in the setting of AF. This increases the risk of stroke or systemic embolization if not properly managed.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and aggressive treatment for these various medical conditions to prevent complications and improve his clinical outcomes."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension, presenting with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. He has been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AFib), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), cellulitis, and pain control issues. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Right Heart Failure: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF 30%) may lead to worsening right heart failure, which can cause further dyspnea and hypoxia.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has an infiltrate on CT, indicating pneumonia. This can lead to respiratory distress and the need for more aggressive respiratory support.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's PE is considered acute and unlikely to be clinically meaningful, it should still be closely monitored, as it can potentially worsen and cause further respiratory complications.

4. Cellulitis: The patient's worsening cellulitis may progress to a more severe infection if not properly managed, potentially leading to systemic symptoms and sepsis.

5. AFib: The patient's AFib may contribute to cardiogenic shock and unstable blood pressure. Rate control measures should be continued to prevent further complications.

6. Elevated Liver Function Tests (LFTs): The patient's elevated LFTs suggest possible liver dysfunction. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and potential"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving various treatments and monitoring.

Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Heart failure: The patient's vital signs show an elevated central venous pressure (CVP) and bilateral lower extremity edema, which may indicate heart failure.

2. Infection: The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting the presence of an infection. The patient's antibiotics have been changed, indicating a possible change in the type or severity of the infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is noted as atrial fibrillation (AFib). The patient is on amiodarone for rate control, and cardioversion is being considered by cardiology. The patient is also on heparin due to the presence of pulmonary embolism.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating a decline in renal function. Monitoring of urine output and electrolyte imbalances will be necessary.

5. Pulmonary embolism: The patient has a confirmed pulmonary embolism, for which they are on heparin.

6. Potential complications from central venous catheters: The patient has multiple central venous lines in place, which carry"

   note above, including assessment and plan. I would add:
   57 yo male admitted with newly recognized biventricular failur, PE,
   atrial fibrillation and acute respiratory distress/hypoxia. Borderline
   low BP
s barred effective diuresis yesterday and sats were marginal on
   NRB though degree of hypoxia disproportionate to pt
s exam.
   For biventricular failure, BP improved today and will proceed with
   diuresis.
   For atrial fibrillation, adding digoxin for rate control. As
   restoration to sinus rhythm would improve cardiac fxn and allow for
   more effective diuresis, may be moving toward TEE/cardioversion.
   Remains on heparin for PE, unasyn for cellulitis.
   Hypoxia improved from yesterday though resp status still tenuous- some
   contribution from body positioning.
   Pt is critically ill.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 57-year-old male admitted with biventricular failure, pulmonary embolism (PE), atrial fibrillation, and acute respiratory distress/hypoxia.
- The patient's blood pressure is borderline low, but it has improved after effective diuresis yesterday.
- Oxygen saturation levels were marginal on nonrebreather mask (NRB), but the degree of hypoxia is disproportionate to the patient's exam findings.
- The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, with some contribution from body positioning.
- The patient has been critically ill since admission.
- Medications include lasix for fluid management, amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, heparin for PE, and unasyn for cellulitis.
- The patient's cardiac function is expected to improve with restoration to sinus rhythm, which will allow for more effective diuresis.
- The patient's condition will be monitored closely, including urine output, creatinine levels, and other vital signs.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to biventricular failure: The patient's low blood pressure and fluid overload indicate a risk of cardiogenic shock. Monitoring urine output and adjusting diuretic therapy will be important to prevent this complication.
2. Pneumonia/cellulitis progression: The patient is on antibiotics for cellulitis, but there is a risk of worsening infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as needed is crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU for atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, cellulitis, and pain control. He has a history of cardiac disease, including a prior myocardial infarction. The patient is currently receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 106 beats per minute and blood pressure ranging from 129/84 mmHg to 158/141 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's temperature is slightly low, with a maximum of 36.4°C and a current temperature of 35.8°C. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,675 mL and output of 4,565 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient is receiving heparin sodium infusion at a rate of 1,950 units/hour and other ICU medications including furosemide and morphine sulfate. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission. Physical examination findings include atrial fibrillation, but peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic assessments were not performed due to the patient's uncooperative behavior. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count and troponin levels, along with abnormal kidney function tests. The patient's microbiology report indicates contamination with upper respiratory secretions, rendering the culture results invalid. The patient is on full code status and has not been dispositioned"

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year-old man with a history of hypertension who
   presents with progressive dyspnea, evidence of R heart failure, and
   hypoxia.
   .
   # CHF:  EF25%.  Cause EtOH vs tachycardia-induced vs idiopathic leading
   to hypoxia
   - obtain old TTE records from [**Hospital 11607**]
   - control HR as below
   - will need diuresis after BP stabilizes (holding off for tonight given
   tenuous BP and need for diltiazem gtt, as below)
   - broad-spectrum antibioitics with vancomycin and zosyn for possible
   PNA
   - continue heparin gtt for now until it is more clear whether PE may be
   contributing (also has afib and ? LAA clot so needs anticoagulation
   anyway)
   - sputum cultures
   - blood cultures
   - urine cultures
   - lasix if BP allows. Monitor UOP and if less then 100cc and SBP >100
   plan for 10mg IV lasix
   ..
   # Hypotension:  likely most cardiogenic shock.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Cause may be underlying septic process vs
   primary tachycardia related to septic picture.  Not therapeutically
   anticoagulated, although INR elevated not After 10 mg IV diltiazem
   followed by diltiazem gtt (initially at 15 mg/h, now at 5 mg/h), rate
   control is improved. afib - got 10 IV dilt, now on HR 100 on dilt gtt
   at 5 (15 at highest).  Also got 1.5 L IVF.  Pressures 90s-100s
   systolic.
   - amio gtt and will plan to start PO amio
   - appreciate cardiology recs
   - heparin gtt
   # LE cellulitis: likely initiated by burn injury, now worsening
   secondary to subcutaneous edema
   - will change to unasyn
   - blood cultures
   .
   # PNA:  appears to be infiltrate on CT rather than simply atelectasis
   around effusion.  Afebrile but leukocytosis and increased sputum.
   Received unasyn, vancomycin, levofloxacin in the ED.
   - Plan for Unasyn to cover cellulitis and PNA
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  He may have congestive hepatopathy, but INR elevation
   indicates some degree of synthetic dysfunction.  Last LFTs NL at [**Hospital 11608**] in [**2165**].  No other known hx liver disease.  He does admit to
   significant tylenol use but uncertain how much.

","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension presenting with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. He has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), cellulitis, pain control, congestive heart failure (CHF), and elevated liver function tests (LFTs). 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Worsening of CHF: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and evidence of right heart failure indicate a possible exacerbation of congestive heart failure. This condition can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs, causing further respiratory distress.

2. Development of septic shock: The patient has signs of infection, including leukocytosis, increased sputum production, and positive cultures for bacteria. If the infection spreads and leads to septicemia, it can result in septic shock, characterized by low blood pressure, organ dysfunction, and potentially death.

3. Progression of PE: The patient's clinical presentation and risk factors suggest a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism. If the emboli continue to obstruct blood flow to the lungs, it can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potentially fatal outcomes.

4. Spread of cellulitis: The patient has open wounds on his lower leg with surrounding erythema and warmth. If the cellulitis progresses, it can spread deeper into the tissues and potentially lead to compartment"

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year-old man with a history of hypertension who
   presents with progressive dyspnea, evidence of R heart failure, and
   hypoxia.
   .
   # CHF:  EF25%.  Cause EtOH vs tachycardia-induced vs idiopathic
   cardiomyopathy leading to hypoxia, hypoxia now resolving
   - control HR as below
   - Diuresis: Goal 1-2L negative (10 of IV lasix as needed)
   - continue heparin gtt for now until it is more clear whether PE may be
   contributing (also has afib and ? LAA clot so needs anticoagulation
   anyway)
   - sputum cultures
   - blood cultures
   - urine cultures
   ..
   # Hypotension:  likely most cardiogenic shock.  Currently
   hemodynamically stable and improved.
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation:  Cause may be underlying septic process vs
   primary tachycardia related to septic picture.  Not therapeutically
   anticoagulated, although INR elevated not After 10 mg IV diltiazem
   followed by diltiazem gtt (initially at 15 mg/h, now at 5 mg/h), rate
   control is improved. afib - got 10 IV dilt, now on HR 100 on dilt gtt
   at 5 (15 at highest).  Also got 1.5 L IVF.  Pressures 90s-100s
   systolic.
   - Dig load complete, PO dose
   - appreciate cardiology recs
   - heparin gtt
   - TEE cardioversion planned for Monday
   # LE cellulitis: likely initiated by burn injury, now worsening
   secondary to subcutaneous edema
   - will change to unasyn
   - blood cultures
   # PNA:  appears to be infiltrate on CT rather than simply atelectasis
   around effusion.  Afebrile but leukocytosis and increased sputum.
   Received unasyn, vancomycin, levofloxacin in the ED.
   - Plan for Unasyn to cover cellulitis and PNA
   .
   # Elevated LFTs:  He may have congestive hepatopathy, but INR elevation
   indicates some degree of synthetic dysfunction.  Last LFTs NL at [**Hospital 11608**] in [**2165**].  No other known hx liver disease.  He does admit to
   significant tylenol use but uncertain how much.

","The patient is a 57-year-old man with a history of hypertension who presents with progressive dyspnea, evidence of right heart failure, and hypoxia. The patient's medical conditions include atrial fibrillation (AF), pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), cellulitis, chronic pain, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 25%. The cause of CHF is uncertain, with possible etiologies including alcohol abuse, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or idiopathic cardiomyopathy.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 129/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings include decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally, distended and moderately firm abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, 2+ peripheral edema bilaterally, and an open, weeping wound on the left shin with surrounding warmth and erythema extending to most of the lower leg.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.3 K/uL, elevated troponin T level of 0.02 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 2.1 mmol/L, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), and abnormal renal function tests with a creatinine level of 1."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with chronic dyspnea presenting with hypoxemia and anasarca, who was found to have a new cardiomyopathy. The patient has been receiving various medications including diuretics, antibiotics, and pain management with morphine.

The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure of 130/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese appearance, normal head, ears, nose, and throat, distant heart sounds with crackles in the bibasilar region of the chest, soft non-tender abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities with cellulitis on the left lower extremity.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, creatinine, liver enzymes (ALT and AST), lactate, and lactic acid. The patient's electrolytes are within normal ranges, with slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The cardiac troponin T level is elevated.

The patient's medical history includes chronic dyspnea, new cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, cellulitis, and pain management. The plan includes continuing diuretics for better blood pressure control and hypoxemia improvement, rate control for atrial fibrillation with continued digoxin,"

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with chronic dyspnea and anasarca, who has been found to have a new cardiomyopathy. The patient was diuresed with lasix and oxygen was weaned from the non-rebreather mask to 0-2 liters. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 130/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on heparin sodium infusion and other medications including furosemide (Lasix), morphine sulfate, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, and left lower extremity cellulitis. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and troponin-T levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes. The patient's cardiac enzymes and electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient has a history of allergies to ampicillin and cefepime. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Cardiomyopathy: The patient has been diagnosed with a new cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure and complications related to decreased cardiac function such as fluid overload, pulmonary edema, and arrhythmias.

2. Atrial Fibr"
