   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2176-10-5**] 07:59 PM
   [**2176-10-5**]: Started Metoprolol 25 TID. Around 8pm Pt tacchy to 130s,
   dyspeneic. O2 requirement increased from 2 to 4L. EKG obtained showed
   afib. Given 50 of metoprolol. Ordered 15 IV Dilt but held it as HR came
   down to 80s.  CXR shows increased pulmonary edema. Pt urinating well so
   held off on diuretics.
   ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
   depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and
   hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is considerable
   beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due
   to an irregular rhythm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), aortic stenosis (AS), atrial fibrillation (AF), who presented with rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in [**2174**]. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral vascular issues, normal skin, and unassessed neurologic status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin-T, and prolonged prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR). The patient's medical conditions include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation. The plan includes early cardiac catheterization to address underlying CAD and possible catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient is currently receiving aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), heparin, beta-blockers (BB), statin therapy, and amiodarone. Further assessments and tests are planned, including HbA1c and lipid panel, renal ultrasound (US), and medication reconciliation. The patient's cough is being monitored, and there is no evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient's disposition is to the CCU for now. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of CAD, AS, and AF, which increase the risk of cardiac complications such as myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
2. Pulmonary complications: The patient's pulmonary edema could worsen, leading to respiratory distress or failure. There is also a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Renal complications: The patient's elevated creatinine level indicates renal dysfunction. It is essential to monitor renal function closely and adjust medications accordingly to avoid further nephrotoxicity.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy with heparin and clopidogrel, which increases the risk of bleeding, including gastrointestinal bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.
5. Infection: The patient's elevated WBC count may indicate an infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, is crucial."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of ACS, pulmonary edema, and aortic valve stenosis. The patient was started on metoprolol, but developed atrial fibrillation and required increased oxygen support. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is moderately depressed, with akinesis of the basal septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is also evidence of increased left ventricular filling pressure and moderate aortic regurgitation. The patient's aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed, resulting in moderate aortic valve stenosis. The patient is currently on heparin sodium infusion and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they continue to have episodes of dyspnea and require supplemental oxygen. The patient's lab results show elevated levels of cardiac markers, such as Troponin-T and CK-MB, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient's code status is DNR (Do Not Resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient's history of ACS and ongoing symptoms suggest that there may be ongoing ischemia or recurrent myocardial infarction.
2. Pulmonary Edema - The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and increased pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presents with rest angina in the setting of a rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the conditions mentioned include:

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's rest angina suggests unstable angina, which is a type of ACS. This condition can progress to a full-blown heart attack if not managed properly.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has increased pulmonary edema on the chest X-ray. This could be due to left ventricular dysfunction or exacerbated by the patient's aortic stenosis.

3. Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which may be ventricular tachycardia (VT). These arrhythmias can increase the risk of heart complications such as stroke or further cardiac dysfunction.

4. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS, as indicated by previous cardiac catheterization and the presence of a systolic murmur on physical examination. Severe AS can lead to symptoms of heart failure, syncope, and sudden cardiac death if not treated appropriately.

5. Renal Function Impairment: The patient's baseline"

   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2176-10-5**] 07:59 PM
   [**2176-10-5**]: Started Metoprolol 25 TID. Around 8pm Pt tacchy to 130s,
   dyspeneic. O2 requirement increased from 2 to 4L. EKG obtained showed
   afib. Given 50 of metoprolol. Ordered 15 IV Dilt but held it as HR came
   down to 80s.  CXR shows increased pulmonary edema. Pt urinating well so
   held off on diuretics.
   ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
   depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and
   hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is considerable
   beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due
   to an irregular rhythm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension (HTN), aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presented with rest angina and wide complex tachycardia. The EKG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. The patient's symptoms and EKG findings suggest unstable angina. 

The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past. He is currently experiencing pulmonary edema, which is likely secondary to his cardiac condition. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated glucose level, and abnormal kidney function with a creatinine level of 1.3. The cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are within normal limits. 

Plan:
1. Coronary catheterization early next week to address underlying CAD and possibly perform catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT).
2. Medications: ASA 325, Plavix 75, heparin gtt, and holding Coumadin. Increase beta-blockers if heart rate trends up. Start amiodarone gtt if wide complex tachycardia returns.
3. Risk stratify with HbA1c and lipid panel.
4. Continue statin therapy.
5. Monitor for any signs of ventricular t"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presents with rest angina, rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia, and pulmonary edema.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient's symptoms of rest angina and rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia suggest the possibility of ACS, specifically unstable angina or coronary ischemia. This requires immediate attention and further evaluation.

2. Pulmonary edema: The patient has increased pulmonary edema as shown on the chest X-ray. This can be a result of left ventricular dysfunction or valvular heart disease. It is important to monitor the patient's respiratory status and consider interventions such as diuretics to alleviate fluid overload.

3. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has known severe AS, which may contribute to his symptoms of chest pain and syncope. Surgical intervention may be necessary to address the AS, especially if it is severe and symptomatic.

4. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient is currently in AF with PVCs. Rate control is essential to prevent tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and other complications associated with uncontrolled heart rate. Anticoagulation therapy should also be considered"

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 EKG - At [**2176-10-5**] 07:59 PM
   [**2176-10-5**]: Started Metoprolol 25 TID. Around 8pm Pt tacchy to 130s,
   dyspeneic. O2 requirement increased from 2 to 4L. EKG obtained showed
   afib. Given 50 of metoprolol. Ordered 15 IV Dilt but held it as HR came
   down to 80s.  CXR shows increased pulmonary edema. Pt urinating well so
   held off on diuretics.
   ECHO: The left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately
   dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic function is moderately
   depressed (LVEF= 30-40 %) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and
   hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle. There is considerable
   beat-tobeat variability of the left ventricular ejection fraction due
   to an irregular rhythm. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased
   left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular
   chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is
   moderately dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is
   moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. There is moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   1.0-1.2cm2). Moderate (2+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-26**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen.

   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:

   per housestaff

   Above discussed extensively with patient.
   Total time spent on patient care: 60 minutes.
   Additional comments:
   Period of tachycardia in af associated with chest pain - improved with
   addition of more beta blocker
   More evidence to proceed first to cardiac cath
   moderate AS and AR with ef of 30 to 40%
   Will diurese gently today in preparation for the procedure
   Will manage vt with bb until post procedure
   at that point need to decide between eps and possible ablation vs
   empiric drug therapy
   ultimately will likely require ICD as well

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation.
- He presents with rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.
- The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in [**2174**].
- His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7Â°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 116/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's echocardiogram shows left atrial dilation, mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, moderately dilated left ventricular cavity, moderately depressed left ventricular systolic function (LVEF=30-40%) secondary to akinesis of the basal septum and hypokinesis of the rest of the left ventricle, increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg), normal right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion, moderately dilated aortic root and ascending aorta, severely thickened/deformed aortic valve leaflets with moderate aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2) and moderate aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with no mitral valve prolapse, and there is mild to moderate mitral regurgitation.
- The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, glucose, magnesium levels, and slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL.
- The patient is currently receiving metoprolol, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications as per the plan.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episodes of chest pain and rapid heart rate.
- The patient's physical examination reveals a soft S1S2 with irregular rhythm, II/VI systolic murmur best at USB, clear lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, no peripheral edema, and full distal pulses bilaterally.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) - The patient's presentation with rest angina and wide complex tachycardia suggests ACS. This requires immediate attention and further evaluation to determine the extent of coronary artery disease and potential need for revascularization procedures such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
2. Pulmonary Edema - The patient's increased pulmonary edema on chest X-ray and symptoms of dyspnea indicate the possibility of pulmonary edema. This can be a complication of left ventricular dysfunction and may require diuretic therapy to manage fluid overload.
3. Atrial Fibrillation - The patient's ongoing episodes of atrial fibrillation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), pulmonary edema, and fatigue. He has been admitted to the ICU and remains asymptomatic. Tolerated lying flat well without diuresis. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/46 mmHg to 149/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 L NC. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. 

On examination, the patient appears thin and has no acute distress. His cardiovascular examination reveals a systolic and diastolic murmur, along with a soft AI murmur. Peripheral pulses are diminished bilaterally in the lower extremities. Crackles are heard at the lung bases. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with soft and non-tender bowel sounds. Musculoskeletal examination shows muscle wasting. Neurologic examination is within normal limits.

Laboratory results indicate elevated troponin T levels, with a peak of 0.92, as well as elevated CK and CKMB levels. Glucose levels are elevated at 126 mg/dL. Coagulation studies show an elevated PT/PTT/inr. Other lab values are within normal limits.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presents with rest angina, pulmonary edema, and wide complex tachycardia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of CAD and is experiencing rest angina, indicating a possible ACS. This requires urgent intervention, such as cardiac catheterization to identify and treat any blockages in the coronary arteries.
2. Pulmonary edema: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and crackles at the lung bases suggest fluid accumulation in the lungs. This could be due to heart failure or the recent onset of pulmonary edema. Monitoring and managing fluid balance, along with diuretic therapy, will be important in this case.
3. Arrhythmias: The patient has episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which may indicate ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT is a serious arrhythmia that can be life-threatening. The patient is also in atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). Rate control measures and antiarrhythmic medications may be necessary.
4. Severe aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has known severe AS, and his recent echocardiogram showed a gradient of "

1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient's rest angina and wide complex tachycardia are concerning for unstable angina, which is a type of ACS. This condition can lead to myocardial infarction if not promptly managed.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of crackles at the lung bases and poor air movement suggest pulmonary edema. If left untreated, this can progress to severe respiratory distress and respiratory failure.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has had episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which may indicate VT. If not managed effectively, VT can lead to hemodynamic instability and cardiac arrest.
4. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has moderate AS, which can result in symptoms such as chest pain, syncope, and heart failure. Severe AS can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death.
5. Renal Failure:"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with rest angina, rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia, and is currently being treated in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he reports ongoing fatigue. Telemetry shows atrial fibrillation with frequent ectopy. The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis and moderate aortic regurgitation with an ejection fraction of 30-40%. His renal function has improved from Cr 1.3 on admission to Cr 1.0. The patient's cough is similar to his allergic symptoms, without fever or evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS): The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and presents with rest angina, which could indicate unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Prompt intervention, such as cardiac catheterization, is necessary to assess and treat the underlying CAD.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of rest angina and rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia could lead to pulmonary edema due to increased cardiac workload and compromised cardiac output.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has experienced episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which may be ventricular tach"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypertension, aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF). He presents with rest angina and rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia. The patient has undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the past. He is currently experiencing fatigue and has ongoing symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness.

Physical Examination:
The patient is alert and oriented. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.1Â°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 115/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 2 L NC. The patient has diminished pulses in both lower extremities. His cardiovascular examination reveals a soft AI murmur and a soft AS murmur. He has small crackles at the bases of his lungs. His abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to person, place, and time.

Laboratory Results:
The patient's laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 10.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/dL, hematocrit of 38.6%, platelet count of 135 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 126 mg/dL, troponin-T of 0.59 mg/dL, CK-MB of 20 U/L, and CK of 185 U/L. Other lab values are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), unstable angina, and coronary ischemia. He also has pulmonary edema. The plan includes cardiac catheterization today to address underlying CAD and possible catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient is currently on aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, metoprolol, and a statin. The rhythm plan includes rate control with beta-blockers and amiodarone if wide complex tachycardia returns. The pump plan involves careful diuresis post-cath AM given congestive heart failure (CHF). The renal plan includes trend creatinine, dose medications accordingly, and avoid nephrotoxins. The cough is being monitored, and a chest X-ray will be repeated if fever develops. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer is ongoing.

Potential Medical Complications:

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, aortic stenosis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient presents with rest angina in the setting of rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.

The patient has undergone a diagnostic catheterization which revealed 3-vessel coronary artery disease with moderate aortic stenosis and elevated filling pressures. The stents from previous interventions were found to be widely patent, so no further intervention was performed during the catheterization. The plan is for medical management, and the patient is being continued on aspirin, Plavix, heparin, and atorvastatin.

The patient's rhythm is currently in atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and there have been episodes of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) concerning for ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient has been started on sotalol 80 mg, which was increased to 120 mg today. Serial ECGs are being followed, and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is likely to be placed prior to discharge. Heparin gtt is continued for anti-coagulation.

The patient has known severe aortic stenosis, as shown by a catheterization in [**2173**] with a valve area of 1.07 and a gradient of 21 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) reveals moderate aortic regurgitation (AR) with an estimated ejection fraction of 30 to 40%. Daily intake and output (I/O) measurements and weights are being monitored, and there is no evidence of volume overload today. The patient's creatinine (Cr) level has improved from 1.3 on admission to 0.9, indicating improving renal function.

An abdominal ultrasound (US) yesterday revealed an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) measuring 4.1 cm in diameter, which is slightly larger than the previous ultrasound from [**2173-10-24**]. No intervention is planned for the AAA at this time, but the patient is encouraged to maintain close blood pressure control and undergo outpatient follow-up.

The patient reports a cough similar to his allergic symptoms, without fever. The chest X-ray does not show any signs of pneumonia, and the mild elevation in white blood cell count could be secondary to stress. The fever curve is being trended, and a low threshold repeat chest X-ray is planned with posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral views.

The patient's access includes peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) for anticoagulation.

The patient's code status is full code, and he is currently admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) with plans to call out to the hospital ward [**Hospital Ward Name 383**] later today."

1. Unstable angina: The patient's chest pain is concerning for unstable angina, which could potentially lead to a myocardial infarction if not managed appropriately.
2. Ventricular tachycardia (VT): The patient has had episodes of wide complex tachycardia, which is concerning for VT. This condition can be life-threatening if not promptly treated.
3. Renal dysfunction: The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, indicating potential renal dysfunction. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications accordingly will be necessary.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's recent increase in creatinine level suggests a possible AKI. It is important to assess urine output and daily labs to monitor renal function and prevent further deterioration.
5. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's moderate aortic regurgitation and reduced ejection fraction indicate a risk of developing CHF. Monitoring for signs of fluid overload and implementing appropriate diuretic therapy will be crucial.
6. Respiratory infection: The patient has a mild elevation in white blood cell count, which could be secondary to stress or"

The patient is currently on several medications including aspirin (ASA) 325 mg, clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg, heparin, atorvastatin 20 mg, metoprolol 50 mg three times a day, and sotalol 80 mg. 

The patient has been experiencing episodes of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) concerning for ventricular tachycardia (VTach), but is currently in atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVC). The location of VTach is suspected to be either right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) or left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). 

The patient's severe aortic stenosis was confirmed through a transesophageal echocardi"

   resolving renal insufficiency
   Wiill continue sotalol and escalate dose to 120 [**Hospital1 **]
   will plan on ICD in next few days
   Do not want to do EPS given unrevascularizable CAD and concern for CPK
   leak during sustained VT

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is an 78-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in [**2174**]. He also has hypertension (HTN), aortic stenosis (AS), and atrial fibrillation (AF).
2. The patient presented with rest angina and a rapid heart rate with wide complex tachycardia.
3. Diagnostic catheterization was performed yesterday, revealing three vessel disease, moderate AS, elevated filling pressures, and widely patent stents from previous interventions.
4. No further intervention was done during the catheterization, and the plan is for medical management.
5. The patient is currently on several medications including aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), heparin, atorvastatin, and metoprolol (which has been discontinued).
6. The patient's recent laboratory results show a slightly decreased hematocrit (Hct) level post-cath but has stabilized at 33.9% today.
7. The patient's rhythm has been concerning for ventricular tachycardia (VTach), but he is currently in atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular contractions (PVC).
8. The patient's cardiac ejection fraction (EF) is estimated to be between 30-40%, and"
