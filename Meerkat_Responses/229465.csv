   ->unclear significance.  Cycled enzymes which were negative.  Responded
   to 3U prbcs for anemia/bleeding.
   - bolus with LR
   - Has 3 large bore peripherals

   # Hypoxia: Transient and likely [**2-6**] NGT placement however cannot r/o
   PE. Now resolving.  Getting bolus for sedation.
   - Trial to extubate this am.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) who underwent an ex-lap (laparotomy) for tumor resection. The patient experienced intra-operative hypotension, which was likely due to hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode when passing the NG tube (nasogastric tube). The hypotension resolved quickly with minimal intervention.

The patient also had transient hypoxia, which may have been caused by the NGT placement, although it cannot be completely ruled out as a pulmonary embolism (PE). The hypoxia is now resolving.

The patient's baseline hemoglobin level was 30, but it decreased to 19, indicating anemia likely from intra-operative bleeding. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) to address the anemia.

The patient is experiencing a non-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis, possibly due to renal losses given the low urine output for 8 hours in the operating room. The respiratory rate has been increased to decrease the acidosis, although the PCO2 remains inappropriately high.

The patient has a history of recurrent GIST and underwent surgery for tumor resection. Follow-up surgery recommendations, primary oncologist updates, restarting Gleevec (a medication for GIST), and preoperative prophylaxis will be continued.

The patient has multiple access lines and is"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST, who underwent an ex-lap for tumor resection. During the operation, she experienced hypotension, which was likely due to hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode when passing the NGT. The patient also had hypoxia at the time but has since resolved. She is currently in the ICU for further monitoring and treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced intraoperative hypotension, which may be due to hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and provide appropriate interventions if hypotension recurs.
2. Hypoxia: The patient had transient hypoxia that resolved after the NGT placement. It is necessary to continue monitoring her oxygen saturation levels while on mechanical ventilation and wean off FiO2 gradually.
3. Anemia: The patient's baseline Hct was 30%, which decreased to 19%. This could be due to intraoperative bleeding. Close monitoring of her hemoglobin levels is essential, and she may require blood transfusion to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
4. Metabolic Acidosis/Respiratory Acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis with an elevated PCO2. This could be related to renal losses during the surgery. It is important to adjust her respiratory rate to improve ventilation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy. She experienced hypotension intraoperatively, which is believed to be hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode. She also had transient hypoxia, which may have been caused by non-giant nipple placement, but it cannot be completely ruled out as a pulmonary embolism. The patient's baseline hemoglobin level was 30 and is now 19, indicating significant blood loss during surgery. She received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) transfusion. The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis and respiratory acidosis, possibly due to renal losses and inadequate ventilation. She has recurrent GIST and underwent tumor resection during the exploratory laparotomy. She is currently on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for gastrointestinal protection and hepatic sinusoidal prophylaxis. The patient's family has been informed, and the primary oncologist has been updated regarding her ICU admission and when to restart gleevac. The patient will be monitored closely in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who underwent an exploratory laparotomy. The patient experienced hypotension intra-operatively, which was likely due to hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode related to the placement of a nasogastric tube. The hypotension resolved quickly with minimal intervention.

The patient also had transient hypoxia, which may have been caused by the NGT placement, but it cannot be completely ruled out as a pulmonary embolism (PE). However, since the oxygen saturation has improved, further workup for PE will be held off for now.

The patient was found to have anemia, likely from intra-operative bleeding, and received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). The patient's baseline hematocrit (Hct) was 30, and it is now 19.

There is a non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to aggressive intravenous fluid (IVF) administration. The patient has appropriate respiratory compensation.

The patient underwent surgery for tumor resection and will need follow-up with surgery and oncology recommendations. She is currently on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has received preoperative prophylaxis with cefazolin and flagyl.

The patient's access was obtained through two peripheral lines. She is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and will have her electrolytes"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) who underwent an ex-lap (exploratory laparotomy) for tumor resection. The patient experienced hypotension intra-operatively and post-operatively, which was likely due to hypovolemic shock and possibly a vasovagal episode when the NGT (nasogastric tube) was passed. The patient also had hypoxia at the time but has since resolved.

The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) for anemia and bleeding. She is currently off pressors and her TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) has been repeated due to the association of Gleevec (a medication used in CML) with cardiomyopathy in some patients.

The patient's baseline Hct (hematocrit) is 30, and it is now at 24 after receiving the PRBCs. The patient's platelet count is also low, likely due to hemodilution. The patient's metabolic acidosis is non-gap and likely secondary to aggressive IV fluids. 

The patient has recurrent GIST and underwent an ex-lap for tumor resection. She is being followed up with surgery recommendations and oncology recommendations on Monday regarding Gleevec. The patient is on PPI (proton pump inhibitor) and her Hep SC (hepatitis B)"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who underwent an ex-lap for tumor resection.
- Post-operatively, she experienced orthostatic hypotension when moved to a chair, requiring intervention with PRBCs and IV fluids.
- She also had ongoing blood from the nasogastric tube (NGT) and melanic stools, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding.
- The patient received antibiotics as prophylaxis but developed hypotension and hypoxia, which were initially thought to be due to a pulmonary embolism (PE).
- However, these symptoms resolved, and the possibility of PE was ruled out.
- The patient's anemia was likely caused by intra-operative bleeding, for which she received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs).
- She has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to aggressive IV fluids.
- The patient is currently on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and is being monitored for recurrent GIST, with follow-up recommendations for surgery and oncology consultations.
- Her access lines were placed on [**Last Name (LF) 1337**] and [**First Name3 (LF) 47**].
- She is NPO (nothing by mouth) at the moment, and her electrolytes need to be repleted as needed.
- Prophylactic measures include PPI and holding heparin sodium due to"

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST who underwent an ex-lap for tumor resection. She presented with hypotension intra-operatively and has been experiencing recurrent bleeding, resulting in anemia and thrombocytopenia. She also has a non-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to aggressive IVF. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to hypovolemic shock caused by intra-operative bleeding or a vasovagal episode. It is important to closely monitor her blood pressure and fluid balance to prevent further episodes of hypotension.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of her platelet levels and providing support with transfusions if necessary are essential.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are also low due to the bleeding during surgery. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) has been administered, but ongoing monitoring of her hemoglobin levels is necessary.

4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis, which may be related to the aggressive IV fluid administration. This condition should be closely monitored, and appropriate interventions should be taken to correct the acid-base imbalance.

5. Recurrent GIST: The patient has a"

   episode when passing the NGT since it resolved extremely quickly with
   minimal intervention. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been PE given operation and
   malignancy are significant risk factors and also had hypoxia at the
   time. If it was PE it has since resolved as O2 sat now better and
   hypotension resolved. Also, very high risk to anti-coagulate so will
   hold off workup for now.  Repeated EKG here with new TWI V1-V3
   ->unclear significance.  Cycled enzymes which were negative.  Responded
   to 3U prbcs for anemia/bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST (gastrointestinal stromal tumor) who underwent an ex-lap (exploratory laparotomy) and is currently in the ICU for management of GI bleeding. The patient experienced hypotension intra-operatively, likely due to vagal response, and required 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She also had a drop in hematocrit (HCT) and melena (black, tarry stools). Heparin was discontinued, and the patient was stable overnight.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Anemia: The patient's baseline HCT was 30%, which decreased to 24% after likely intra-operative bleeding. She received 3 units of pRBCs and later had a drop in HCT with melena. Her goal HCT is 26%.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension from hypovolemic shock +/- vasovagal episode when passing the NG tube. This resolved quickly with minimal intervention. Given the high risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) due to operation and malignancy, further workup for PE will be held off. The patient responded well to 3U pRBCs for anemia/bleeding and is now off pressors.
3. Hypoxia: The patient had transient hypoxia likely related to NGT placement, but cannot be ruled out"

   episode when passing the NGT since it resolved extremely quickly with
   minimal intervention. [**Month (only) 60**] have also been PE given operation and
   malignancy are significant risk factors and also had hypoxia at the
   time. If it was PE it has since resolved as O2 sat now better and
   hypotension resolved. Also, very high risk to anti-coagulate so will
   hold off workup for now.  Repeated EKG here with new TWI V1-V3
   ->unclear significance.  Cycled enzymes which were negative.  Responded

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST, who underwent an exploratory laparotomy and is currently in the ICU for management of GI bleeding. The patient's baseline HCT is 30%, but dropped to 24 after likely intra-operative bleeding, and received 3 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs). She experienced hypotension intra-operatively, which was likely due to hypovolemic shock or a vasovagal episode. The patient also had hypoxia at the time, but it has since resolved. The patient has been on imatinib for years, but her platelet count has only recently dropped. She is now at 70,000 platelets and trending down. There is a concern for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), so heparin has been withheld. The patient has a non-gap metabolic acidosis likely secondary to aggressive IV fluid administration. The patient's condition is stable, and she is extubated. Further workup for PE (pulmonary embolism) and HIT will be delayed due to the high risk of anticoagulation. The patient's recurrent GIST was resected during the exploratory laparotomy."

The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for tumor resection. She experienced hypotension intra-operatively, likely due to vagal response. She was managed in the ICU for post-operative care and management of GI bleeding. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, with a baseline hemoglobin of 30% and platelet count of 170,000. She received 3 units of packed red blood cells but later developed melena and had a drop in HCT. Heparin was withheld due to suspected HIT, and further evaluation for HIT is planned. The patient also had hypotension and hypoxia, which resolved with minimal intervention. A new right lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray raises concern for possible pulmonary embolism, but further workup is pending. The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis likely due to aggressive IV fluid administration. She underwent surgery for recurrent GIST and is being managed post-operatively."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who underwent an ex-lap for tumor resection. During the operation, she experienced hypotension, likely due to a vagal response. Postoperatively, she was managed in the ICU for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and melena. She received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and has shown stable hemodynamics with good urine output. Her Hct has improved from 26 to 28 and platelet count has stabilized at 79,000/mm3. TTE results remain unchanged. The patient's non-gap metabolic acidosis is likely due to aggressive intravenous fluids. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia: The patient has a baseline Hct of 30, which further decreased to 24 after likely intra-operative bleeding. She received 3 units of PRBCs, but her Hct dropped again. She is being monitored with serial Hcts and her goal Hct is 26. 
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has dropped from 170,000/mm3 to 70,000/mm3. The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, and possibilities include HIT, medication-related effects (such as PPI), or consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of bleeding.

","The patient is a 56-year-old female with a history of GIST who underwent an exploratory laparotomy for tumor resection. The patient experienced hypotension intra-operatively, which was likely due to a vasovagal episode. She also had postoperative bleeding resulting in anemia, requiring transfusion of 3 units of packed red blood cells. The patient's hemoglobin level dropped, and she experienced melena. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 107/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. 

The patient's TTE (transthoracic echocardiogram) showed no atrial septal defect, normal left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function with an ejection fraction greater than 55%. The diameters of the aorta at different levels are normal, and the aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. There is mild thickening of the mitral valve leaflets, but there is no mitral valve prolapse, and trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal, and there is no pericardial effusion.
