   - The patient's first gas s/p intubation showed a continued elevation
   of pCO2 so his RR was increased and his volume was increased.
   - An A-line was placed.
   - He dropped his SBPs to the 80s after getting midazolam boluses, but
   increased with 500 cc of NS boluses x 2.  After the second boluses had
   increased again, but then his SBP drifted down to the 80's.  He was on
   coumadin and has an elevated INR so subclavian line was not attempted.
   IJs were very small/hard to locate on US and given his history of
   radiation to the head and neck IJ wasn't attempted.  Attempted a right
   femoral line without success.  He was given another 2 500 cc NS boluses
   as he appeared very dry. Did not require pressors. Has PIVs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and pneumonia. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress and intubated on [**2156-1-11**]. The patient has been receiving invasive ventilation, an arterial line, and other medications. He has shown improvements in his respiratory status but remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be at risk due to prolonged bed rest, immobility, and decreased nutrition.
2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient likely has pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, which is a common complication in patients with COPD and altered mental status.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure has been in the 80s, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, heart failure, or other underlying conditions.
4. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with reduced ejection fraction, which can lead to fluid overload and respiratory distress.
5. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to infection, decreased mobility, and other factors.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, and now has worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia. The patient is intubated for respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and poor nutritional status.
2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has a history of SCC of the tongue and is undergoing chemotherapy, which can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
3. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, indicating a risk of hypotension. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Parapneumonic effusion: The chest X-ray shows an effusion, which could indicate a parapneumonic effusion secondary to pneumonia.
5. Worsening volume overload: The patient has evidence of volume overload, as seen on the chest X-ray. This needs to be addressed to prevent further complications.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient's COPD may worsen due to the recent respiratory distress and infection.
7. CHF exacerbation: The patient's CHF"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, and subsequently developed worsening hypoxia and hypercarbia. The patient required intubation for respiratory distress on [**2156-1-11**].

The patient's current condition is stable, with improvements in respiratory distress and leukocytosis. However, he continues to experience atrial flutter, impaired skin integrity, pneumonia (aspiration vs hospital-acquired pneumonia), hypotension (not in shock), CHF, and COPD.

The plan includes providing respiratory support with pressure support ventilation, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and fluid restriction to manage the pneumonia. Antibiotics have been started to cover both aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Nebulizers and chest physiotherapy will also be continued.

For CHF management, the patient will continue on beta-blockers and statins. Furosemide will be initiated to achieve an adequate output of urine. The dose of digoxin may be increased tomorrow, and an echocardiogram will be repeated today.

Regarding COPD, nebulizers will be continued, but steroids will not be used at this time.

Atrial fibrillation management will involve continuing amiodar"

   Assesment: This is a 65 year-old male with a history of SCC of the
   tounge found to have mets s/p Cetuximab, afib, COPD, CHF EF 35-40%, who
   was admitted to OMED for pneumonia, likely aspiration, intubated for
   respiratory distress on [**2156-1-11**].
   Plan:
   # Respiratory Failure: Stable on PS 20, PEEP 5 overnight.  Likely
   etiology of PNA  includes aspiration PNA vs HAP superinfection- did not
   approve on the floor on levo.  No cultures yet positive.  Leukocytosis
   improving. BAL yesterday with NGTD.
   - [**Female First Name (un) 217**] today after 2u ffp.
   -  cont vanco/cefepime/flagyl to cover for aspiration and HAP
   -cont  standing nebs
   -cont  chest PT
   -cont  fent/versed for sedation
   - AM CXR
   - Wean PS as tolerated today
   # CHF- EF 35-45% in [**2152**];
   - cont b-blocker- metprolol increased to 100 TID, dig, statin.
   - repeat ECHO today
   - hold lisinopril in the setting of borderline hypotension
   - hold nitrates for BP
   # ? COPD: only on albuterol as outpt. Last spirometry in 06 more c/w
   restrictive rather than obstructive disease. Minimal wheezing on exam,
   but likely due to the significant PNA.
   - standing nebs for now
   - no steroids for now; monitor clinical status
   # Atrial Fibrillation- on amio and metoprolol (toprol XL at home).
   also on coumadin at home. therapeutic INR 2.7 here
   - cont amio, dig, and toprol.
   - holding coumadin today for thoracentesis

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, and was intubated for respiratory distress on [2156-1-11].

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 677 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 49%. His respiratory system compliance is 74, and his peak inspiratory pressure is 26 cmH2O. The patient has crackles in the lung bases, indicating possible pneumonia.
2. Atrial flutter: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently in atrial flutter with a heart rate of 150 beats per minute. He is being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to immobility or pressure ulcers.
4. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. His blood pressure is stable, but he has hypotension"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with history of SCCa--tounge who has metastatsis to sternum
   and is now admitted for pneumonia--concerning for aspiration and now to
   ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He has had significant
   hyptension in this setting consistent with sepsis in the setting of
   pulmonary source.  Multiple attempts at CVL placement failed to result
   in successful placement.
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   Respiratory Failure-The source of his failure is incompletely defined.
   He presented with symptoms of fever and infiltrate suggestive of
   pneumonia.  He had persistent respiratory compromise and with fatigue
   and hypercarbia patient with resultant intubation.  He has reasonable
   airway pressures on the ventilator.  This is in the setting of known
   but mild chronic obstructive disease.
   -Will move to PSV at 20/5 to allow more physiologic and comfortable
   support
   -Will have to monitor patient tolerance
   Pneumonia-patient with likely aspiration pneumonia as part of pneumonia
   presentation, in addition
patient may have viral or atypical infection,
   patient has previous radiation and pneumonitis is possible, alveolar
   hemorrhage is similar in appearance but less likely, PCP/Fungal would
   be less likely with normal ANC and WBC count but infiltrate is
   consistent.  In addition
medication effects will have to be evaluated
   as possible contributor with chemotherapy and amiodarone.
   -Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl to continue
   -Will evaluate pleural fluid in the setting of persistent infectious
   symptoms
   -Bronchoscopy to evaluate for alternative pathogens and thoracentesis
   Sepsis
Patient with criteria met and likely pulmonary source
   -IVF bolus
   -Will need reasonable CVL
   -Will need to continue to follow cultures and expand samples
   -ECHO today with new murmur
will need to reverse anticoagulation to
   allow evaluations to safely proceed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and metastasis to the sternum. He was admitted for pneumonia and is now in the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has had significant hypotension in this setting consistent with sepsis originating from a pulmonary source. Multiple attempts at central venous line (CVL) placement failed to result in successful placement.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 93 bpm (normal range 76-140 bpm), blood pressure of 135/72 mmHg (normal range 115/55-135/78 mmHg), respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute (normal range 11-20 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, controlled with medication. 

The patient has received several medications, including midazolam (Versed), fentanyl, diltiazem, metoprolol, lansoprazole (Prevacid), and antibiotics (vancomycin, metronidazole, and cefepime). 

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and clear breath sounds with diminished sounds at the bases. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal S1 and S2 heart sounds and a systolic murmur."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and metastasis to the sternum. He was admitted for pneumonia, concerning for aspiration, and is now in the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. He presented with symptoms of fever and infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, but it has been unrevealing so far.

The patient's respiratory failure seems to be incompletely defined, and he has significant hypertension in this setting consistent with sepsis in the setting of a pulmonary source. Multiple attempts at central venous line (CVL) placement failed to result in successful placement.

The plan includes weaning pressure support, continuing antibiotics (Vanco, Cefepime, Flagyl), and considering [Female First Name (un) 217] to evaluate if the patient does not continue to improve. Follow-up BAL will also be done. The patient meets the criteria for sepsis and likely has a pulmonary source. Cultures and expanded samples will need to be followed.

Additionally, the patient has atrial flutter, which is now rate-controlled. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed today, and anticoagulation is being held due to a supratherapeutic INR.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition, glycemic control, and monitoring of lines. Prophylaxis for deep vein throm"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue and metastasis to the sternum. He was admitted for pneumonia and is now in the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient has experienced significant hypotension, which is consistent with sepsis originating from a pulmonary source. Multiple attempts at central venous line placement have failed.

The patient's respiratory failure is incompletely defined, as he presented with symptoms of fever and infiltrate suggestive of pneumonia. He underwent a bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), but the results are still unrevealing. The plan is to wean pressure support and continue with the current antibiotics (Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl). If the patient does not continue to improve, further evaluation by [Female First Name (un) 217] will be considered, along with follow-up BAL.

The patient also meets the criteria for sepsis, likely with a pulmonary source. It is recommended to continue monitoring cultures and expand samples.

Additionally, the patient has atrial flutter, which is being rate-controlled. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, and anticoagulation is being held due to a supratherapeutic INR.

In terms of ICU care, the patient requires nutrition support and glycemic control. He has multiple lines inserted, including an 18-gauge and a"

   was admitted to OMED for pneumonia, likely aspiration, intubated for
   respiratory distress on [**2156-1-11**].
   Plan:
   # Respiratory Failure: Stable on PS 5, PEEP 5 overnight.  Likely
   etiology of PNA  includes aspiration PNA vs HAP superinfection- did not
   approve on the floor on levo.  No cultures yet positive.  Leukocytosis
   improving. BAL [**1-12**] with NGTD as is thoracentesis from [**1-13**].
   -  cont vanco/Zosyn  to cover for aspiration and HAP
   -cont  standing nebs
   -cont  chest PT
   - Cont humidified shovel mask today for O2- wean as tolerated.
   # CHF- EF 35-45% in [**2152**];  Echo [**1-13**] with no major change- 30-40% LVEF.
   Mild MR.
   - cont b-blocker- metprolol at  100 TID, dig, statin.
   - Consider restarting lisinopril if hypertensive today
   - hold nitrates for BP
    # ? COPD: only on albuterol as outpt. Last spirometry in 06 more c/w
   restrictive rather than obstructive disease. Minimal wheezing on exam,
   but likely due to the significant PNA.
   - standing nebs for now
   - no steroids for now; monitor clinical status
    # Atrial Fibrillation- on amio and metoprolol (toprol XL at home).
   also on coumadin at home. Supra therapeutic INR 3.3 today
   - cont amio, dig, and toprol.
   - holding coumadin until INR comes down
   # Hyperkalemia- Now resolved. Will monitor.
   # Access: 2 PIV .
   # PPx: therapeutic INR; PPI
   # Code: FULL CODE; living will in place- per partner, would not want
   long term artificial support.
   # Dispo: ICU for now

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue, atrial fibrillation (afib), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and pneumonia, likely aspiration. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for respiratory distress and intubated on [**2156-1-11**].

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate in the range of 89-121 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/67 to 146/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is still sedated and unable to complete a review of systems due to sedation.

The patient's chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates, consistent with pneumonia. He has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and received a thoracentesis. His blood cultures have not yet returned positive. The patient's leukocytosis is improving, and he has been placed on noninvasive ventilation with a humidified shelf mask.

The patient's cardiac status shows an ejection fraction of 35-45%, with mild mitral regurgitation. He is currently on metoprolol, digoxin, and a statin. His blood pressure is well-controlled,"

   etiology of PNA  includes aspiration PNA vs HAP superinfection- did not
   approve on the floor on levo.  No cultures yet positive.  Leukocytosis
   improving. BAL yesterday with NGTD.
   - [**Female First Name (un) 217**] today after 2u ffp.
   -  cont vanco/cefepime/flagyl to cover for aspiration and HAP
   -cont  standing nebs
   -cont  chest PT
   -cont  fent/versed for sedation
   - AM CXR
   - Wean PS as tolerated today
   # CHF- EF 35-45% in [**2152**];
   - cont b-blocker- metprolol increased to 100 TID, dig, statin.
   - repeat ECHO today
   - hold lisinopril in the setting of borderline hypotension
   - hold nitrates for BP
    # ? COPD: only on albuterol as outpt. Last spirometry in 06 more c/w
   restrictive rather than obstructive disease. Minimal wheezing on exam,
   but likely due to the significant PNA.
   - standing nebs for now
   - no steroids for now; monitor clinical status
    # Atrial Fibrillation- on amio and metoprolol (toprol XL at home).
   also on coumadin at home. therapeutic INR 2.7 here
   - cont amio, dig, and toprol.
   - holding coumadin today for thoracentesis
   # Hyperkalemia- Now resolved. Will monitor.
   # FEN:  TF ordered
   # Access: 2 PIV . Consider CVL  if needs pressors.
   # PPx: therapeutic INR; PPI
   # Code: FULL CODE; living will in place- per partner, would not want
   long term artificial support.
   # Dispo: ICU for now

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue with metastasis, currently admitted with respiratory failure. He was initially diagnosed with acute respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis but has shown substantial improvement with treatment for aspiration pneumonia. The patient was extubated and is now following simple commands, responding to verbal stimuli, and demonstrating reasonable stability in his respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and appropriate measures such as chest physiotherapy (PT) and suctioning should be performed. Oxygen therapy should be weaned as possible while ensuring adequate ventilation. A repeat arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis should be done to establish baseline values and set goals for ventilation.

2. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient should continue receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). Follow-up BAL final results should be monitored, although no organisms were seen.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity should be monitored for any signs of deterioration or breakdown.

4. Atrial Flutter: The patient's atrial flutter should be managed with lopressor for rate control.

5. Nutrition: The patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) but should be transitioned to oral intake with supplemental nutrition as feasible.

6. Glycemic Control: The patient's blood glucose levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with h/o SCCA tounge with mets now admitted with respiratory
   failure, likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis.  He has shown
   substantial improvement with Rx for aspiration pneumonia and now is s/p
   extubation with reasonable stability or respiratory status following
   ETT removal.
   1) RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])-
   -Close chest PT and suctioning
   -OOB to chair if possible
and will encourage chest PT and suctioning
   -O2 to wean as possible
   -Does have diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but do
   need to confirm extent and severity and would favor repeat ABG today to
   establish baseline and goals for ventilation.
   2)PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION-
   -Continue with Vanco/Zosyn
   -Follow up BAL final results but no organisms seen
 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER)
   -Lopressor for rate control

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue with metastasis, who was admitted with respiratory failure likely secondary to aspiration pneumonitis. The patient has shown substantial improvement with treatment for aspiration pneumonia and is now post-extubation with reasonable stability in respiratory status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11]) - The patient may experience respiratory distress or further deterioration in respiratory function, which can lead to hypoxia and/or hypercapnia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.

2. PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION - The patient may develop or worsen aspiration pneumonia due to the previous episode of unplanned extubation. Continuing with the current antibiotic regimen of Vancomycin and Zosyn is appropriate, and follow-up BAL final results should be monitored.

3. IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY - The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Regular repositioning and skin assessment are important to prevent this complication.

4. ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) - The patient has atrial flutter, which needs to be managed with rate control medication such as Lopressor. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential to prevent complications like"

   -cont  standing nebs
   -cont  chest PT
   - Cont humidified shovel mask today for O2- wean as tolerated.
   # CHF- EF 35-45% in [**2152**];  Echo [**1-13**] with no major change- 30-40% LVEF.
   Mild MR.
   - cont b-blocker- metprolol at  100 TID, dig, statin.
   - Consider restarting lisinopril if hypertensive today
   - hold nitrates for BP
    # ? COPD: only on albuterol as outpt. Last spirometry in 06 more c/w
   restrictive rather than obstructive disease. Minimal wheezing on exam,
   but likely due to the significant PNA.
   - standing nebs for now
   - no steroids for now; monitor clinical status
    # Atrial Fibrillation- on amio and metoprolol (toprol XL at home).
   also on coumadin at home. Supra therapeutic INR 3.3 today
   - cont amio, dig, and toprol.
   - holding coumadin until INR comes down
   # Hyperkalemia- Now resolved. Will monitor.
   # Access: 2 PIV .
   # PPx: therapeutic INR; PPI
   # Code: FULL CODE; living will in place- per partner, would not want
   long term artificial support.

   This is a 65 year-old male with a history of SCC of the tounge found to
   have mets s/p Cetuximab, afib, COPD, CHF EF 35-40%, who was admitted to
   OMED for pneumonia, likely aspiration, intubated for respiratory
   distress on [**2156-1-11**].
   # Respiratory Failure:  Intubated on [**2156-1-11**] because of hypercapneic
   respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia versus alternate
   interstitial process.  Had left pleural effusion and multifocal
   bilateral airspace opacities on chest CT on [**2156-1-10**].  Weaned off
   ventilator and self-extubated  on [**1-14**] but worsened over course of day
   and had acute hypercapneic respiratory failure and mental status
   changes overnight into [**1-15**], possibly secondary to aspiration
   pneumonitis/pneumonia (coughed with fluid intake) vs atelectasis.
   Having copious sputums again.  No cultures yet positive.  Leukocytosis
   improving. BAL [**1-12**] with NGTD as is thoracentesis from [**1-13**].

","Summary:
- 65-year-old male with a history of SCC of the tongue, mets, afib, COPD, CHF EF 35-40%
- Admitted for pneumonia, likely aspiration, intubated for respiratory distress on [**2156-1-11**]
- Self-extubated on [**2156-1-14**]
- Current concerns: respiratory failure, CHF, COPD, atrial fibrillation, hyperkalemia

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of pneumonia and aspiration, which can lead to respiratory failure. Being self-extubated, there is a risk of further respiratory distress.
2. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with reduced ejection fraction (35-40%). This condition can worsen due to fluid overload or infections.
3. COPD: The patient's COPD may exacerbate due to respiratory infections or inadequate respiratory support.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of afib and is on anticoagulation therapy. There is a risk of thromboembolic events or bleeding complications.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient had resolved hyperkalemia but needs to be monitored for any recurrence.
6. Infection: Pneumonia and possible HAP should be considered, especially given the recent aspiration event.
7. Fluid and electrolyte imbalance: The patient's fluid balance and electrolytes"

   65 yo male with history of SCCA-tounge with mets and now with failure
   to tolerate exbutation.  This is in the setting of reasonably high
   volume of pulmonary secretions despite patient OOB and with aggressive
   suctioning and pulmonary toilet across the day.  He evolved tachpnea,
   tachycardia and was intubated with hypercarbic respiratory failure in
   that setting once mental status had deteriorated significantly.  His
   recurrent respiratory failure is likley attributable to his multifocal
   infiltrates which may well be related to aspiration pneumonitis and
   pneumonia which in the setting of tachypnea and likley dynamic
   hyperinflation in the setting of known COPD resulted in hypecarbic
   respiratory failure.

   mechanical ventilation this morning of PIP=24 and plateau at 18 with
   expiratory flow return to zero he has minimal evidence of persistent
   and significant airflow obstruction.  In the setting of tachypnea
   experienced with aspiraiton events and hypoxemic driven respiratory
   distres this may have led to CO2 elevation acutely and with

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue with metastasis, who has experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU due to his inability to tolerate extubation. The patient's condition is characterized by high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, altered mental status, and difficulty clearing pulmonary secretions. Imaging reveals increased lung volumes, right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities, suggesting a possible left-sided effusion or consolidation. The patient's recurrent respiratory failure is likely attributed to multifocal infiltrates, which may be related to aspiration pneumonitis and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and requires continued medical management, including antibiotics, pulmonary toilet, and consideration of tracheostomy for continued support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of SCCA with metastasis, recurrent respiratory failure, and difficulty in tolerating extubation puts him at risk for further respiratory complications, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and barotrauma.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacities on imaging suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia is a likely diagnosis due to the patient's altered mental status and difficulty in clearing pulmonary secretions.
3. Aspiration Events: The patient's impaired ability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration events, leading to further respiratory"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of SCC of the tongue, metastasis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and CHF. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, likely aspiration, and intubated for respiratory distress on [2156-1-11]. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and atrial flutter.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pneumonia versus alternate interstitial process. He had a previous episode of hypercapnic respiratory failure and mental status changes, possibly due to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia or atelectasis.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be a result of prolonged immobility or pressure ulcers.
3. Atrial Flutter: The patient has atrial flutter, which is an abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to complications such as stroke or heart failure.
4. Hyperkalemia: The patient experienced hyperkalemia, which has since resolved. Monitoring potassium levels is important to prevent future complications.
5. COPD Exacerbation: The patient has a history of COPD, and it is likely that his current condition has exacerbated this condition. Close monitoring and management of COPD symptoms are necessary.
6. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. It is important to monitor his cardiac"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, metastatic disease, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, likely due to aspiration, and subsequently intubated for respiratory distress on January 11th. The patient experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure, including hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. He was extubated on January 14th but re-intubated the following day due to worsening respiratory distress and mental status changes. The patient has a history of SCC of the tongue with metastasis, AF, COPD, and CHF. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 138 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 147/80 mmHg to 176/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to follow commands.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure, which could be due to pneumonia or aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia,"

","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, metastasis, atrial fibrillation, COPD, and congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. He was admitted to the hospital for pneumonia, likely aspiration, and subsequently intubated for respiratory distress on [**2156-1-11**].

Summary of Progress:
- The patient was initially intubated due to hypercapnic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pneumonia or an alternate interstitial process.
- He was weaned off the ventilator and self-extubated on [**1-14**] but experienced worsening symptoms and mental status changes overnight into [**1-15**], possibly secondary to aspiration pneumonitis/pneumonia or atelectasis.
- The patient has copious sputum production and leukocytosis improving.
- A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed on [**1-12**], and a thoracentesis was done on [**1-13**].
- Current medications include vancomycin (Vanco) and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) to cover for aspiration and hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as nebulizers (nebs) for respiratory support.
- The patient's altered mental status is likely secondary to hypercapnic respiratory failure but could also be due to a cerebrovascular accident ("

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo male with SCCA tounge and now with recurrent respiratory failue
   secondary to altered mental status, continued high volume of secretions
   and severe hypercarbia.  This may be related to tachypnea in the
   setting of hypoxemia and aspiration contributing to dynamic
   hyperinflation and re-intubated with hypercarbia and altered mental
   status primarily.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
This is now more clearly
   and quite likely related to both aspiration, multifocal opacities and
   now with significant neuromuscular weakness an associated condition
   which is driving the recurrent hypercarbia and today on rounds he has a
   NIF of -11
Severely impaired.
   -Will continue with Vanco/Zosyn Rx
   -Infiltrates improved modestly
   -NIF of -11 concerning for weakness driving what may well be likely
   continued and persistent requirement for ventilatory support.
   -If we move to extubation it would be a path of expected intermittent
   support from non-invasive ventilation and likely need for MIE for
   support of clearance of secreations.
   -Tracheostomy would be possible but this has been described as
   un-attractive as an option for the patient

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has pneumonia and requires mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status, high volume of secretions, and severe hypercarbia. The respiratory failure is likely related to aspiration, neuromuscular weakness, and multifocal opacities seen on imaging.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is already on antibiotics for pneumonia, but there is still a risk of developing VAP due to the prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and high volume of secretions increase the risk of aspiration, which can lead to further lung infections.
3. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is critically ill and may be at risk for developing pressure ulcers or bedsores due to prolonged immobility.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated INR and PT/PTT levels indicate a potential bleeding risk, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has atrial flutter, and there is a need for cardiac monitoring and management with medications such as amiodarone, digoxin, and lopressor.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, infection parameters, and laboratory values to promptly identify and manage any potential complications."
