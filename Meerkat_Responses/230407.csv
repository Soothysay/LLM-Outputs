","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse and withdrawal seizures. He presents with alcohol intoxication and possible seizures in the emergency department. The patient's current condition includes alcoholic hallucinosis but no current evidence of seizures. His vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. The patient has diminished breath sounds in the respiratory/chest examination. Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient is being treated for ETOH withdrawal with diazepam and ativan. Potential medical complications include seizures, metabolic acidosis, hypertension, right hip pain with possible infected joint, and extra-axial hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures in the setting of alcohol withdrawal. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of seizures and treat accordingly.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap with elevated lactate, likely due to alcohol and starvation ketosis. This condition needs to be managed with IV fluids and thiamine administration before glucose to prevent worsening of the acidosis.
3. Hypertension: The patient is on atenolol for hypertension but the dosage is unknown. It is important to monitor blood pressure closely and consider restarting antihypertensive medication once the patient is stable.
4. Right Hip Pain: The patient has right hip pain with erythema, warmth, left"

- The patient is planned to be transferred to the floor once stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Reoccurrence of seizures: The patient has a history of seizures and is currently being treated for alcohol withdrawal, which can also increase the risk of seizures. Close monitoring and consideration for restarting dilantin may be necessary.

   -continue thiamine, folic acid, MVI
   -SW consulting
   # H/O Seizures
 Per records, has a history of childhood seizures for
   which he takes dilantin.  Dilantin level <0.6, so unclear if he is
   actually taking this.
   -Consider restarting dilantin today
   # HTN
 On atenolol at home, but unknown dose.   Holding
   antihypertensives in the setting of benzodiazapines.
   -Consider restarting once stable off diazapam.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old man with a chief complaint of alcohol withdrawal. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently showing signs of improvement, including being conversant and not tremulous. The patient is experiencing severe diarrhea and has a history of seizures since childhood. He has been receiving Valium for alcohol withdrawal and will continue with CIWA monitoring. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/94 to 123/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Alcohol withdrawal: The patient is showing signs of improvement, but there is still a risk for further complications related to alcohol withdrawal. Close monitoring with CIWA assessment is important to detect any breakthrough symptoms and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Diarrhea: The patient's severe diarrhea needs to be evaluated further to determine the cause. It could be related to alcohol intoxication or Clostridium difficile infection. Anti-diarrheal medication can be given while awaiting the results of the workup.
3. Seizures: The patient has a history of seizures since childhood, and it is crucial to restart home dilantin to prevent further seizure episodes.
4. Thiamine deficiency: Alcoholics are at high risk for thiamine deficiency, which can lead to"
