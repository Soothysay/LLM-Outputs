   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   94% on 15L NRB, but not tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. CXR/lung
   exam consistent with pulmonary edema. Cr has been rising with mild
   diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent ECHO. Pt. has been
   very fluid positive for length of stay. Would also consider PE given
   rapid onset of hypoxia if does not improve w/ diuresis but has not been
   hypotense or more tachycardic.
   - Lasix drip titrate to >100cc/hr

   - Will continue to diurese given pulmonary edema and large O2
   requirement.
   - Renal U/S to r/o obstruction
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - will d/w primary onc team whether to put in doboff after her
   oxygenation is more stable as not a candidate for G-tube currently.
   - Question PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeding or TPN recs pending route of
   nutrition
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio. HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, likely related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   Controlled at this time, though was a bit borderline with systolics in
   the 100s and would benefit from drifting up a bit while diuresing.
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   - Diltiazem for rate control as blood pressure allows

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. She is currently on a furosemide (Lasix) drip for diuresis due to diastolic dysfunction seen on recent echocardiogram. The patient has been very fluid positive for the length of her stay. She is also experiencing hypoxia, which is being managed with oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask. Her respiratory support includes O2 delivery and ABG results show a pH of 7.23.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing severe hypoxia, as indicated by her oxygen saturation level of 94% on 15L NRB. This could potentially lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has signs of pulmonary edema, which is evident from crackles heard in her lungs bilaterally. If not treated effectively, it can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

3. Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's rising creatinine levels indicate worsening renal function, possibly due to diastolic dysfunction. If not managed appropriately, this can lead to further renal decline and potential acute kidney injury.

4. Anemia of Chronic Disease: The patient appears to have anemia of chronic disease, characterized by increased ferritin and preserved iron to TIBC ratio. If left untreated, it can result in worsening fatigue and decreased oxygen-c"

   -Renal U/S was performed and preliminary read indicates no
   hydronephrosis. Doppler evaluation extremely limited given patient
   inability to breath hold. Resistive indices around 0.8 in both kidneys,
   which is slightly elevated, but given limited exam, may be unreliable.
   -The patient was not able to receive Zaroxylin as as she was noted to
   be coughing on a swab, very high risk of aspiration.  She continued on
   Lasix infusion at the rate of 20, but became hypotensive and rate had
   to be lowered to 10.

   edema.
   #.  Hypoxia:
   The patient is currently 100% on medium concentration mask, but not
   tachypnic, speaking in full sentences. Differential is broad and
   includes pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction and low
   oncoltic pressures secondary to malnutrition.  Alternatively,
   infectious causes such as influenza or PNA could be considered.
   Finally, pulmonary embolism could present with hypoxia, although
   radiographic presence of bilateral infiltrates on CXR, with chest pain,
   hypotension or tachycardia make it less likely.   CXR/lung exam is
   consistent with pulmonary edema, however IJ is not distended.   Cr has
   been rising with mild diuresis c/w diastolic dysfunction seen on recent
   ECHO. Pt. has been very fluid positive for length of stay. Given a
   combination of nausea in a patient with known distolic dysfunction,
   will rule out for MI.

   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:

   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema. She is currently in the ICU and requires respiratory support with a medium concentration mask, but is speaking in full sentences. Her vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 100/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has a history of anaphylaxis to iodine, erythromycin base, unknown reactions to codeine, NSAIDs, aspirin, fosamax, zinc, tramadol HCl, and heparin sodium. She is receiving infusions of furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 10 mg/hour and famotidine (Pepcid). Other medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient has diffuse 4+ pitting edema from left to right and peripheral pulses palpable. Her lab results show a WBC count of 11.8 K/uL, Hct of 28.4%, Plt of 97 K/uL, Cr of 1.7 mg/dL, Glucose of 143 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's assessment includes hypoxia, renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, malnutrition, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and potential complications such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and cutaneous candidiasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has a broad differential diagnosis including pulmonary edema secondary to diastolic dysfunction, low oncotic pressures due to malnutrition, infectious causes like influenza or pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. The patient's oxygenation may deteriorate if the underlying cause of hypoxia is not addressed promptly.
2. Renal Insufficiency: The patient has a rising creatinine level and evidence of prerenal azotemia. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix should be continued, and the response should be closely monitored. If there is no improvement, alternative interventions may be necessary.
3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's symptoms of crackles to the apices bilaterally and radiographic presence of bilateral infiltrates on CXR suggest pulmonary edema. Aggressive diuresis with Lasix should be continued, and additional measures such as empiric coverage for HCAP and PCP should be considered if there is no improvement.
4. Malnutrition: The patient has severe malnutrition, which may contribute to her hypoxia and overall poor condition. Nutritional support in the form of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be required if the patient cannot swallow.
5. Anemia: The patient appears to have anemia of chronic disease"

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   82 year-old woman with incipient respiratory failure.  Differential is
   broad, and includes
   CHF
          Perhaps most likely, though neck vein and ultrasound exam
   argue somewhat against this as does lack of response to Lasix so far.

   Infection
          Influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and PCP all need to be
   considered.
          Will test for influenza, and maintain droplet precautions.
          Will attempt to get sputum, but may be unable to tolerate
   induction.
          Will trial very aggressive CHF therapy for next 4 hours.  If
   not markedly better, will empirically treat for influenza, HCAP, and
   PCP
          If intubated

   No evidence for PE; radiographic opacities argue against as does

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 82-year-old woman with incipient respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis includes congestive heart failure (CHF), infection (such as influenza, bacterial pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia), acute renal failure, malnutrition, hypernatremia, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is on full code status. The plan is to aggressively treat for CHF, maintain droplet precautions due to possible influenza, attempt to obtain sputum, and empirically treat for influenza, healthcare-associated pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia if there is no significant improvement in the next 4 hours. The patient's respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a medium concentration mask, and her ABG results show ///23. The physical examination reveals crackles in the chest, right lower extremity edema, left lower extremity edema, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and normal neurologic examination. The lab results show a WBC count of 11.8 K/uL, Hct of 28.4%, Plt of 97 K/uL, Cr of 1.7 mg/dL, Glucose of 143 mg/dL, and other electrolyte imbalances. Imaging shows bilateral symmetric infiltrates on chest X-ray."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.  Differential diagnosis
   at this point includes infectious pneumonia, bacterial or viral, PCP,
   [**Name10 (NameIs) 10190**] heart failure, third spacing due to malnutrition into lungs,
   diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.  Also consider Wegener
s or Goodpasture
   in setting of concurrent renal failure.
   - Continue current vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Bronch with BAL today
   - Check BNP
   - Check ANCA, [**Doctor First Name **], anti-GBM
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Doctor First Name **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. Hypotension/Shock: Likely related to recent intubation and
   initiation of sedation.  Also likely intravascularly depleted as
   responsive to fluid boluses.  Less likely to be cardiogenic but will
   get [**Doctor First Name **] as above.
   - place arterial line today
   - IVF prn to maintain blood pressure
   - Will give 1 unit blood for colloid and hopefully will stay
   intravascular
   - Assess for adrenal insufficiency with random cortisol
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction.  Urine lytes c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs.
   hypovolemia but may also have ATN given non-response to diuresis  Renal
   U/S shows no e/o obstruction.
   - Renal following, will verify urine sediment findings
   - Check urine lytes
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - Place OG tube today, may need endoscopic assistance
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema

   - Had increasing respiratory distress after lasix gtt stopped and
   getting fluids, got ABG (7.33/36/184/20/-6) and CXR looked relatively
   stable with an increase in interstitial.  She clinically improved
   without intervention.
   - Placed on face mask at 15L due to pO2 of 184, tolerated well for a
   few hours, then placed back on NRB.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 yo F w/ severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary
   edema, now intubated and sedated.
   #.  Respiratory Failure/Hypoxia:
   Had episode of desat on NRB, not responsive to Lasix and was
   intubated.  Continues to have a broad differential diagnosis.  Has
   negative swab for influenza, and chest xray and physical exam most
   consistent with pulmonary edema, possible secondary to diastolic
   dysfunction.  She has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition.
   Also started empiric pneumonia and PCP [**Name9 (PRE) 10187**] yesterday in setting of
   lack of clinical improvement.  Likely has worsening volume overload and
   acute renal failure making diuresis difficult.
   - Continue vent settings
   - Continue empiric coverage for HCAP, PCP with [**Name9 (PRE) 2601**]/Cefepime/Cipro and
   IV Bactrim
   - Have dc
ed droplet precautions
   - Urine legionella Ag negative
   - FU respiratory culture
   - [**Name9 (PRE) **] today
   - Cardiac enzymes higher than previous but stable and likely elevated
   troponins due to renal failure
   - strict I/O
   - daily weights
   #. [**Last Name (un) **]:
   Baseline Cr 1-1.3, Most likely [**1-4**] diuresis in the setting of diastolic
   dysfunction. Urine sediment bland, no muddy brown casts.   Urine lytes
   c/w prerenal cause, poor forward flow vs. hypovolemia.  Renal U/S shows
   no e/o obstruction.
   - Will continue to diurese at this point and monitor for response.  If
   no clinical improvement, may need to re-address.
   -Trend Cr, UOP
   - renally dose all meds
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   #.  Malnutrition:
   Has been unable to swallow [**1-4**] dysmotility, possibly secondary to
   previous radiation. Contributing to her hypoxia.
   - NPO for now in the setting of respiratory distress.
   - [**Month (only) 8**] need PICC and initiation of TPN if patient not going to be a
   candidate for dobhoff due to her poor respiratory status
   #. Anemia:
   Appears to be anemia of chronic disease from iron studies on [**2168-10-19**]
   with increased ferritin, essentially preserved iron to TIBC ratio.
   Given macrocytic, may be a contribution from hypothyrodism.   HCT
   stable since [**2168-10-16**].
   - Trend HCT
   #. Thrombocytopenia:
   HIT antibody negative, possibly related to poor nutritional status.
   - Trend thromboyctopenia
   #. BCL:
   Has been in remission but LDH rising.
   - f/u onc recs
   #.  Hypothyroid:
   - Continue levothyroxine IV
   #Cutaneous cadidiasis:
   Intertriginal erythema
   - Continue miconazole powder
   #  Hypertension:
   - Hold diltiazem while actively diuresing
   #.  Atrial fibrillation
   -Hold all rate control meds for now while diuresing

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with severe malnutrition, renal insufficiency, and pulmonary edema who is currently intubated and sedated. The patient had an episode of desaturation on non-rebreather (NRB) mask that was not responsive to Lasix and required intubation. The differential diagnosis includes respiratory failure/hypoxia, pneumonia, and possible secondary pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction.

The patient has negative swabs for influenza and a chest X-ray and physical exam most consistent with pulmonary edema. She also has low oncotic pressures secondary to malnutrition. Empiric coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) has been started.

The patient's urine Legionella antigen is negative, and further follow-up with respiratory culture is planned. The patient's cardiac enzymes are elevated but stable, likely due to renal failure. Strict input/output (I/O) monitoring, daily weights, and renally dosing of medications are recommended.

The patient's malnutrition is contributing to her hypoxia, and she is unable to swallow due to dysmotility, possibly secondary to previous radiation. Nutritional support in the form of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) should be considered if the patient cannot tolerate enteral feeding.

The patient appears to have anemia of chronic disease with increased ferritin and essentially preserved iron"
