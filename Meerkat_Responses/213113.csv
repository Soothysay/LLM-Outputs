   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o F with hypertension who presented to OSH with acute ST Segment
   Elevation MI in cardiogenic shock, requiring IABP pump placement and IV
   Dopamine, who is s/p VT/VF arrest x 2.
   .
   .
   # Cardiac Arrest:
   On Arctic Sun protocol since midnight last night, reached goal temp
   2:30am.  Cooling for 12 hours because patient was hypothermic naturally
   for about 6hrs on her own prior to protocol.  Amiodarone infusion has
   been stopped.
   -          Rewarm starting at 2:30pm
   -          Paralytics and sedatives can start to come off w temp 35F,
   per protocol
   -          Will consider switching to propofol to help with constant
   waking up of patient for neuro exams, pending hemodynamic status per
   Swan-Ganz catheter
   -          Will monitor Neuro exam, f/u Neuro Recs
   -          EEG today and monitor for seizure activity
   -          Will exchange RIJ for Cordis to place Swan-Ganz catheter to
   get better sense of hemodynamic status and pressures
   # s/p STEMI:
   Has Intra-aortic balloon pump, on Heparin gtt
   -          will stop Heparin gtt temporarily for procedures
   -          continue aspirin, statin
   -          holding plavix for possible CABG
   # Cardiogenic Shock:
   Presumably has cardiogenic shock s/p STEMI in setting of hypotension.
   n        Measure wedge pressure and hemodynamic status with Swan Ganz
   catheter
   n        -check mixed venous O2sat
   # Lactic Acidosis
   Improved with bicarb and increased ventilation.  Stopped Bicarb drip
   b/c acidosis was overcorrected.  Now just has respiratory alkalosis,
   which will need to be monitored and corrected with ABGs and decreasing
   ventilation.  Had received 80% of 3amps of bicarb overnight.
   - monitor respiratory alkalosis and decrease ventilation by monitoring
   ABGs.
   .  .
   #  HYPERGLYCEMIA:  No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol
   - Continue insulin gtt.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in cardiogenic shock. The patient required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and intravenous dopamine. She experienced two ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrests and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols. 

The patient's condition has been complex and required various interventions. The note mentions rewarming the patient after being hypothermic, considering the use of propofol for constant neurological examination, monitoring for seizure activity, and exchanging the right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter for a Cordis catheter to place a Swan-Ganz catheter for better hemodynamic monitoring.

In addition to the STEMI, the patient is also experiencing cardiogenic shock, presumed to be secondary to the myocardial infarction. The note mentions the need to measure wedge pressure and assess hemodynamic status with the Swan-Ganz catheter.

The patient also had lactic acidosis, which improved with bicarbonate administration but was overcorrected. Now, the focus is on monitoring and correcting respiratory alkalosis with ABGs and decreasing ventilation.

Furthermore, the patient presented hyperglycemic and will be on hydrocortisone with a study protocol starting in ["

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in cardiogenic shock. The patient required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and intravenous dopamine. The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) followed by ventricular fibrillation (VF), both of which were successfully defibrillated. After the second VF event, the patient returned spontaneously to normal sinus rhythm.

The patient was then taken to the catheterization lab for tandem heart placement. Post-procedure, the patient continued to be severely hypoxic due to catheter migration from the tandem heart device. ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was added to the tandem heart to improve oxygenation.

The patient's neurological status is poor, with unresponsiveness and minimally responsive pupils. An EEG (electroencephalogram) has been ordered to assess the brain activity. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation.

The patient's lab results show elevated troponin T levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. Other lab abnormalities include hyperglycemia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient's current medical plan includes continuing to unload the left ventricle with the tandem heart device and ECMO, titrating flow to maintain a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She required immediate interventions including intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and intravenous dopamine. The patient experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) arrest, followed by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and ventricular fibrillation (VFib). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and the patient returned spontaneously to circulation.

Since admission, the patient has been on the tandem heart device with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support her circulation and oxygenation. The tandem heart device is being used to unload the left ventricle (LV) and improve cardiac output. ECMO is providing respiratory support by oxygenating the blood externally.

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. Cardiogenic shock persists, requiring ongoing management of the tandem heart device and ECMO. The patient also experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure due to catheter migration from the tandem heart device, which has been treated effectively with ECMO. Additionally, the patient likely had an aspiration event during the PEA arrest and CPR, leading to worsening pulmonary edema as seen on chest X-ray. Prophylactic antibiotics have been started to cover potential ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   76 y/o F with hypertension who presented to OSH with acute ST Segment
   Elevation MI in cardiogenic shock, requiring IABP pump placement and IV
   Dopamine, who is s/p VT/VF arrest x 2.  Now s/p PEA arrest and vfib,
   spontaneous return of circulation.
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH for CABG eval after cardiac cath
   showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient then syncopized
   at home, unresponsive for 20-30 seconds, vomited, severe chest pain.
   POBA LAD and LCx, intubated for respiratory distress, dopamine for
   hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was initiated. Yesterday
   became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Had CPR for 2
   mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100 of lidocaine. Received
   a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated.
   #Cardiogenic shock: Patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.
   -          continue to unload LV with tandem heart device with ECMO.
   -          Titrate flow to MAP ~70
   -          Wean pressors as tolerated
   -          Continue heparin gtt for tandem heart maintenance with goal
   ACT~200
   -          Keep CVP>15-20 to maintain optimum flow from tandem heart.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: New respiratory failure likely
   secondary to catheter migration from tandem heart device. Other
   respiratory failure may be secondary to acute congestive heart failure.
   -          treated effectively currently with ECMO
   -          CXR with worsened edema - ?secondary to decreased peep vs
   other etiology
   -          Patient likely also had an aspiration event during PEA
   arrest and CPR
   -          Cover potential ventilator associated pneumonia with
   cefepime and vancomycin (day [**1-8**]), plan for 8 day course for VAP
   -          Diurese today -  40mg IV lasix
   # Anemia: unclear etiology at this time. Required 3u PRBCs. [**Month (only) 8**] be
   secondary to hemolysis from catheters. Worrisome for RP bleed. Will
   continue to monitor and transfuse as necessary. ENT to evaluate mouth
   bleed.
   #. Thrombocytopenia: unclear etiology. Required 1u plt. Will continue
   to monitor. [**Month (only) 8**] be secondary to consumption from catheters. Seems too
   early to be related to HIT. Will continue to trend.
   # Neurologic status: definitive therapy is dependent on patient
   neurological status. Neurology has been unable to fully weigh in due to
   concerns of patient still being sedate. Will readdress issue today.
   -          will wean sedation to allow for more definitive neurologic
   exam
   -          await EEG results
   -          appreciate neurology recommendations
   # Cardiac Arrest: ?ventricular fibrillation (prior to OSH) likely
   secondary to severe acidosis.
   -          no need for further anti-arrhythmics as patient
s acidosis
   is now corrected with tandemheart and ECMO
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis
   -          await further clarification of patient
s neurologic status
   before progressing to CABG for definitive therapy.
   # Lactic acidosis
 resolved on ECMO
   # Hyperglycemia - No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol
   -          Continue insulin gtt.
   # Goals of care
 will continue to actively involve the family to
   address goals of care. Once neuro status determined will have goals of
   care meeting.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with an acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock. She required intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) placement and intravenous dopamine. The patient then experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), both of which were successfully defibrillated. She was subsequently intubated for respiratory distress and had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) performed on the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management.

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was found to have severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with anterior, septal, and apical akinesis. There was also mild hypokinesis of the remaining segments, resulting in a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. The patient was started on a tandem heart device with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to support her cardiac function and provide respiratory support. 

The patient's condition has been complicated by several issues. She developed bradycardia and required atropine administration. She also experienced another episode of VF arrest, which was treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), epinephrine, and lidocaine. The tandem heart device was initially placed, but it was partially retracted into the right atrium (RA), causing a shunt. ECMO was subsequently initiated.

The patient's laboratory values indicate anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 23.5% and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 46,000/mm3. The cause of these abnormalities is unclear at this time. The patient's respiratory status has improved with the use of ECMO, but she continues to have hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to the acute congestive heart failure. She is being covered for potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with cefepime and vancomycin.

The patient's neurological status is of concern, as she remains sedated and unable to undergo a definitive neurological examination. An electroencephalogram (EEG) has been ordered to evaluate her brain activity. The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, and she is being managed with an insulin infusion.

The patient's medical team is actively involving the family in discussions about the goals of care. Once the patient's neurologic status is determined, a goals of care meeting will be held."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of hypertension who presented to the hospital with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). However, the patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest followed by a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and the patient was successfully resuscitated.

The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management. She received a tandemheart device in the catheterization lab, but it was partially retracted in the right atrium (RA), causing a shunt. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated.

Over the course of the next day, the patient's condition fluctuated. Her hemoglobin level dropped to 24% (from 36% in the morning), but hemolysis was not likely from the ECMO machine. The patient also had low platelet counts, leading to a suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), and appropriate measures were taken.

The patient's temperature was successfully warmed to 37°C using an arctic sun machine. Her central"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion.
   #Cardiogenic shock: Patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.
   s/p tandemheart and ECMO. Patient's heart appears to be able to
   accomplish some of the workload. Will wean tandem heart as tolerated.
   Issue at this point is respiratory failure and need for ECMO for proper
   oxygenation.
   - Continue tandemheart device with ECMO - once respiratory status
   improves wean
   - Titrate flow to MAP above 70
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Continue heparin gtt for tandemheart maintenance with goal ACT - 200
   - Consider transfusion if HD unstable
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recommendations
   - TTE today
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: New respiratory failure likely
   secondary to catheter migration from tandem heart device. Other
   respiratory failure may be secondary to acute congestive heart failure
   vs hemorrhage vs aspiration pneumonitis vs ARDS vs other. Respiratory
   status is a major factor in surgery decision. Will attempt to maxamize
   status over next couple of days.
   - treated with ECMO
   - CXR with worsened bilateral edema
   - ARDS net vent settings
   - Cover potential ventilator associated pneumonia with cefepime and
   vancomycin (day [**2-5**]), plan for 8 day course for VAP
   - Lasix gtt
   - CT torso
   - consider pulmonary consult if CXR/respiratory status not improved
   with diuresis
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology. Required 3u pRBCs yesterday. The patient
   had significant OP bleed. ENT evaluated and packed nasal and oral
   cavities. They will follow. Unlikely to explain total hct drop. Pt also
   has evidence of hemolysis, likely from external lines. RP bleed or GI
   bleed a possibility although no clear evidence for those as of yet.
   - trend, transfuse if rapidly dropping hct, signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u plts yesterday.
   Remained relatively stable over the course of the day. [**Month (only) 8**] be consumed
   secondary to catheters. Appears to early to be HIT and really need
   heparin at this point. Will continue to follow.
   - trend, transfuse for significant bleed
   # Neurologic status: definitive therapy is dependent on patient
   neurological status. Neurology has been unable to fully weigh in due to
   concerns of patient still being sedated. Will readdress issue every
   morning at 8 AM with neurology team. CT head to eval for insult since
   L>R spontaneous movement.
   - continue to wean sedation as tolerated
   - await EEG results
   - appreciate neurology recommendations
   - CT head
   # Nutrtion: will start tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   # Cardiac Arrest: ?ventricular fibrillation (prior to OSH) likely
   secondary to severe acidosis.
   - no need for further anti-arrhythmics as patient
s acidosis is now
   corrected with tandemheart and ECMO
   - currently on amiodarone for Afib RVR
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis
   - await further clarification of patient
s neurologic status before
   progressing to CABG for definitive therapy.
   # Lactic acidosis
 resolved on ECMO
   # Hyperglycemia - No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol
   - Continue insulin gtt.
    # Goals of care
 will continue to actively involve the family to
   address goals of care. Once neuro status determined will have goals of
   care meeting.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented to the hospital with syncope and chest pain. A cardiac catheterization revealed significant stenosis in the left main artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent percutaneous intervention with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LAD and LCx arteries. However, she experienced ventricular tachycardia with shock and subsequent cardiogenic shock. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated, and the patient became bradycardic, requiring atropine administration. She then experienced pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with medications. A tandemheart was placed in the cath lab, but it caused a shunt, and ECMO was initiated. The patient required transfusions due to hematocrit and platelet drops.

The patient's current condition includes cardiogenic shock, hypoxemic respiratory failure, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. There are ongoing efforts to wean the tandemheart device and ECMO as tolerated. The respiratory status is a major factor in determining surgical decisions, and there are concerns about potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's neurologic status is unclear, and further evaluation is needed. The patient also has hyperglycemia, which is being managed with insulin."

   s/p tandemheart and ECMO. Patient's heart appears to be able to
   accomplish some of the workload. Will wean tandem heart as tolerated.
   Issue at this point is respiratory failure and need for ECMO for proper
   oxygenation.
   - Continue tandemheart device with ECMO - once respiratory status
   improves wean
   - Titrate flow to MAP above 70
   - Wean dopamine as tolerated
   - Continue heparin gtt for tandemheart maintenance with goal ACT - 200
   - Consider transfusion if HD unstable
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recommendations
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: New respiratory failure likely
   secondary to catheter migration from tandem heart device. Other
   respiratory failure may be secondary to acute congestive heart failure
   vs hemorrhage vs aspiration pneumonitis vs ARDS vs other. Respiratory
   status is a major factor in surgery decision. Will attempt to maxamize
   status over next couple of days.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old male who was transferred from OSH after experiencing syncope and chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed severe blockages in the left main artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient received percutaneous intervention (POBA) for these blockages but experienced ventricular tachycardia with shock in the cath lab. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated. The patient later experienced bradycardia and then a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed, and medications such as atropine, epinephrine, and lidocaine were administered. A tandemheart device was placed in the cath lab, but it was partially retracted into the right atrium, causing a shunt. ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was initiated. 

The patient's current condition is as follows: The patient is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with ECMO support. There is evidence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia of unclear etiology, requiring blood transfusions. The patient's neurological status is uncertain, and further evaluation is needed. The patient is also hyperglycemic.

   2. New pan acute sinus disease, as above, compared to the CT of
   [**2141-12-31**]. This
   may relate to ongoing intubation, however, clinical correlation to
   exclude
   infection is recommended.
   Echo [**2142-1-4**]
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to extensive
   severe anterior, lateral, and apical hypokinesis/akinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion.
   #Cardiogenic shock: Patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.
   Yesterday, patient
s ventilator support was increased and tandem heart
   was shut off transiently, showing unassisted cardiac output of
   3.4-3.5.  PaO2 and PaCO2 remained reasonable.
   - Continue heparin gtt for tandem heart maintenance with goal ACT - 200
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recommendations
   - try removal of tandem heart today if patient continues to demonstrate
   hemodynamic stability.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Thought to be due to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia and ARDS also on differential.  Patient does not
   meet ARDS criteria currently due to elevated wedge pressure but
   fulfills all other criteria. CXR showed improvement yesterday with
   aggressive diuresis, as did respiratory status yesterday on trial off
   of ECMO/tandem heart.
   -continue ECMO for now until removal of tandem heart.
   - CXR today to re-eval
   - ARDS net vent settings
   - Cover potential ventilator associated pneumonia with cefepime and
   vancomycin (day [**3-8**]), plan for 8 day course for VAP
   - Lasix gtt
   - CT torso final read pending.
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u pRBCs overnight. The patient
   had significant OP bleed. ENT evaluated and packed nasal and oral
   cavities. They will follow. Unlikely to explain total hct drop. Pt also
   has evidence of hemolysis, likely from external lines. No evidence of
   RP bleed on CT torso.
   - trend, transfuse if rapidly dropping hct, signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u plts overnight.
   Remained relatively stable over the course of the day. Likely secondary
   to mechanical lysis through tandem heart/echo. Appears to early to be
   HIT and really need heparin at this point. Will continue to follow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of severe anteriolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) leading to cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (POBA) of the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (LCx) arteries and experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) twice, requiring two defibrillation shocks. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. She developed bradycardia and then pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, which required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) measures. The patient was subsequently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to refractory cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition shows improvement in her hemodynamics and respiratory status. She is being weaned off the tandem heart support, with stable blood pressure and improved oxygenation. Her blood gases show a pH of 7.48, pCO2 of 40, pO2 of 74, HCO3 of 31, and base excess of 5. She continues to have rapid diuresis, with a negative fluid balance of 6.6 liters over 24 hours. Her hematocrit and platelet count have dropped, and she received transfusions of packed red blood cells (PR"

   1. No evidence for acute intracranial process. Please note, MRI is more
   sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.
   2. New pan acute sinus disease, as above, compared to the CT of
   [**2141-12-31**]. This
   may relate to ongoing intubation, however, clinical correlation to
   exclude
   infection is recommended.
   Echo [**2142-1-4**]
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to extensive
   severe anterior, lateral, and apical hypokinesis/akinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion.
   #Cardiogenic shock: Patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.
   Yesterday, patient
s ventilator support was increased and tandem heart
   was shut off transiently, showing unassisted cardiac output of
   3.4-3.5.  PaO2 and PaCO2 remained reasonable.
   - Continue heparin gtt for tandem heart maintenance with goal ACT - 200
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recommendations
   - try removal of tandem heart today if patient continues to demonstrate
   hemodynamic stability.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Thought to be due to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia and ARDS also on differential.  Patient does not
   meet ARDS criteria currently due to elevated wedge pressure but
   fulfills all other criteria. CXR showed improvement yesterday with
   aggressive diuresis, as did respiratory status yesterday on trial off
   of ECMO/tandem heart.
   -continue ECMO for now until removal of tandem heart.
   - CXR today to re-eval
   - ARDS net vent settings
   - Cover potential ventilator associated pneumonia with cefepime and
   vancomycin (day [**3-8**]), plan for 8 day course for VAP
   - Lasix gtt
   - CT torso final read pending.
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u pRBCs overnight. The patient
   had significant OP bleed. ENT evaluated and packed nasal and oral
   cavities. They will follow. Unlikely to explain total hct drop. Pt also
   has evidence of hemolysis, likely from external lines. No evidence of
   RP bleed on CT torso.
   - trend, transfuse if rapidly dropping hct, signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u plts overnight.
   Remained relatively stable over the course of the day. Likely secondary
   to mechanical lysis through tandem heart/echo. Appears to early to be
   HIT and really need heparin at this point. Will continue to follow.
   - trend, transfuse for significant bleed
   # Neurologic status: CT scan yesterday showed no evidence of acute
   infarction, although MRI is superior in detecting this.  Neurology has
   stated that it is not possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now
   moving all four extremities, responding as of yet to pain.
   -          appreciate neurology input.
   -          Will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrtion: continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - currently on amiodarone loading for Afib RVR
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis
   - family meeting yesterday with plan for further stabilization before
   progressing to CABG for definitive therapy.
   # Hyperglycemia - No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of severe anteriolateral ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), resulting in cardiogenic shock. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending (LAD) and circumflex (LCx) arteries, followed by ventricular tachycardia (VT) that required defibrillation in the catheterization lab.
- The patient was intubated due to respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated, but the patient became bradycardic and later experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest with return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after administration of atropine and epinephrine.
- The patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and a tandem heart was initiated. However, the tandem heart was partially retracted into the right atrium (RA), causing a shunt. ECMO was continued.
- The patient's hematocrit and platelet count dropped, requiring transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and platelets.

   Imaging: CT head [**2142-1-4**]
   1. No evidence for acute intracranial process. Please note, MRI is more
   sensitive for the detection of acute ischemia.
   2. New pan acute sinus disease, as above, compared to the CT of
   [**2141-12-31**]. This
   may relate to ongoing intubation, however, clinical correlation to
   exclude
   infection is recommended.
   Echo [**2142-1-4**]
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
   ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is severely depressed (LVEF= 30 %) secondary to extensive
   severe anterior, lateral, and apical hypokinesis/akinesis. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. Mild to moderate ([**12-2**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid
   valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no pericardial effusion.

   of
         commensal respiratory flora.
         GRAM NEGATIVE ROD(S).    SPARSE GROWTH.
   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion.
   #Cardiogenic shock: Patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.
   Yesterday, patient
s ventilator support was increased and tandem heart
   was shut off transiently, showing unassisted cardiac output of
   3.4-3.5.  PaO2 and PaCO2 remained reasonable.
   - Continue heparin gtt for tandem heart maintenance with goal ACT - 200
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recommendations
   - try removal of tandem heart today if patient continues to demonstrate
   hemodynamic stability.
   - pressors ready at bedside at time of removal.
   # Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Thought to be due to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia and ARDS also on differential.  Patient does not
   meet ARDS criteria currently due to elevated wedge pressure but
   fulfills all other criteria. CXR showed improvement yesterday with
   aggressive diuresis, as did respiratory status yesterday on trial off
   of ECMO/tandem heart.  Prelim read of CT torso shows bibasilar
   atelectasis, bilateral patchy infiltrates consistent with pulmonary
   edema or ARDS.
   -continue ECMO for now until removal of tandem heart.
   - CXR today to re-eval
   - ARDS net vent settings
   - Cover potential ventilator associated pneumonia with cefepime and
   vancomycin (day [**3-8**]), plan for 8 day course for VAP
   - Lasix gtt as tolerated, although will likely not tolerate after
   tandem heart removed.
   - CT torso final read pending.
   # Gram negative rods in sputum culture
   - will continue to cover broadly with cefepime, narrow coverage when
   speciation comes back.
   - consider discontinuing vancomycin.
   # Anemia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u pRBCs overnight. The patient
   had significant OP bleed. ENT evaluated and packed nasal and oral
   cavities. They will follow. Unlikely to explain total hct drop. Pt also
   has evidence of hemolysis, likely from external lines. No evidence of
   RP bleed on CT torso.
   - trend, transfuse if rapidly dropping hct, signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Required 1u plts overnight.
   Remained relatively stable over the course of the day. Likely secondary
   to mechanical lysis through tandem heart/echo. Appears to early to be
   HIT and really need heparin at this point. Will continue to follow.
   - trend, transfuse for significant bleed
   # Neurologic status: CT scan yesterday showed no evidence of acute
   infarction, although MRI is superior in detecting this.  Neurology has
   stated that it is not possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now
   moving all four extremities, responding as of yet minimally only to
   voice, more to pain.
   -          appreciate neurology input.
   -          Will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition: continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - currently on amiodarone loading for Afib RVR
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis
   - family meeting yesterday with plan for further stabilization before
   progressing to CABG for definitive therapy.
   #Dusky left leg
 will pull arterial femoral sheath today with removal
   of tandem heart.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
 re-consult ENT for further
   management.
   # Hyperglycemia - No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol.  Study drug now stopped as not on
   pressors.
   - Stop insulin gtt
    # Goals of care
 will continue to actively involve the family to
   address goals of care as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with severe anteriolateral STEMI, leading to cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention with balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) and was resuscitated twice in the cath lab. She was intubated due to respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. The patient's condition deteriorated further, resulting in a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) protocols. After successful resuscitation, the patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and a tandem heart support due to severe hemodynamic instability. However, the tandem heart was partially retracted, causing a shunt. The patient's hematocrit and platelet count dropped, necessitating blood transfusions. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 88/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and sinus rhythm. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 300 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of chest pain and cardiac catheterization, which showed significant blockage in her left main artery and left anterior descending artery. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but experienced cardiogenic shock and ventricular tachycardia, leading to cardiac arrest. She was resuscitated and received a tandemheart (a temporary mechanical heart) and ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) support. After removal of the tandemheart and ECMO, she continues to require multiple pressors for hemodynamic support and is currently in sinus rhythm but has had episodes of atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's initial presentation and subsequent cardiac arrest indicate a severe impairment of the heart's pumping function. This condition can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential end-organ damage.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is closely monitored due to concerns of pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) need to be considered. Appropriate management strategies like decreasing tidal volume and maintaining FiO2 levels need to be implemented.

3. Gram-negative rods in sputum culture: The presence of gram-negative rods in the sputum culture suggests a possible hospital-acquired pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain, and underwent cardiac catheterization showing significant coronary artery disease. She experienced multiple episodes of ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity arrest, requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation and advanced cardiac support with tandemheart and ECMO. The patient's condition improved, and the tandemheart and ECMO were removed. However, she remains on multiple pressors for hemodynamic support and is currently in sinus rhythm after conversion from atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic Shock: The patient has a history of cardiogenic shock following a pulseless electrical activity arrest, which required advanced cardiac support. There is ongoing concern for the need to maintain hemodynamic support with pressors.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although the respiratory status has improved, ongoing monitoring and support are required.
3. Infection: The patient has positive cultures for gram-negative rods in the sputum and urine, suggesting a possible hospital-acquired infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and specific coverage will be adjusted based on culture results.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia with an unclear etiology. It is important to monitor the hemoglobin level and consider transfusion if there is significant blood loss or signs of hypoper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of syncope, chest pain, and severe coronary artery disease. She underwent a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but experienced a ventricular tachycardia arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She was intubated due to respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring multiple pressors, including amiodarone and phenylephrine. She is currently on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) and has had a tandemheart placed. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 103/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is sedated with propofol and receiving tube feeds.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure or other causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The CXR shows stable findings.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was in cardiogenic shock after the PEA arrest and is currently on multiple pressors for pressure support. Weaning of phenylephrine may be possible when off propofol.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to an infectious process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, but the dosage may have been inadequate. Additional cultures should be obtained, and the antibiotic coverage may need to be narrowed if the cultures return positive.
4. Anemia: The etiology of the anemia is unclear, but there has been some bleeding from the oral procedure, although it does not appear to be a large volume. ENT is aware of the patient's condition.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The cause of thrombocytopenia is unclear, but it may be related to the tandemheart/ECMO. Platelet transfusion should be considered if there is significant bleeding.
6. Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status is poor, with minimal responsiveness. An MRI would be superior in detecting any acute infarction.
7. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is on amiodarone for atrial fibrillation. It is important to keep beta-adrenergics at a minimum if possible.
8. STEMI: The patient continues to have severe LAD and left main stenosis, and the decision between PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) needs to be made.

Other considerations:
1. The patient has a dusky left leg, which improved with the removal of the arterial femoral sheath.
2. Epistaxis and oropharynx bleeding"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - amiodarone and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respirtory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential. The patient does not
   meet ARDS criteria although difficult to exclude. CXR is stable. [**1-6**]
   patient became tachypenic to 40, seemed agitated. Started sedation with
   propofol. Required relatively high doses which dropped pressures
   requiring us to start phenylephrine.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - maintain FiO2 < 0.6
   - d/c propofol, start fentanyl and versed - hopefully will require less
   to sedate
   - CXR today
   - cont cefepime and vancomycin day [**5-8**] (although increased cefepime
   dose, may have been under treating)
   - f/u vanc trough
   - diurese as tolerated
   - frequent ABG
   #. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA
   arrest. S/p removal of ECMO and tendemheart. Currently on multiple
   pressors for pressure support. Hopefully will be able to wean
   phenylephrine when off propofol.
   - change sedation as above
   - continue vasopressin
   - wean phenylephrine aggressively
   - continue heparin gtt
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recs
   - PCI vs CABG
   #. Leukocytosis: In the setting fevers if worrisome for infectious
   process. Currently on broad spectrum abx although have been underdosed.
   Should consider extended course due to this. C.Diff sent and negative
   x1. [**Month (only) 8**] also be due to inflammatory process of some type.
   - f/u blood cx
   - f/u sputum cx
   - f/u urine cx
   - consider additional c. diff cxs
   - consider narrowing abx coverage if cx return positive
   #. Anemia: Unclear etiology. Some bleeding from OP although doesn't
   appear to be large volume. ENT aware of patient and will stop by if
   asked. CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandemheart
   now removed.
   - trend hct
   - transfuse if evidence of bleed or signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to
   tandemheart/ecmo. Now improving.
   - trend plt
   - transfuse for significant bleed
   #. Neurologic status: CT scan yesterday showed no evidence of acute
   infarction, although MRI is superior in detecting this.  Neurology has
   stated that it is not possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now
   moving all four extremities, responding as of yet minimally only to
   voice, more to pain. Exam will be limited due to need for sedation.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition: continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - currently on amiodarone loading for Afib RVR
   - cont po amio
   - attempt to keep beta adrenergics at a minimum if possible
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis - PCI
   vs CABG
   - family meeting yesterday
   #Dusky left leg
 pulled arterial femoral sheath with improvement of
   blood flow to legs.
   - will follow
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
 re-consult ENT for further
   management.
   - ENT will follow in needed
   # Hyperglycemia - No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] be on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol.  Study drug now stopped as not on
   pressors.
   - Stop insulin gtt

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain. She has a history of severe left main coronary artery disease and left anterior descending artery stenosis. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty of the LAD and LCx arteries, but experienced ventricular tachycardia with subsequent shock and cardiogenic shock. She was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. The patient also received a tandemheart in the cath lab, but it was partially retracted into the right atrium, causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated, and later removed along with the tandemheart. The patient required multiple pressors, including amiodarone and phenylephrine.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely suffering from pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes, such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are also considered. The patient's chest X-ray is stable, and she is being sedated with propofol due to agitation and tachypnea.

2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was in cardiogenic shock after experiencing a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She is currently on multiple pressors for pressure support and is expected to be weaned off phenylephrine once off"

   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - amiodarone and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respirtory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential. The patient does not
   meet ARDS criteria although difficult to exclude. CXR is stable. [**1-6**]
   patient became tachypenic to 40, seemed agitated. Started sedation with
   propofol. Required relatively high doses which dropped pressures
   requiring us to start phenylephrine.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - maintain FiO2 < 0.6
   - d/c propofol, start fentanyl and versed if needed - hopefully will
   require less to sedate
   - CXR today
   - cont cefepime and vancomycin day [**5-8**] (although increased cefepime
   dose, may have been under treating)
   - f/u vanc trough
   - diurese as tolerated
   - frequent ABG
   #. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA
   arrest. S/p removal of ECMO and tendemheart. Currently on multiple
   pressors for pressure support. Hopefully will be able to wean
   phenylephrine when off propofol.
   - change sedation as above
   - continue vasopressin
   - wean phenylephrine aggressively
   - continue heparin gtt
   - appreciate cardiac surgery recs
   - PCI vs CABG
   - consider beta blocker
   #. Leukocytosis: In the setting fevers if worrisome for infectious
   process. Currently on broad spectrum abx although have been underdosed.
   Should consider extended course due to this. C.Diff sent and negative
   x1. [**Month (only) 8**] also be due to inflammatory process of some type.
   - f/u blood cx
   - f/u sputum cx
   - f/u urine cx
   - consider additional c. diff cxs
   - consider narrowing abx coverage if cx return positive
   - remove CVL - replace
   #. Anemia: Unclear etiology. Some bleeding from OP although doesn't
   appear to be large volume. ENT aware of patient and will stop by if
   asked. CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandemheart
   now removed.
   - trend hct
   - transfuse if evidence of bleed or signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology. Likely secondary to
   tandemheart/ecmo. Now improving.
   - trend plt
   - transfuse for significant bleed
   #. Neurologic status: CT scan yesterday showed no evidence of acute
   infarction, although MRI is superior in detecting this.  Neurology has
   stated that it is not possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now
   moving all four extremities, responding as of yet minimally only to
   voice, more to pain. Exam will be limited due to need for sedation.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition: continue tube feeds per nutrition recs.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - currently on amiodarone loading for Afib RVR
   - cont po amio
   - attempt to keep beta adrenergics at a minimum if possible
   # STEMI: patient continues have severe LAD and left main stenosis - PCI

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in her left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. She received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the left circumflex artery but experienced two ventricular tachycardia shocks during the procedure and subsequently became hemodynamically unstable.

The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated, and she was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to cardiac arrest and ventricular tachycardia with pulseless electrical activity (PEA). ECMO was removed and a tandem heart was implanted, but it was partially retracted into the right atrium, causing a shunt. The tandem heart was also removed, and the patient is now on multiple vasopressors.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), possibly secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or direct lung injury.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient was in cardiogenic shock after the PEA arrest and is currently on multiple pressors for pressure support. It is hoped that phenylephrine can be weaned when"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and chest pain. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe blockages in her coronary arteries, leading to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with ventricular support. The patient developed bradycardia, then pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). ECMO and tandem heart were initiated, but ECMO was eventually removed due to a shunt. The patient required multiple pressors, including amiodarone and phenylephrine, and is currently on vasopressin and phenylephrine.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient likely has pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also possible. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria, but it is difficult to exclude. Chest X-ray is stable, and the patient has been sedated with propofol.
2. Sepsis: The patient demonstrates sepsis physiology with decent cardiac output but low systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Klebsiella pneumonia is suspected as the source of infection, which grew despite the patient being on cefepime. The central line has been replaced, and pan-culture has been obtained. Antibiotics have been adjusted to cover possible extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ES"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria although
   difficult to exclude.  Continues on sedation with propofol, requiring
   phenylephrine.  Failed 3 pressure support trials.  Increased O2
   requirment this AM.  Respiratory failure may be partially secondary to
   pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella pneumonia.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - CT chest (while doing CT abdomen for pancreatitis / acalculus
   cholecystitis eval)
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Consider also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Likely source is pneumonia as sputum has grown out klebsiella x3,
   pan-sensitive, but concerning because this bacterium grew while patient
   on cefepime (underdosed).  Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on
   [**1-4**]. Pt continues to have increasing leukocytosis.  C diff negative.
   Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID
   consulted.  Abx switched from meropenum/cipro/vanc to vanc/zosyn.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and stable WBC.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -          continue vasopressin, phenylephrine as needed to maintain
   pressures.
   -  abdominal ultrasound to eval pancreas and gallbladder
   - CT abdomen/pelvis/sinus
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase 220. Started
   fentanyl boluses for comfort
   -          trend pancreatic enzymes
   -          abdominal ultrasound today
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          check triglycerides
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - continue vasopressin and phenylephrine
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG
   - low dose metoprolol 12.5mg tid
   #. Anemia:
   Unclear etiology.  Hct stable at 25.  Some bleeding from OP although
   doesn't appear to be large volume and appears to be dark, old blood.
   ENT aware of patient and will stop by if asked. CT torso without
   evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandemheart has been removed.
   - trending hct
   - transfuse if evidence of bleed or signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Neurologic status:
   CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarction, although MRI is
   superior in detecting this.  Neurology has stated that it is not
   possible to prognosticate currently.  She appeared to respond to voice
   yesterday, maybe tracking eyes but not moving extremities, responding
   minimally only to voice, more to pain.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   - family will try to use Tagalog phrases in case she lost her second
   language
   - consider LP in the future, though meningitis unlikely
   - CT Head (while getting CT sinus/abd/chest)
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   # Atrial fibrillation: -
   - continue on amiodarone per oral 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and switch to 200mg at end
   of week
   -          Beta blaocker as above.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.
   -          ISS
   -          Consider long acting insulin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiogenic shock, who was intubated and placed on ECMO for cardiac support. She developed hypoxemic respiratory failure and septic shock, likely secondary to pneumonia. She also has pancreatitis and acalculus cholecystitis. The patient has anemia of unclear etiology, neurologic impairment, atrial fibrillation, and hyperglycemia. Her current goals of care are DNR.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate further, leading to worsening hypoxia and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis and septic shock: The patient's infection and low blood pressure indicate a risk of sepsis progression, which can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's pancreatitis may worsen, resulting in further pain, systemic inflammation, and potential complications such as necrosis or abscess formation.
4. Acalculous cholecystitis: This condition may progress, leading to gallbladder inflammation and potential complications like gallbladder rupture.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and potential organ damage.
6. Neurologic impairment: The patient's neurological status may deteriorate, potentially leading to permanent disability or death.

   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respirtory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria although
   difficult to exclude.  Continues on sedation with propofol, requiring
   phenylephrine.  Failed 3 pressure support trials.  Increased O2
   requirment this AM.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Consider also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Likely source is pneumonia as sputum has grown out klebsiella x3,
   pan-sensitive, but concerning because this bacterium grew while patient
   on cefepime (underdosed).  Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on
   [**1-4**]. Pt continues to have increasing leukocytosis.  C diff negative.
   Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID
   consulted.  Abx switched from meropenum/cipro/vanc to vanc/zosyn.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and stable WBC.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -          continue vasopressin, phenylephrine as needed to maintain
   pressures.
   -  abdominal ultrasound to eval pancreas and gallbladder
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase 220. Started
   fentanyl boluses for comfort
   -          trend pancreatic enzymes
   -          abdominal ultrasound today
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - continue vasopressin and phenylephrine
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG
   - low dose metoprolol 12.5mg tid
   #. Anemia:
   Unclear etiology.  Hct stable at 25.  Some bleeding from OP although
   doesn't appear to be large volume and appears to be dark, old blood.
   ENT aware of patient and will stop by if asked. CT torso without
   evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandemheart has been removed.
   - trending hct
   - transfuse if evidence of bleed or signs of hypoperfusion
   #. Neurologic status:
   CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarction, although MRI is
   superior in detecting this.  Neurology has stated that it is not
   possible to prognosticate currently.  She appeared to respond to voice
   yesterday, maybe tracking eyes but not moving extremities, responding
   minimally only to voice, more to pain.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   - family will try to use Tagalog phrases in case she lost her second
   language
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   # Atrial fibrillation: -
   - continue on amiodarone per oral 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and switch to 200mg at end
   of week
   -          Beta blaocker as above.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain. She was found to have significant coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) twice during the procedure and was intubated for respiratory distress. She also had a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The tandem heart was attempted but partially retracted, causing a shunt.

The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also considered.

2. Distributive shock: The patient is demonstrating sepsis physiology with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and increasing leukocytosis. Klebsiella pneumoniae has been cultured from sputum samples multiple times, indicating a possible source of infection. The patient's central line has been replaced, and antibiotics have been switched.

   however
   there is development of small fluid collections anterior to the body
   and at
   the tail of the pancreas, which may represent early developing
   pancreatic
   pseudocyst. No definite evidence for abscess.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis have improved.
   However, bilateral ground glass opacities and right middle lobe
   opacities have
   worsened. Findings may be due to ARDS or worsening pneumonia.
   3. Dilation of the CBD may reflect papillary stenosis.
   [**2142-1-9**] RUQ ultrasound:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 1976**] evidence of cholecystitis.
   2. No peripancreatic fluid collections.
   3. Right pleural effusion and dilated IVC/intrahepatic veins may
   suggest a
   component of congestive heart failure.
   CT head:
   No evidence of intracranial bleed or large infarct
   Paranasal sinus disease related to intubation.
   Microbiology: [**2142-1-8**] sputum: klebsiella, no sensitivities performed.

   Cdiff negative x3
   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria although
   difficult to exclude.  Continues on sedation with propofol, requiring
   phenylephrine.  Failed 3 pressure support trials.  Increased O2
   requirment this AM.  Respiratory failure may be partially secondary to
   pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella pneumonia.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - CT chest (while doing CT abdomen for pancreatitis / acalculus
   cholecystitis eval)
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Consider also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Likely source is pneumonia as sputum has grown out klebsiella x3,
   pan-sensitive, but concerning because this bacterium grew while patient
   on cefepime (underdosed).  Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on
   [**1-4**]. Pt continues to have increasing leukocytosis.  C diff negative.
   Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID
   consulted.  Abx switched from meropenum/cipro/vanc to vanc/zosyn.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and stable WBC.  Re-scan shows
   no evidence of an abscess, however there is potential early pseudocyst
   formation in the pancreas.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -          continue vasopressin, phenylephrine as needed to maintain
   pressures.
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase 220. Started
   fentanyl boluses for comfort.  Triglyceride level normal.  Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of duct dilation or cholecyctitis.
   Pancreatic enzymes remain even.
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          will consider advancing NG tube past ligament of treitz to
   restart tube feeds.
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine has now gone up to 1.5 from
   1.0 on admission.  This is concerning as along with her pancreatitis,
   she may now be in MODS. Still currently making urine at approximately
   40cc an hour.
   -          will transfuse with 1 unit blood to improve kidney
   perfusion.
   -          Check urine lytes.

   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - continue vasopressin and phenylephrine
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG
   - low dose metoprolol 12.5mg tid
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart has
   been removed.  New crit drop today to 23.8, given ongoing sepsis this
   is concerning for potential DIC.
   - check haptoglobin, fibrinogen levels.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   #. Neurologic status:
   CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarction, although MRI is
   superior in detecting this.  Neurology has stated that it is not
   possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now responding much more
   vigorously to voice, turning her head and opening eyes, tracking.
   However still not able to move extremities.  CT head shows no evidence
   of stroke.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   - family will try to use Tagalog phrases in case she lost her second
   language
   - consider LP in the future, though meningitis unlikely
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   -          will consider advancing NG tube to allow continued feeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. She presented with syncope and chest pain, and cardiac catheterization showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty to the left circumflex artery. However, she experienced two episodes of shock during the procedure and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with epinephrine administration. ECMO and tandem heart were initiated but eventually removed.

The patient was diagnosed with hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure. She also developed septic shock, possibly secondary to pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumonia growing from sputum cultures. The patient's condition has been complicated by pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic shock due to a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), anemia, and neurologic status changes.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.7°C
- Heart rate: 90 bpm
- Blood pressure: 100/47 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 29 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100%
- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): Not assessed

Laboratory results show:

   Imaging: CT body [**2142-1-9**]:
   1. Uniform enhancement of the pancreas without evidence for necrosis
   however
   there is development of small fluid collections anterior to the body
   and at
   the tail of the pancreas, which may represent early developing
   pancreatic
   pseudocyst. No definite evidence for abscess.
   2. Bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis have improved.
   However, bilateral ground glass opacities and right middle lobe
   opacities have
   worsened. Findings may be due to ARDS or worsening pneumonia.
   3. Dilation of the CBD may reflect papillary stenosis.
   [**2142-1-9**] RUQ ultrasound:
   1. No son[**Name (NI) 1976**] evidence of cholecystitis.
   2. No peripancreatic fluid collections.
   3. Right pleural effusion and dilated IVC/intrahepatic veins may
   suggest a
   component of congestive heart failure.
   CT head:
   No evidence of intracranial bleed or large infarct
   Paranasal sinus disease related to intubation.
   Microbiology: [**2142-1-8**] sputum: klebsiella, no sensitivities performed.
   [**2142-1-9**]: legionella antigen pending.
   Cdiff negative x3
   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria although
   difficult to exclude.  Continues on sedation with propofol, requiring
   phenylephrine.  Failed 3 pressure support trials.  Increased O2
   requirment this AM.  Respiratory failure may be partially secondary to
   pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella pneumonia.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - CT chest (while doing CT abdomen for pancreatitis / acalculus
   cholecystitis eval)
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Consider also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Likely source is pneumonia as sputum has grown out klebsiella x3,
   pan-sensitive, but concerning because this bacterium grew while patient
   on cefepime (underdosed).  Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on
   [**1-4**]. Pt continues to have increasing leukocytosis.  C diff negative.
   Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID
   consulted.  Abx switched from meropenum/cipro/vanc to vanc/zosyn.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and stable WBC.  Re-scan shows
   no evidence of an abscess, however there is potential early pseudocyst
   formation in the pancreas.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -          continue vasopressin, phenylephrine as needed to maintain
   pressures.
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase 220. Started
   fentanyl boluses for comfort.  Triglyceride level normal.  Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of duct dilation or cholecyctitis.
   Pancreatic enzymes remain even.
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          will consider advancing NG tube past ligament of treitz to
   restart tube feeds.
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine has now gone up to 1.5 from
   1.0 on admission.  This is concerning as along with her pancreatitis,
   she may now be in MODS. Still currently making urine at approximately
   40cc an hour.
   - will transfuse with 1 unit blood to improve kidney perfusion.
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - continue vasopressin and phenylephrine
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG
   - low dose metoprolol 12.5mg tid
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart has
   been removed.  New crit drop today to 23.8, given ongoing sepsis this
   is concerning for potential DIC.
   - check haptoglobin, fibrinogen levels.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   #. Neurologic status:
   CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarction, although MRI is
   superior in detecting this.  Neurology has stated that it is not
   possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now responding much more
   vigorously to voice, turning her head and opening eyes, tracking.
   However still not able to move extremities.  CT head shows no evidence
   of stroke.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   - family will try to use Tagalog phrases in case she lost her second
   language
   - consider LP in the future, though meningitis unlikely
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   - will consider advancing NG tube to allow continued feeding.
   # Atrial fibrillation: -
   - continue on amiodarone per oral 400mg [**Hospital1 **] and switch to 200mg at end
   of week
   -          Beta blocker as above.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.
   -          ISS
   -          Consider long acting insulin.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of syncope episode and chest pain, who was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a cardiac catheterization procedure. She had a heart attack with 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis, and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty of the LAD and LCx arteries. Subsequently, she developed bradycardia and ventricular tachycardia, resulting in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and tandem heart support. The patient's condition has been unstable, with episodes of hypoxemic respiratory failure, distributive shock, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, cardiogenic shock, anemia, and neurologic status changes.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 100/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. She is also receiving vasop"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 mintes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential. The patient does not meet ARDS criteria although
   difficult to exclude.  Continues on sedation with propofol, requiring
   phenylephrine.  Failed 3 pressure support trials.  Increased O2
   requirment this AM.  Respiratory failure may be partially secondary to
   pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella pneumonia.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - CT chest (while doing CT abdomen for pancreatitis / acalculus
   cholecystitis eval)
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Consider also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Likely source is pneumonia as sputum has grown out klebsiella x3,
   pan-sensitive, but concerning because this bacterium grew while patient
   on cefepime (underdosed).  Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on
   [**1-4**]. Pt continues to have increasing leukocytosis.  C diff negative.
   Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID
   consulted.  Abx switched from meropenum/cipro/vanc to vanc/zosyn.
   Increased pressor requirement overnight and stable WBC.  Re-scan shows
   no evidence of an abscess, however there is potential early pseudocyst
   formation in the pancreas.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -          continue vasopressin, phenylephrine as needed to maintain
   pressures.
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase 220. Started
   fentanyl boluses for comfort.  Triglyceride level normal.  Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of duct dilation or cholecyctitis.
   Pancreatic enzymes remain even.
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          will consider advancing NG tube past ligament of treitz to
   restart tube feeds.
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine has now gone up to 1.5 from
   1.0 on admission.  This is concerning as along with her pancreatitis,
   she may now be in MODS. Still currently making urine at approximately
   40cc an hour.
   -          will transfuse with 1 unit blood to improve kidney
   perfusion.
   -          Check urine lytes.
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - continue vasopressin and phenylephrine
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG
   - low dose metoprolol 12.5mg tid
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart has
   been removed.  New crit drop today to 23.8, given ongoing sepsis this
   is concerning for potential DIC.
   - check haptoglobin, fibrinogen levels.
   - will transfuse 1 unit PRBCs
   #. Neurologic status:
   CT scan showed no evidence of acute infarction, although MRI is
   superior in detecting this.  Neurology has stated that it is not
   possible to prognosticate currently.  She is now responding much more
   vigorously to voice, turning her head and opening eyes, tracking.
   However still not able to move extremities.  CT head shows no evidence
   of stroke.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   - family will try to use Tagalog phrases in case she lost her second
   language
   - consider LP in the future, though meningitis unlikely
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   -          will consider advancing NG tube to allow continued feeding.
   -          Consider TPN.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - has not been in afib recently
   - will discontinue given potential for pancreatic toxicity.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of myocardial infarction, who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. However, she experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the procedure, resulting in cardiac arrest and resuscitation attempts.

The patient was subsequently intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She required hemodynamic support with dopamine and later transitioned to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). After ECMO removal, the patient continued to require multiple vasopressors for hemodynamic stability.

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, possibly secondary to pulmonary edema or pneumonia. She also exhibits signs of sepsis with leukocytosis and positive sputum cultures for Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has elevated liver enzymes, elevated lipase, and evidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), with a rising creatinine level.

The patient's neurological status is a concern, as she is currently unresponsive with no movement of extremities. However, there are no findings of acute stroke on the CT scan.

Other issues include pancreatitis with elevated triglycerides and lipase levels, anemia with a low hematocrit, and hyperglycemia. The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled, but she continues to require vasop"

   pressure support yesterday, albeit on high support.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own.
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - talk with interventional pulmonary about potential tracheostomy as
   patient is getting close to two weeks with endotracheal tube in place,
   depending on family meeting on goals of care.
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of syncope episode, chest pain, and cardiac catheterization that showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for LAD and LCx with ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the procedure. She was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated. Subsequently, she experienced bradycardia, pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and VT arrest. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed with epinephrine and lidocaine administration. ECMO was initiated due to inadequate cardiac output. The patient's condition has been complicated by hypoxemic respiratory failure, septic shock, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiogenic shock secondary to STEMI, anemia, and neurologic status changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure or other causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Septic shock: The patient is showing signs of sepsis physiology with low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), suggesting distributive shock. Klebsiella pneumonia has been identified in her sputum cultures, indicating a possible"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 minutes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.   Has been off sedation all night.   Failed 3 pressure
   support trials.  O2 requirement decreased this AM.  Respiratory failure
   may be partially secondary to pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella
   pneumonia.  Family decided against Tracheostomy yesterday.  Today is
   Day#14 of intubation.  Urine output high with lasix gtt but overall
   even I/Os for 24hrs because of TPN volume.  Tapping effusions high risk
   while on PEEP 10.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own again today
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue diuresis
   # Distributive shock:
   Patient is now demonstrating sepsis physiology with decent cardiac
   output but low SVR, likely septic, but consider that it may be
   secondary to pancreatitis.  Considered also acalculus cholecystitis.
   Patient has grown out klebsiella x3 in sputum, pan-sensitive, but this
   may not have been cause of septic shock.  Abscess unlikely because of
   negative CT on [**1-4**]. Leukocytosis persists.  C diff negative.  Central
   line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again yesterday.  ID consulted.
   Abx switched back to meropenum/cipro/vanc.  Re-scan shows no evidence
   of an abscess, however there is potential early pseudocyst formation in
   the pancreas.  Consider eval for empyema.  Pressors weaned off last
   night.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -    trend WBC and fever curve
   - cont meropenem/ cipro / vanc
   - f/u beta-glucan, galactomannan ; consider starting micafungin if not
   improving
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase increasing.
   Getting fentanyl boluses for comfort.  Triglyceride level normal.
   Abdominal ultrasound shows no evidence of duct dilation or
   cholecyctitis.  Pancreatic enzymes remain even.
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          continue TPN
   -          family decided against PEG tube
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine elevated to 2, stable from yesterday, elevated
   from 1.0 on admission.  This is concerning as along with her
   pancreatitis, she may now be in MODS.   Made good urine w lasix gtt
   overnight.  Pressors have been weaned off overnight
   -          continue lasix gtt
   -          family preferred not to do CVVH
   -          Renally dose medications, check vancomycin trough.
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - no longer requiring pressors
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG if recovers
   - holding metoprolol to allow pressures to improve
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart has
   been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as needed.  Hct
   stable for now
   -          Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - appreciate neurology input
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   -          Continue TPN.
   # Atrial fibrillation: - has not been in afib recently
   - DCed amio given potential for pancreatic toxicity.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.
   -          ISS
   -          Consider long acting insulin.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for significant blockages in her coronary arteries. The patient experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest during the procedure and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). She was then placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to cardiac dysfunction.

The patient developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, which is likely secondary to pulmonary edema, acute congestive heart failure, or pneumonia. She has been intubated for 14 days and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The family decided against tracheostomy. The patient's urine output has been high with the use of lasix gtt, and overall even I/Os for 24 hours due to TPN volume.

The patient also presented with distributive shock, sepsis physiology with decent cardiac output but low systemic vascular resistance (SVR), likely due to septic shock or pancreatitis. Klebsiella pneumonia has been cultured multiple times, and the patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. A central line infection was identified and treated.

The patient has been diagnosed with pancreatitis, with elevated lipase levels and pain upon abdominal examination. There is a potential early pseudocyst formation in the pancreas."

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 minutes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. [**1-3**] hematocrit
   and plt drop requiring transfusion. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Requiring multiple pressors - vasopressin and phenylephrine.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.   Has been off sedation all night.   Failed 3 pressure
   support trials in past week and had difficulty this morning.  O2
   requirement decreased this AM.  Respiratory failure may be partially
   secondary to pneumonia.  Has known Klebsiella pneumonia.  Family
   decided against Tracheostomy yesterday.  Today is Day#13 of
   intubation.  Urine output high with lasix gtt but overall even I/Os for
   24hrs because of TPN volume.  Tapping effusions high risk while on PEEP
   10.
   - maintain tidal volume in ARDS net goals
   - will attempt pressure support trial to see if patient is able to
   maintain ventilation on her own again today
   - wean as tolerated
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - continue diuresis w DCed TPN
   - family meeting again re: change in pt
s mental status and whether
   Tracheostomy might now be appropriate
   # Distributive shock:
   Sepsis physiology with now improving, weaned off pressors last night.
   consider that it may be secondary to pancreatitis or acalculus
   cholecystitis.  Patient has grown out klebsiella x3 in sputum,
   pan-sensitive, but this may not have been cause of septic shock.
   Abscess unlikely because of negative CT on [**1-4**]. Leukocytosis persists.
   C diff negative.  Central line replaced on [**2142-1-7**].  Pan-cultured again
   yesterday.  ID consulted.  Abx switched back to meropenum/cipro/vanc.
   Re-scan shows no evidence of an abscess, however there is potential
   early pseudocyst formation in the pancreas.  Consider eval for
   empyema.  Pressors weaned off last night.
   -          f/u sputum culture w new sensitivities
   -    trend WBC and fever curve
   - cont meropenem/ cipro / vanc
   - f/u beta-glucan, galactomannan ; consider starting micafungin if not
   improving but hold off for now
   .
   # Pancreatitis:
   Patient grimaced in pain when abdomen pressed.  Lipase increasing.
   Getting fentanyl boluses for comfort.  Triglyceride level normal.
   Abdominal ultrasound shows no evidence of duct dilation or
   cholecyctitis.  Pancreatic enzymes remain even.
   -          continue fentanyl boluses as needed and NPO (no tube feeds)
   except meds
   -          consult GI
   -          Hold statin
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine elevated to 2, stable from yesterday, elevated
   from 1.0 on admission.  This is concerning as along with her
   pancreatitis, she may now be in MODS.   Made good urine w lasix gtt
   overnight.  Pressors have been weaned off overnight. CVVH may not be
   necessary b/c diuresing well w lasix drip.
   -          continue lasix gtt and increase metolazone dose to [**Hospital1 **]
   -          Renally dose medications, check vancomycin trough
   -          DC TPN to help w diuresis
   .
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI:
   The patient was in cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. S/p removal of
   ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively resolved after stunned myocardium
   had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - no longer requiring pressors
   - continue heparin gtt for potential LV thrombus.
   - PCI vs CABG when stable ; might need MVR if got CABG if recovers well
   - Continue metoprolol as BPs can tolerate
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart has
   been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as needed.  Hct
   stable for now
   -          Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   -          Holding TPN and tube feeds
   # Atrial fibrillation: - has not been in afib recently
   - DCed amio given potential for pancreatic toxicity.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of myocardial infarction and subsequent cardiogenic shock, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and hypotension. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention, during which she experienced two ventricular tachycardia episodes. The patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress. She developed septic shock, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, and required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including respiratory failure, sepsis, pancreatitis, and acute kidney injury. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and requires mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure, as well as other possibilities such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Distributive shock: The patient initially presented with septic shock, which has partially improved. There is a possibility of ongoing infection, particularly with the presence of Klebsiella pneumonia. Other potential causes of distributive shock include pancreatitis or acalculous cholecystitis.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has elevated lipase levels and abdominal pain, suggesting acute pancreatitis. This condition may contribute to systemic inflammation and further"

The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia, cardiac arrest, and required resuscitation efforts. She was intubated for respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated. The patient had a bradycardic episode and received atropine. She developed pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest and underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with medications. A tandem heart was placed, but it caused a shunt, leading to the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO and tandem heart were eventually removed, and the patient's pressors were weaned off. The patient's mental status improved, and a tracheostomy was placed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient failed a pressure support trial due to tachypnea but diuresed well yesterday and was able to wean vent settings. Tidal volumes should be maintained at ARDS net goals, vent settings should be weaned as tolerated, a trial of pressure support should be"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who was transferred from another hospital with symptoms of syncope, chest pain, and cardiac catheterization showing significant blockages in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting in the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery. However, she experienced ventricular tachycardia with shock, leading to intubation and initiation of hypothermia protocol. The patient's condition deteriorated, resulting in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was performed. She received atropine, epinephrine, and lidocaine during resuscitation. A tandem heart was implanted, but it had to be removed due to a shunt. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated, and the patient's pressors were weaned off. Tracheostomy was placed, and mental status improved.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Management includes maintaining tidal volumes at ARDS net goals, weaning vent settings as tolerated, trial of pressure support again, following up with cultures, continuing antibiotics, aggressive diuresis, and trache"

   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 minutes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of
   ECMO and tandem heart. Weaned pressors. Improved mental status. Trach
   placed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of a syncope episode, chest pain, and cardiac catheterization showing significant coronary artery disease. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) but experienced a ventricular tachycardia (VT) arrest during the procedure and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). ECMO was initiated due to cardiac dysfunction, but it was later removed. The patient was weaned off pressors and showed improvement in mental status. A tracheostomy was placed.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress, likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure. Other possibilities include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She failed a pressure support trial due to tachypnea but diuresed well yesterday and was able to wean vent settings. Another trial of pressure support is planned.

2. Distributive shock: The patient was previously in distributive shock but has been weaned off pressors and is doing better. She is currently on antibiotics and is being monitored closely. Micafungin may be considered in the future.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has been in atrial fibrillation for the past two nights. Amiodarone may need to be restarted, and electrolytes should be repleted as needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 minutes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of
   ECMO and tandem heart. Weaned pressors. Improved mental status. Trach
   placed.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.  Failed pressure
   support trial today due to tachypnea. Diuresed well yesterday and able
   to wean vent settings.
   - trial of pressure support again today.
   - less aggressive diuresis today
 trial with 40mg IV lasix [**Hospital1 **].
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Distributive shock: Weaned off pressors and doing better. Currnetly
   on antibiotcs. ID consulted. On meropenem, cipro and vanc. Consider
   micafungin in future.  White count decreasing.
   - continue meropenum cipro
   - follow up culture results
   - trend WBC, T
   - follow up beta-glucan and galactomannan
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been in atrial fibrillation last two
   nights. [**Month (only) 8**] need to restart amiodarone.
   - follow telemetry, not on amiodarone currently.
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase elevated. Getting fentanyl boluses for pain
   control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound shows no evidence of stones.
   GI consulted.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - restart tube feeds if GI agrees as pain on exam diminishing.
   - consider holding statin
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine elevated to 2, stable from
   yesterday, elevated from 1.0 on admission.  Made good urine w lasix gtt
   overnight.  Pressors have been weaned off, but restarted yesterday
   during episode of atrial fibrillation.
   - may need to give back some fluid with bicarb prior to potential
   Tuesday catherization.
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI: The patient was in cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest. S/p removal of ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively
   resolved after stunned myocardium had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - Echo showed improved MVR, plan for PCI in the future possibly
   Tuesday.
   - Continue metoprolol as BPs can tolerate
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem
   heart has been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as
   needed.  Hct stable for now
   -  Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status: Patient is now very responsive and participatory,
   moves toes and arms well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows
   no evidence of stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:  NPO for pancreatitis
   -  TPN today.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   -          ENT will follow if needed
   -          Appears resolved.
   # Hyperglycemia: No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains
   hyperglycemic however over past several days.

   Disposition: CCU
","The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain, and was found to have significant coronary artery disease during cardiac catheterization. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for left anterior descending artery stenosis and received a tandem heart device in the cath lab. However, the device was retracted and caused a shunt, leading to the initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 

The patient had a cardiac arrest and received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), atropine, epinephrine, and lidocaine. She was successfully resuscitated and removed from ECMO. She was weaned off pressors and showed improvement in mental status. A tracheostomy was placed.

The patient's current issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema or other causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She failed a pressure support trial due to tachypnea but diuresed well yesterday and was able to wean vent settings. Another trial of pressure support is planned today.

The patient also has distributive shock, for which she has been weaned off pressors and is currently on antibiotics. Her white blood cell count is decreasing, and she is being followed up with culture results. Micafungin may be considered in the future.

She is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which has been present for the past"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Had CPR for 2 minutes given 1mg atropine, 1mg epinephrine, 100
   of lidocaine. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of
   ECMO and tandem heart. Weaned pressors. Improved mental status. Trach
   placed.
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.  Failed pressure
   support trial today due to tachypnea. Diuresed well yesterday and able
   to wean vent settings.
   - trial of pressure support again today.
   - PO diuresis today - 80mg lasix, 5mg metolazone
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Distributive shock: Weaned off pressors and doing better. Currnetly
   on antibiotcs. ID consulted. On meropenem, cipro and vanc. Consider
   micafungin in future.  White count decreasing.
   - continue meropenum, cipro ([**3-10**])
   - check vanco level
   - trend WBC, T
   - follow up beta-glucan and galactomannan
   #. Cardiogenic shock , s/p STEMI: The patient was in cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest. S/p removal of ECMO and tendemheart. Now relatively
   resolved after stunned myocardium had chance to recover s/p STEMI.
   - Echo showed improved MVR
   - possible PCI tomorrow - need to discuss pre-hydration therapy
   - Continue metoprolol as BPs can tolerate
   #. Atrial fibrillation: [**Month (only) 8**] need to restart amiodarone if occurs in
   future.
   - follow telemetry, not on amiodarone currently.
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase elevated. Getting fentanyl boluses for pain
   control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound shows no evidence of stones.
   GI consulted.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - restart tube feeds if GI agrees
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine elevated to 2, stable from
   yesterday, elevated from 1.0 on admission.  Made good urine w lasix gtt
   overnight.  Pressors have been weaned off, but restarted yesterday
   during episode of atrial fibrillation.
   - may need to give back some fluid with bicarb prior to potential
   Tuesday catherization.
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem
   heart has been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as
   needed.  Hct stable for now
   -  Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status: Patient is now very responsive and participatory,
   moves toes and arms well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows
   no evidence of stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   -  TPN today vs TF for today
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding
   - ENT will follow if needed
   - Appears resolved.
   # Hyperglycemia: No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on
   hydrocortisone w study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains
   hyperglycemic however over past several days.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of multiple medical conditions including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and diabetes. She was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain, which was found to be caused by significant blockages in her left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the affected arteries.

During the procedure, the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She was successfully resuscitated but required advanced cardiovascular support, including the use of a tandem heart device and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The tandem heart device was later removed due to a shunt, and the patient was transitioned off ECMO.

The patient's initial post-resuscitation course was complicated by hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension, for which she received atropine and vasopressor support. She also had episodes of acute respiratory distress, for which she was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's current condition is stable, with improved mental status and weaning off vasopressors. However, she remains dependent on the ventilator due to severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and acute congestive heart failure. The differential diagnosis also includes hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in the left main coronary artery (LM) and left anterior descending artery (LAD). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on the LAD and left circumflex artery. The patient developed ventricular tachycardia and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with medications. She was subsequently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and received a tandem heart, but this was partially retracted, causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated, and the tandem heart and ECMO were eventually removed. The patient's condition improved, and she was weaned off pressors. A tracheostomy was placed, and her mental status improved.

24-Hour Events:
- The patient's metolazone and lasix gtt were discontinued, and she received a single IV dose of lasix. She also received an initial dose of metoprolol.
- The patient pulled out her nasogastric (NG) tube and will have it re-placed early the next morning. Medications were held for the night, except for aspirin and clopidogrel, which were already administered.
- The patient's antibiotic regimen was changed to IV ciprofloxacin for the night, and metop"

   episode and chest pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD
   stenosis. POBA LAD and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab,
   intubated for respiratory distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support.
   Hypothermia protocal was initiated after patient presents self cooled
   and in coma. On [**1-2**] became bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT
   arrest. Received a tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to
   partially in the RA causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of
   ECMO and tandem heart. Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine.
   Improved mental status. Trach placed. To PCI soon.
   24 Hour Events:
   - ID recs: stop all antibiotics - observe patient closely - followed
   recs
   - NGT replaced
   - PS throughout day and most of night
   - attempted to get Passy Muir Valve - failed
   - PO diuretics - 80 PO lasix
   - gave PO mucomyst, NPO p MN for possible cath
   - afib with rvr to 160s - gave metoprolol tartrate 5mg IV x3 - to NRS
   - temperature to 100.3 - holding off tylenol - if spikes will culture,
   consider restarting abx

   Imaging: CXR: In comparison with the study of [**1-14**], there is an
   increase in the diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications, consistent
   with worsening pulmonary edema. The possibility of supervening
   pneumonia can certainly not be excluded, especially on this film
   degraded by respiratory motion.
   Retrocardiac opacification is consistent with substantial volume loss
   in the
   left lower lung and pleural effusion.

   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. To PCI soon
   #. Coronary Artery Disease: the patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic
   shock after PEA arrest.
   - PCI today or tomorrow
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue low dose beta blocker if pressures can tolerate
   - NPO p MN for possible cath
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.  Failed pressure
   support trial today due to tachypnea. Diuresed well yesterday and able
   to wean vent settings.
   - continue pressure support to condition lungs
   - PO diuresis today - 80mg lasix
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Infectious disease: Currently requiring phenylephrine. ID consulted.
   Discontinued antibiotics yesterday per ID recs. Will follow closely.
   - trend WBC, T
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - culture if spikes
   - consider restarting antibiotics if spikes
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent. Again had
   episode last PM. Was given IV lopressor and converted to sinus rhythm.
   [**Month (only) 8**] need to restart amiodarone if occurs in future.
   - cont telemetry
   - consider amiodarone
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved.
   Getting fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - restarted tube feeds
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.3, trending down
   from peak of 2. Still elevated from 1.0 on admission. Making good urine
   to PO lasix.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - cont PO lasix
   - mucomyst prior and post cath
   - pre and post cath hydration protocol
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem
   heart has been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as
   needed.  Hct stable for now.
   -  Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status: Patient is now very responsive and participatory,
   moves toes and arms well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows
   no evidence of stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   -  NPO for possible procedure - will resume TF when okay
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding has resolved
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia: No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was transferred from another hospital after experiencing syncope and chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in the left main and left anterior descending arteries. The patient had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left anterior descending artery and was also treated for ventricular tachycardia with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD).

Upon admission, the patient was in cardiogenic shock and required intubation, mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor support. The patient underwent therapeutic hypothermia and showed improved mental status.

The patient has had several complications since admission, including bradycardia, pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and recurrent atrial fibrillation. The patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to cardiac dysfunction but was later weaned off and now only requires phenylephrine for hemodynamic support.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema, infectious disease with an elevated white blood cell count, pancreatitis with elevated lipase levels, acute kidney injury with a rising creatinine level, anemia with a stable hematocrit, and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current plan of care includes coronary artery disease management with planned PCI, hypoxemic respiratory failure management with pressure support ventilation and diuresis,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. To PCI soon
   #. Coronary Artery Disease: the patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic
   shock after PEA arrest.  Received mucomyst x5 doses last night.
   - PCI today of LMCA
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - heparin gtt continued
   - continue low dose beta blocker if pressures can tolerate
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.  Failed pressure
   support trial today due to tachypnea.  Pressure support [**9-5**] yesterday,
   able to speak one word answers briefly yesterday w Passy-Muir Valve
   trial then tired out, rested on CMV overnight in preparation for Cath
   today.
   - rest today on CMV after PCI, but continue pressure support trials
   starting tomorrow to condition lungs
   - Hold AM lasix dose for today
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Infectious disease: Currently requiring phenylephrine. ID consulted.
   Meropenem restarted yesterday.  WBC stable.
   - trend WBC, Temp
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan
   - culture if spikes
   - consider Bronch by Thoracics/IP to get BAL and clean old blood out of
   lungs
   - AM cortisol for eval of hypotension and hypokalemia
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had
   another episode early AM. Was given IV lopressorx3 and converted to
   sinus rhythm.  Has gone in and out of Afib multiple times this AM,
   converting back to NSR on her own within a few minutes.
   - cont telemetry
   - increase beta blocker frequency to TID
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No
   longer needing fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Some mild
   abdominal tenderness this AM after restarting tube feeds yesterday.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - restarted tube feeds, has been NPO p MN for Cath
   #Acute Kidney injury: Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.2, trending down
   from peak of 2. Still elevated from 1.0 on admission. Making good urine
   to PO lasix.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - hold PO lasix today prior to Cath
   - mucomyst prior to Cath
   - pre and post cath hydration protocol
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem
   heart has been removed.  unclear etiology, but will transfuse as
   needed.  Hct stable for now.
   -  Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status: Patient is now very responsive and participatory,
   moves toes and arms well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows
   no evidence of stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   -  NPO for Cath today
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx bleeding has resolved
   - ENT will follow if needed
   # Hyperglycemia: No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on

","The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain, and subsequently underwent cardiac catheterization. The catheterization revealed 95% left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease and 99% left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed on the LAD and left circumflex arteries, but the patient experienced two episodes of ventricular tachycardia during the procedure and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 

The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and dopamine was initiated for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated due to self-cooling and altered mental status. The patient later experienced bradycardia and pulseless electrical activity (PEA), leading to another cardiac arrest. ECMO and tandem heart were placed but removed due to a shunt caused by the tandem heart in the right atrium. 

The patient has been diagnosed with coronary artery disease, specifically a STEMI and cardiogenic shock. PCI of the LMCA is planned. The patient also has hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also on the differential. 

The patient has been weaned off pressors and is currently only on phenylephrine. Pressure support trials have been unsuccessful due to tachypnea. Infectious"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant coronary artery disease, including 95% LMCA and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to LMCA and also experienced a ventricular tachyarrhythmia during the procedure. She was subsequently intubated and placed on ECMO due to cardiogenic shock and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The tandem heart was partially retracted, causing a shunt, and eventually removed. 

The patient's current medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema or acute congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, infectious disease, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, anemia, and hyperglycemia. The patient's neurological status has improved, with increased responsiveness and participation in activities. 

Plan:

1. Coronary Artery Disease: Continue PCI of LMCA, continue Plavix, aspirin, statin, heparin, and low-dose beta-blocker if pressures can tolerate.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: Rest on CMV after PCI, continue pressure support trials starting tomorrow to condition lungs, hold AM lasix dose for today, and remove trach stitches on [**1-19**].

   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had
   another episode early AM. Was given IV lopressorx3 and converted to
   sinus rhythm.  Has gone in and out of Afib multiple times this AM,
   converting back to NSR on her own within a few minutes.
   - cont telemetry
   - increase beta blocker frequency to TID
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No
   longer needing fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Some mild
   abdominal tenderness this AM after restarting tube feeds yesterday.
   - appreciate GI recs
   - restarted tube feeds, has been NPO p MN for Cath

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia during the procedure and was intubated for respiratory distress. Dopamine was initiated for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated due to self-cooling and coma. The patient then became bradycardic and experienced pulseless electrical activity arrest, receiving atropine and epinephrine. ECMO was initiated, followed by removal of ECMO and tandem heart. The patient is now on intra-aortic balloon pump support.

Medical Complications:

1. Coronary Artery Disease:
   - The patient has significant coronary artery disease, including 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis.
   - She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on 1/17/20XX.

2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure.
   - Other possible causes include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
   - Pressure support trials have been attempted, but the patient remains tachypneic.

3. Infectious Disease:
   - The patient requires phenyleph"

   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. To PCI soon
   #. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.   s/p PCI
   [**1-17**] of LMCA. On Intra-aortic balloon pump s/p PCI.
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - heparin gtt continued
   - wean IABP; place on 1:2 this AM and remove after Bronch
   - continue low dose beta blocker with pressor on for blood pressure
   support
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.  Pressure support 15/6 this morning after having received
   fluids in Cath.  Wedge pressure during Cath yesterday was elevated into
   30s -- pt needs diuresis.
   - restart lasix drip after bolus ; goal -2L for today
   - giving one dose acetazolamide in addition in setting of metabolic
   alkalosis
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis:
   pH trending upwards on blood gases overnight.  Need to be careful of
   further contraction alkalosis with diuresing further with lasix in the
   setting of metabolic alkalosis.   Consider RTA type 4 which could also
   account for possible potassium wasting.  AM cortisol  yesterday was
   within normal limits.
   - one dose acetazolamide
   #. Infectious disease:
   Currently requiring phenylephrine. ID has been following.  Patient
   appeared to respond well to meropenem but has received full course
   antibiotics.  Unclear what source of distributive shock is, may not be
   infectious.  AM cortisol within normal limits.  WBC stable.  Switched
   to ceftriaxone yesterday.   Temperatures in 99s over last 24 hours.

s creatinine is now at 1.1, trending down from peak of 2.
   Presented w Cr 1.0 on admission. Making good urine to PO lasix.
   Received mucomyst x5 doses prior to Cath.  Hypokalemia does not just
   appear to be associated with diuresis; consider potassium loss through
   kidneys.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, hypoxemic respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, infectious disease, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, anemia, and neurologic status. 

The patient presented with syncope episode and chest pain, and underwent cardiac catheterization that revealed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. She then underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent placement in the LMCA via left circumflex artery (LCx) and PTCA of proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). 

Following the PCI, the patient experienced cardiogenic shock and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, requiring resuscitation efforts including the placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The patient's condition improved, and the IABP and ECMO were eventually removed. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 280 mL tidal volume, with a respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 40%, and the positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is 6 cmH2O. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, troponin-T, CK"

   another episode early AM. Was given IV lopressorx3 and converted to
   sinus rhythm.  Has gone in and out of Afib multiple times this AM,
   converting back to NSR on her own within a few minutes.
   - cont telemetry
   - increase beta blocker frequency to TID
   #. Pancreatitis: Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No
   longer needing fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal
   ultrasound shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Some mild
   abdominal tenderness this AM after restarting tube feeds yesterday.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. She then experienced ventricular tachycardia and pulseless electrical activity arrest, requiring resuscitation efforts including intubation, dopamine for hemodynamic support, initiation of hypothermia protocol, and placement of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). She was also placed on ECMO and tandem heart due to severe cardiac dysfunction. The patient has since been weaned off pressors, tracheostomy placed, and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for LMCA.

Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient had a STEMI and cardiogenic shock, which necessitated PCI of the LMCA. She remains on IABP support and is being considered for weaning off it. She will continue with antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy, and heparin infusion.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure. Other potential causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are also being considered. The patient has failed pressure support trials due to tachypnea but will continue with pressure support trials starting tomorrow to condition her lungs.

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. To PCI soon
   #. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.   s/p PCI
   [**1-17**] of LMCA. On Intra-aortic balloon pump s/p PCI.
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - heparin gtt continued
   - wean IABP; place on 1:2 this AM and remove after Bronch
   - continue low dose beta blocker with pressor on for blood pressure
   support
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.  Pressure support 15/6 this morning after having received
   fluids in Cath.  Wedge pressure during Cath yesterday was elevated into
   30s -- pt needs diuresis.
   - restart lasix drip after bolus ; goal -2L for today
   - giving one dose acetazolamide in addition in setting of metabolic
   alkalosis
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis:
   pH trending upwards on blood gases overnight.  Need to be careful of
   further contraction alkalosis with diuresing further with lasix in the
   setting of metabolic alkalosis.   Consider RTA type 4 which could also
   account for possible potassium wasting.  AM cortisol  yesterday was
   within normal limits.
   - one dose acetazolamide
   #. Infectious disease:
   Currently requiring phenylephrine. ID has been following.  Patient
   appeared to respond well to meropenem but has received full course
   antibiotics.  Unclear what source of distributive shock is, may not be
   infectious.  AM cortisol within normal limits.  WBC stable.  Switched
   to ceftriaxone yesterday.   Temperatures in 99s over last 24 hours.
   - trend WBC, Temp
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan, low suspicion
   - culture if spikes
   - Bronch by Thoracics/IP to get BAL and clean old blood out of lungs
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had no further episodes over
   atrial fibrillation overnight.  Has been Amiodarone IV loaded in the
   past.
   - cont telemetry
   - continue low dose beta blocker
   #. Pancreatitis:
   Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No longer needing
   fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound
   shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Exam is benign.
   - restarted tube feeds last night; holding for bronchoscopy
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.1, trending down from peak of 2.
   Presented w Cr 1.0 on admission. Making good urine to PO lasix.
   Received mucomyst x5 doses prior to Cath.  Hypokalemia does not just
   appear to be associated with diuresis; consider potassium loss through
   kidneys.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - continue to monitor post Cath ; risk of contrast-induced nephropathy
   starting up to 48 hours later
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart, which
   appeared associated with anemia, has been removed.  unclear etiology,
   but will transfuse as needed.  Old blood suctioned out of trach tube
   persistently but not as much as before, no active bleed.  Hct stable
   for now.
   -          Cont to monitor
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   - restart tube feeds again slowly after Bronch today
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx
 no acute bleeding, has old clots
   - Thoracics to do Bronch
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.
   - ISS
    # Goals of care
 patient now back to full code.  Speech and swallow
   for passy-muir valve.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the LMCA and LAD. Following the procedure, she developed cardiogenic shock and experienced a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She was resuscitated and placed on intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient also had hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema due to acute congestive heart failure (CHF). She was intubated and received fluid resuscitation. The wedge pressure during the cardiac catheterization was elevated in the 30s, indicating the need for diuresis. Lasix was restarted, and acetazolamide was given to address metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of cardiac enzymes (CK, CK-MB, Troponin-T) and an elevated LDH level, which are indicative of myocardial injury. The WBC count was within normal limits, and the AM cortisol level was normal, ruling out an infectious cause for the distributive shock.

The patient had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, which were managed with Amiodarone IV. Pancreatitis was initially suspected due"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in her coronary arteries. She experienced a heart attack and cardiogenic shock but received treatment including intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She also had a tracheostomy placed. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Coronary artery disease: The patient had a STEMI and required PCI of LMCA. She is on Plavix, aspirin, and statin medications.
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient has pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure, possibly due to hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS, or other causes. She is on pressure support and diuretics.
- Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's pH is trending upwards, and she has metabolic alkalosis. She needs careful monitoring of potassium levels and may require acetazolamide.
- Infectious disease: The patient required phenylephrine and received meropenem antibiotics. Her ID is being followed, and cultures are pending.
- Atrial fibrillation: The patient has had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation and is on Amiodarone IV.
- Pancreatitis: The patient had elevated lipase levels but now appears resolved. She has had abdominal ultrasound, which showed no evidence of stones, and is holding tube"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. Now s/p PCI with stent to left main, jailed LAD with
   balloon espansion with good flow.
   #. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.   s/p PCI
   [**1-17**] of LMCA. On Intra-aortic balloon pump s/p PCI.
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue low dose beta blocker with pressor on for blood pressure
   support
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.
   - hold lasix today.
   - giving one dose acetazolamide in addition in setting of metabolic
   alkalosis
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis:
   pH trending upwards on blood gases overnight.  Need to be careful of
   further contraction alkalosis with diuresing further with lasix in the
   setting of metabolic alkalosis.   Consider RTA type 4 which could also
   account for possible potassium wasting.  AM cortisol  yesterday was
   within normal limits.
   - acetazolamide prn
   #. Fever: Patient appeared to respond well to meropenem but has
   received full course antibiotics.  Unclear what source of distributive
   shock is, may not be infectious.  AM cortisol within normal limits.
   WBC stable.  Spiked another temperature this AM.
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan, low suspicion
   - pan culture.
   - re-site central line.
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had no further episodes over
   atrial fibrillation overnight.  Has been Amiodarone IV loaded in the
   past.
   - cont telemetry
   - continue low dose beta blocker
   #. Pancreatitis:
   Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No longer needing
   fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound
   shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Exam is benign.
   - apparently resolved.
   #Acute Kidney injury:

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock after a pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement to the left main coronary artery and balloon expansion of the jailed left anterior descending artery.

The patient's current conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis, fever, atrial fibrillation, pancreatitis, acute kidney injury, anemia, and neurologic status improvement. 

She is on several medications, including Plavix, aspirin, statin, low-dose beta-blocker, and pressor support for blood pressure management. 

Her vital signs include a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/52 to 124/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100% on room air, and temperature within normal range.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,037 mL and output of 3,805 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,768 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. However, there are elevated levels of lactate, lipase, and liver enzymes.

The patient's neurological status has improved, and she is now very responsive and participatory.

   Assessment and Plan
   76F with [**Hospital 11306**] [**Hospital 1605**] transferred from OSH after syncope episode and chest
   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. Now s/p PCI with stent to left main, jailed LAD with
   balloon espansion with good flow.
   #. Coronary Artery Disease:
   Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest.   s/p PCI
   [**1-17**] of LMCA. On Intra-aortic balloon pump s/p PCI.
   - continue plavix
   - continue aspirin
   - continue statin
   - continue low dose beta blocker with pressor on for blood pressure
   support
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.
   - hold lasix today.
   - giving one dose acetazolamide in addition in setting of metabolic
   alkalosis
   - trach stitches can be removed [**1-19**]
   #. Metabolic Alkalosis:
   pH trending upwards on blood gases overnight.  Need to be careful of
   further contraction alkalosis with diuresing further with lasix in the
   setting of metabolic alkalosis.   Consider RTA type 4 which could also
   account for possible potassium wasting.  AM cortisol  yesterday was
   within normal limits.
   - acetazolamide prn
   #. Fever: Patient appeared to respond well to meropenem but has
   received full course antibiotics.  Unclear what source of distributive
   shock is, may not be infectious.  AM cortisol within normal limits.
   WBC stable.  Spiked another temperature this AM.
   - follow up cultures, beta glucan and galactomannan, low suspicion
   - pan culture.
   - re-site central line.
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had no further episodes over
   atrial fibrillation overnight.  Has been Amiodarone IV loaded in the
   past.
   - cont telemetry
   - continue low dose beta blocker
   #. Pancreatitis:
   Lipase was elevated although now appears resolved. No longer needing
   fentanyl boluses for pain control. TG normal. Abdominal ultrasound
   shows no evidence of stones. GI consulted.  Exam is benign.
   - apparently resolved.
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.3 trending down from peak of 2.
   Presented w Cr 1.0 on admission. Making good urine to PO lasix.
   Received mucomyst x5 doses prior to Cath.  Hypokalemia does not just
   appear to be associated with diuresis; consider potassium loss through
   kidneys.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - continue to monitor post Cath ; risk of contrast-induced nephropathy
   starting up to 48 hours later
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed. Tandem heart, which
   appeared associated with anemia, has been removed.  unclear etiology,
   but will transfuse as needed.  Old blood suctioned out of trach tube
   persistently but not as much as before, no active bleed.  Hct stable
   for now.  Guiaic positive today.
   -          transfuse as needed.
   -          Pm hematocrit.
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   - continue tube feeds.
   #Epistaxis, oropharynx
 no acute bleeding, has old clots
   - bronch clear of blood.
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w
   study protocol.  Study drug now stopped.  Remains hyperglycemic however
   over past several days.

   I have reviewed the progress note history and physical examination on
   [**2142-1-20**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 9313**] noted above.  I was present during the
   pertinent portions of the physical examination today.   I concur with
   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 76 year old woman presented to [**Hospital 7788**] with a left main occlusion that was emergently treated
   with balloon angioplasty.  She was transferred to the [**Hospital1 5**] for
   surgical revascularization but stabilized and due to a poor mental
   status, was deemed an inoperative candidate.  The left main was then
   stented using Tandem Heart support.  Her course has been prolonged with
   a trach placement, blood loss, and now with fevers of uncertain
   origin.  Her Tmax over the past 24 hours was > 101 without obvious
   source.  We would now like to proceed with PEG placement to remove the
   NG tube, which is a potential source for her sinus infection.   Her
   heparinization for atrial fibrillation has been stopped due to a fall
   in her HCT and requirement for 2 U PRBC transfusion.   The source of
   the blood loss is not clear.
   ASSESSMENT:  Left main coronary artery disease s/p stenting placement
   with Tandem Heart support
                                Monitor HCTs for continued blood loss
   continue aspirin and plavix
   PLAN:                     Proceed with ventilatory support and PEG tube
   placement

","Based on the provided information, the patient's medical history and progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and cardiogenic shock after PEA arrest. She underwent PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) with stent placement to the left main coronary artery. She will need to continue on antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel) and statins.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes include hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome). Management includes administration of IV Lasix and close monitoring of I/Os (input/output).

3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever despite receiving full courses of antibiotics. Cultures have been negative except for pan-sensitive Klebsiella sputum, which was thought to be colonization. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of infection, and a CT scan has shown no evidence of infection.

4. Anemia: The patient has anemia, possibly related to the tandem heart procedure. A transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells was given yesterday with Lasix in between. Bronchial lavage was also performed.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation. She is currently on"

   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential.
   - one time IV dose lasix this morning and monitor I/Os
   - trach stitches can be removed now
   #. Fever:
   Patient appeared to respond well to meropenem but has received full
   course antibiotics and is now not receiving any Abx.  Unclear what
   source of distributive shock is, may not be infectious.  AM cortisol
   within normal limits.  WBC stable.  Spiked another temperature this
   AM.  Pan-CT scan with no other source of infection.  C diff negative
   again yesterday.  Cultures negative except for pan-sensitive Klebsiella
   sputum which was thoguht to be colonization.  Central line resited
   yesterday. No concern on CT for pseudocyst or abscess in setting of
   recent pancreatitis.  beta glucan and galactomannan negative.
   - f/u final CT read
   - resend C diff today
   - pan culture when spikes again
   #. Anemia:
   CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had guaiac +
   stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia, has been
   removed.  Transfused 2 units of pRBCs yesterday w lasix in between.
   Bronch clean.
   -          Pm hematocrit
   - hold heparin gtt
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had no further episodes over
   atrial fibrillation overnight.  Has been Amiodarone IV loaded in the
   past.
   - cont telemetry
   - continue low dose beta blocker
   - holding heparin drip in setting of hct drop
   #Acute Kidney injury:
   Patient
s creatinine is now at 1.0 trending down from peak of 2.
   Presented w Cr 1.0 on admission. Making good urine to PO or IV lasix.
   Received mucomyst x5 doses prior to Cath.
   - replete lytes PRN
   - continue to monitor post Cath ; risk of contrast-induced nephropathy
   risk up to 48 hours later
   #. Neurologic status:
   Patient is now very responsive and participatory, moves toes and arms
   well, turns head and tries to speak.  CT head shows no evidence of
   stroke.
   - will continue to follow her clinical exam.
   # Nutrition:
   - continue tube feeds.
   - family discussion regarding placing PEG tube temporarily to help with
   LTAC placement and preventing sinus injury/infection
   # Hyperglycemia:
   No h/o DM, presented hyperglycemic.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been on hydrocortisone w

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease, hypoxemic respiratory failure, fever, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and neurologic status. She presented with syncope episode and chest pain, and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement to the left main coronary artery and balloon expansion of the jailed LAD with good flow.

The patient experienced cardiogenic shock after a pause in ventricular tachycardia arrest, received ECMO and tandem heart support, and was weaned off pressors. She also underwent PCI with stent placement to the LMCA and has been on low-dose beta-blocker therapy.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.5°F, blood pressure of 89/44 mmHg, heart rate of 111 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 280 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 6 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 20800/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, elevated troponin-T, and slightly elevated liver enzymes. Her electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging studies reveal unchanged moderate paranasal sinus disease with bilateral partial ostiomeatal unit occlusion, a small linear hyperdensity along the left parietal lobe that may represent a small subacute infarct, and no evidence of infection on CT scan.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of significant coronary artery disease with 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. There is a risk of recurrent ischemic events or complications related to the stent placement.

2. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with persistent hypoxemia despite mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of further deterioration in oxygenation and the need for continued ventilatory support.

3. Fever: The patient has had recurrent fevers despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and no apparent source of infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the fever and prevent potential infections.

4. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels have been fluctuating, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate red blood cell production. Monitoring and management of the patient's anemia are crucial to optimize tissue perfusion.

5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has experienced intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent thromboembolic events"

   pain, cardiac cath showed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. POBA LAD
   and LCx with VT s/p shock twice in cath lab, intubated for respiratory
   distress, dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocal was
   initiated after patient presents self cooled and in coma. On [**1-2**] became
   bradycardic, atropine was given, PEA to VT arrest. Received a
   tandemheart in cath lab, however retracted to partially in the RA
   causing a shunt. ECMO was initiated. Removal of ECMO and tandem heart.
   Weaned pressors now only on phenylephrine. Improved mental status.
   Trach placed. Now s/p PCI with stent to left main, jailed LAD with
   balloon espansion with good flow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization and was found to have significant blockages in her coronary arteries. She experienced cardiogenic shock and underwent resuscitation measures including intubation, administration of pressors, and placement on ECMO.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, fever, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, anemia, and neurologic status improvement. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should also be considered.

2. Fever: Despite receiving a full course of antibiotics, the patient continues to have a fever. Possible sources of infection include central line-associated bloodstream infection, pneumonia, or colonization with Klebsiella. Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation. It is important to continue monitoring her on telemetry and consider continuing low-dose beta-blockers to prevent further episodes.

4. Acute kidney injury: The patient's creatinine level has increased from 1.0 to 2.0, indicating acute kidney injury. This could be due to contrast-induced"

","The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization which showed significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and balloon expansion in the jailed left anterior descending artery.

The patient's condition deteriorated, leading to cardiogenic shock, pulseless electrical activity (PEA), and subsequent resuscitation efforts including the use of a tandemheart and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The tandemheart was partially inserted in the right atrium, causing a shunt, and was eventually removed. ECMO was initiated and later removed as well.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (100.9°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 97/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is still on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hb), and lactate levels, along with elevated troponin-T and CK-MB indicating myocardial injury. The patient's creatinine level has improved from a peak of 2.0 to 1.0.

The patient has multiple medical complications including coronary artery disease, hypox"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain. The cardiac catheterization revealed significant blockages in the left main coronary artery (95%) and the left anterior descending artery (99%). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery and balloon expansion of the jailed LAD with good flow.

The patient's condition has been complex and dynamic. Initially, she required intubation for respiratory distress and was on dopamine for hemodynamic support. She also underwent hypothermia protocol and experienced a bradycardic episode treated with atropine. The patient had two ventricular tachyarrhythmias during the cardiac catheterization and received a tandemheart in the cath lab but was later retracted due to a shunt. ECMO was initiated, and the tandemheart and ECMO were eventually removed. The patient has been weaned off pressors and is now on phenylephrine only. Her mental status has improved, and a tracheostomy tube was placed.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including coronary artery disease (s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock), hypoxemic respiratory failure (likely secondary to pulmonary edema or ARDS), fever (with negative cultures except for pan-sensitive Klebsiella sputum), anemia (with transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant blockages in her coronary arteries. The patient then received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting to improve blood flow. However, she experienced cardiogenic shock and required ECMO support. After removal of the tandem heart device, the patient's condition improved, and she was weaned off pressors.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has a history of STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) and cardiogenic shock. She underwent PCI with stenting to address the blockages in her coronary arteries. It is important to continue anticoagulation therapy and monitor her cardiac function.
2. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient likely has pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other possible causes, such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), should also be considered. Monitoring I/O (input/output) balance and ensuring negative fluid balance is crucial. Tracheostomy stitches can be removed now.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever despite receiving full courses of antibiotics. It is important to identify the source of the fever, as it may not be infectious. Pan-CT scan, cultures, and C. difficile testing should be performed. The central line should be reviewed"

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a syncope episode and chest pain. The cardiac catheterization showed significant blockages in the left main coronary artery (95%) and the left anterior descending artery (99%). The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery and balloon expansion of the jailed LAD with good flow.

The patient has had several medical complications since admission, including hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypotension requiring intermittent pressors, fever, coronary artery disease, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, neurologic status improvement, hyperglycemia, insomnia, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 103 bpm, blood pressure 93/59 mmHg, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 100% on ventilator.
- Physical examination: Anxious, elderly, tracheostomy tube in place, bilateral crackles in the lungs, edema in both lower extremities, attentive and follows simple commands.
- Labs: Hemoglobin 9.5 g/dL, leukocyte count 8.4 K/uL, platelet count 207 K/uL, creatinine 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose 151 mg/dL, troponin-T 19.34 ng/mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cardiac issues, including syncope, chest pain, and coronary artery disease. She underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement to the left main artery. The patient also experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the procedure and required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). She was intubated due to respiratory distress and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. Hypothermia protocol was initiated, and the patient was placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to a shunt caused by a partially inserted tandemheart in the right atrium. The tandemheart and ECMO were eventually removed, and the patient's condition improved. She is now extubated and receiving phenylephrine for blood pressure support. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 93/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and sinus tachycardia on ECG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient may experience difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygen levels in the blood, which can be secondary to pulmonary edema, acute congestive heart failure, hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
   - Monitor I/O and continue to diurese with lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance.
   - Continue with tracheostomy tube management.

2. Hypotension: The patient requires intermittent pressors, specifically phenylephrine, to maintain adequate blood pressure. The goal is to minimize the use of pressors.
   - Administer phenylephrine as needed while monitoring for any adverse effects.

3. Fever: The patient has had multiple episodes of fever, and the source of infection is unclear. The patient has completed a full course of antibiotics and is currently not receiving any further antimicrobial therapy.
   - Follow up on the cultures and consider restarting antibiotics if there is evidence of a new infection.
   - Continue monitoring the patient's temperature and assess for any potential sources of infection.

4. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a history of STEMI and cardiogenic shock after a PEA arrest. She underwent PCI of the left main coronary artery.
   - Continue with antiplatelet therapy using Plavix, aspirin, and a statin.
   - Restart heparin gtt for apical akinesis and monitor hematocrit levels.

5. Anemia: The patient has anemia, and there is no evidence of intraabdominal bleed. The tandemheart, associated with anemia, has been removed.
   - Monitor hematocrit levels and consider transfusion of packed red blood cells if necessary.
   - Restart heparin gtt as previously ordered.

6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has experienced recurrent and intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation.
   - Continue low-dose beta-blocker therapy.
   - Monitor for any further episodes of atrial fibrillation.

7. Acute kidney injury: The patient's serum creatinine has increased from 1.0 to 2.0, indicating acute kidney injury.
   - Replete electrolytes as needed.
   - Monitor renal function closely.

8. Neurologic status: The patient's neurologic status has improved significantly, and she is now responsive and participatory.
   - Continue to follow the patient's clinical exam and monitor for any changes in neurologic status.

9. Nutrition: The patient's nutritional needs should be addressed, and tube feeds should be restarted.
   - Plan for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement on Wednesday.

10. Hyperglycemia: The patient presented with hyperglycemia, and her glucose levels need to be monitored and managed.
    - Adjust insulin sliding scale as needed to maintain glycemic control.

11. Insomnia: The patient experienced difficulty sleeping, but she slept well last night.
    - Consider using ambien for sleep initiation.

Overall, the patient's main concerns include respiratory failure, hypotension, fever, coronary artery disease, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, neurologic status, nutrition, hyperglycemia, and insomnia. The patient's care plan involves monitoring vital signs, managing fluid balance, administering appropriate medications, and providing supportive care as needed."

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of cardiac issues, including syncope episodes and chest pain. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which revealed 95% LM disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient experienced ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the procedure, leading to cardiogenic shock. She was intubated and received dopamine for hemodynamic support. The patient's condition improved with the initiation of a hypothermia protocol, and she was later weaned off the pressors. Tracheostomy placement was performed, and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main artery, although the LAD was jailed and required balloon expansion for good flow.

The patient's current medical complications include:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: The patient is likely experiencing pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. Other potential causes such as hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) should be considered. The goal is to maintain negative fluid balance, continue diuresis with lasix, and monitor I/O.
2. Hypotension: The patient requires intermittent pressors, particularly phenylephrine, to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (MAP) during sleep. Pressor support is not required while the patient is awake.
3. Fever: Despite receiving full courses of antibiotics, the patient continues to have intermittent fevers"

   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring
   and support devices are unchanged, except for the nasogastric tube that
   has been removed in the interval and the removal of the left-sided
   central venous access line.
   The lung volumes are slightly decreased. There is increased evidence of
   bilateral basal opacities and increase in extent of the retrocardiac
   opacity.  The potentially pre-existing small bilateral pleural
   effusions have also increased in extent. The increase in overall
   pulmonary density is likely to
   be caused by a combination of pulmonary edema and infection.
   There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The overall size of the cardiac
   silhouette is unchanged.

   Addendum to above note: since note was written. Patient became
   hypotensive requiring increased pressor requirements. She had a PEA
   arrest with around 5 minutes of CPR. The patient again required
   increased pressor requirement. The etiology was unclear. Please see
   arrest note for further details. The patient was made DNR after a
   discussion with the family. The above note was written at 8AM for
   morning rounds.

","The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, who presented with syncope and chest pain. She underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed 95% LMCA disease and 99% LAD stenosis. The patient had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main artery and balloon expansion in the jailed LAD with good flow.

The patient's current condition is complicated by hypotension requiring pressors, hypoxemic respiratory failure, fever, anemia, atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury, and neurologic status improvement. She has multiple comorbidities including coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and depression. The patient's recent hospital course includes a ventricular tachyarrhythmia with shock, cardiac arrest, ECMO placement, tandem heart placement, and removal.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, blood pressure of 116/73 mmHg (88/47 mmHg during sleep), heart rate of 95 bpm (78-107 bpm), respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute (19-33 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation of 95% on ventilator, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 12 (Eyes Opened to Verbal command, Confused, Inappropriate, Not assessed).

   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring

   has been removed in the interval and the removal of the left-sided
   central venous access line.
   The lung volumes are slightly decreased. There is increased evidence of
   bilateral basal opacities and increase in extent of the retrocardiac
   opacity.  The potentially pre-existing small bilateral pleural
   effusions have also increased in extent. The increase in overall
   pulmonary density is likely to
   be caused by a combination of pulmonary edema and infection.
   There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The overall size of the cardiac
   silhouette is unchanged.

   Imaging: CXR: As compared to the previous examination, the monitoring

   has been removed in the interval and the removal of the left-sided
   central venous access line.
   The lung volumes are slightly decreased. There is increased evidence of
   bilateral basal opacities and increase in extent of the retrocardiac
   opacity.  The potentially pre-existing small bilateral pleural
   effusions have also increased in extent. The increase in overall
   pulmonary density is likely to
   be caused by a combination of pulmonary edema and infection.
   There is no evidence of pneumothorax. The overall size of the cardiac
   silhouette is unchanged.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope and chest pain. The cardiac catheterization revealed significant stenosis in the left main coronary artery and left anterior descending artery. The patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main artery and balloon expansion in the LAD.

Since admission, the patient has had multiple medical complications. She developed hypotension requiring pressor support and has been partially weaned off phenylephrine. She also experienced hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. The patient's fever was initially responsive to meropenem but has since recurred despite receiving a full course of antibiotics. Cultures are pending.

The patient's coronary artery disease was managed with PCI and stent placement. She also has anemia, which may be related to the tandem heart procedure that was partially retracted. The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and is currently being treated with amiodarone. Acute kidney injury has developed, with a rising creatinine level from 1.1 to 1.8. Neurologic status has improved, and there is no evidence of stroke on CT head.

The patient's blood cultures have grown pan-sensitive Klebsiella, but it is unclear if this represents colonization or infection. Other potential sources of infection have been ruled out, including central line-associated"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, including 95% LMCA and 99% LAD stenosis. She presented with syncope and chest pain and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty and stenting of the LMCA. Post-procedure, she experienced cardiogenic shock requiring intubation, mechanical circulatory support (ECMO), and vasopressor support. She also had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received epinephrine and atropine. Currently, she is on multiple pressors and has been weaned off some of them. She has metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate levels, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, and hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient is also anemic, had atrial fibrillation, and has unclear neurologic status after the last PEA arrest. She has been placed on DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, which may have contributed to the development of distributive shock as well. She requires ongoing pressor support.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has elevated lactate levels, indicating poor tissue perfusion. She has received bicarbonate pushes and is on a bicarbonate drip.
3. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels have"

   24 Hour Events:
   - LFT elevated, may be secondary to hypotension the prior day, will
   trend
   - thoracic surgery signed off, wont do PEG until off pressors
   - increased midodrine, lowered beta blocker to [**Hospital1 **]
   - repeat Cr still elevated, I/O even to slightly out
   - lactate normal
   - no positive cultures as of yet
   - CODE BLUE at just before 6pm.  Patient was less responsive and while
   attempting to obtain an ABG, patient became progressively bradycardic,
   hypotensive, unresponsive, and then lost pulses.  Chest compressions
   were performed with less than 1 min of PEA.  Patient's pulse returned
   after 3 minutes and 1mg of epinephrine.  Patient's femoral pulses
   remained thready for approx 5min and then pulses were lost again.
   Patient received less than 2 minutes of chest compressions and 1mg of
   atropine before femoral pulses returned.  In addition to increasing the
   neoepinephrine, which the patient was on prior to the code, patient was
   placed on epinephrine and dopamine drips.  TTE demonstrated mod/severe
   MR, mod/sever TR, but decent LV function.  No ASD jet visualized.  A
   left femoral A-line was placed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in sterile fashion.
   Initial code ABG demonstrated a pH of 6.95 and the patient was given 2
   amps of bicarb and started on a bicard drip.  given meropenem and
   vancomycin for concern for septic contribution.  Respiratory concerned
   about auto-peeping.  They performed a bronchoscope, but did not find
   cause for obstruction, some laryngomalacia noted.  Because the patient
   was fighting the vent, she was given fentanyl and midazolam for
   sedation and her flow volumes regularized.  Pt given another amp
   bicarbonate w goal pH 7.2.  Potassium levels declined as pH improved
   with bicarbonate administration.  K levels were sent with repeat ABGs
   as the patient had been given kayexalate prior to code when only the K
   of 5.5 was available from a Chem7 in the setting of elevated Cr.
   Complete Chem7 results returned after the code and revealed a large
   anion gap acidosis from the labs drawn at 3:38pm.
   - Lasix bolus 80mg IV and lasix drip with goal of even from here out.
   - Family meetings with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3590**].  Patient made DNR, but goal to

She has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent PCI to the left main coronary artery (LMCA) with stenting of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The patient had two previous episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, for which she received resuscitation and pressor support. She also underwent tracheostomy placement. 

The patient's current condition is critical, requiring mechanical ventilation and multiple pressors for hemodynamic support. She has metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, elevated liver enzymes, and respiratory failure. The patient's cardiac function is compromised, as indicated by moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and a depressed left ventricular systolic function. There is also a mobile echodensity in the right ventricular outflow tract, which could represent a thrombus or vegetation. 

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a history of myocardial infarction. She has ongoing infections, including positive blood cultures, and requires further evaluation and management of her conditions. The patient's family has been involved in discussions regarding her care, and she has been designated as do not resuscitate (DNR)."

   s/p PCI with BMS to LMCA with jailed LAD, now s/p PEA arrest.
   #. Shock: unclear etiology. Possibly secondary to ventilator mechanics,
   pulmonary event or other. Also has component of cardiogenic shock which
   has remained stable. Currently requiring pressors.  Unlikely to be
   cardiogenic shock as there is no evidence of new MI and no change in
   wall motion abnormalities on echo.  Patient is not clamped down on
   exam.  More concerning currently is a potential infectious/septic
   etiology as patient has elevating white count, bandemia (although could
   be explained by recent PEA arrest).  The patient is also newly tender
   in the abdomen, which suggests an abdominal source.  Ischemic bowel is
   also on the differential given new [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive stools
   and previous lactate, although these have all resolved.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with a STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement in the left main coronary artery. The patient experienced multiple episodes of hypotension and required pressor support. She also had a PEA arrest, which was successfully resuscitated. The patient developed acute respiratory distress and required intubation. She was placed on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and underwent tracheostomy placement. The patient's condition has been complicated by acute kidney injury, transaminitis, hypoxemic respiratory failure, and anemia. The patient has had recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and has been sedated and mechanically ventilated. The family has made the decision to honor the patient's wishes for a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) status and to avoid further invasive therapies, such as dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient has experienced episodes of hypotension and requires pressor support. The etiology of the shock is unclear but may be secondary to ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event, or other causes.
2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had an elevated lactate level during a code, which is now trending down. The cause of the metabolic acidosis is unclear and may be related to the inability to alter ventilatory mechanics.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope, cardiac catheterization, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to the left main coronary artery (LMCA), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She has a history of coronary artery disease, including a recent ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and cardiogenic shock.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation
- Shock, possibly secondary to ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event, or other causes
- Cardiogenic shock which has remained stable
- Abdominal distension and tenderness without evidence of air-fluid levels on KUB
- Metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate, now resolved
- Acute kidney injury with progressively rising creatinine and low urine output
- Transaminitis likely secondary to shock liver
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure likely secondary to pulmonary edema

The patient has undergone several interventions, including tracheostomy, PCI with bare-metal stent (BMS) to LMCA with jailed LAD, tandem heart, ECMO, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She is currently on multiple medications, including heparin, midodrine, lasix, metolazone, plavix, aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, amiodarone, and citalopram.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Shock: The patient is experiencing shock, possibly secondary to ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event, or other causes. It is unclear whether the shock is primarily cardiogenic or septic in origin.
2. Infection/Sepsis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count and bandemia, which suggests a possible infection or sepsis. This could be due to a pulmonary source or an abdominal source.
3. Ischemic Bowel: The patient's new tenderness in the abdomen and positive guaiac stools raise suspicion for ischemic bowel, particularly given her history of recent PEA arrest.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient's recent antibiotic use and gastrointestinal symptoms may increase the risk of developing C. diff infection.
5. Mesenteric ischemia: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distension, tenderness, and positive guaiac stools, suggest the possibility of mesenteric ischemia.
6. Pancreatic abscess: The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, elevated white blood cell count, and positive guaiac stools, raise suspicion for a pancreatic abscess.
7. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's progressively rising creatinine and low urine output indicate acute kidney injury, likely secondary to hypoperfusion.
8. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's initial metabolic acidosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope, chest pain, and cardiac catheterization showing 95% LMCA and 99% LAD stenosis. She underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement to the LMCA with jailed LAD. The patient also had a tandem heart procedure and ECMO support. She was intubated for respiratory distress and required pressors for hemodynamic support. She has a history of PEA arrest twice, tracheostomy placement, and PCI with BMS to LMCA with jailed LAD. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube, receiving sedation, and has a Foley catheter in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient likely has mixed etiology hypotension/shock with possible contributions from ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event, or other factors. There is also a component of cardiogenic shock which has remained stable. The patient was weaned off pressors this morning but remains on midodrine. The elevated white blood cell count suggests a potential infectious/septic etiology, possibly with an abdominal source. Ischemic bowel is also on the differential given her abdominal pain, guaiac positive stools, and previous lactate levels.

2. Abdominal Distension/Tenderness: The patient has ongoing abdominal distension and tenderness, with continuous"

   #. Hypotension/Shock:
   Likely mixed etiology, multifactorial.  Possible contribution from
   ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event or other.  Has component of
   cardiogenic shock which has remained stable.  Weaned off pressors this
   morning, so appears to be hemodynamically stable; still on midodrine.
   Patient is not clamped down on exam.  More concerning currently is a
   potential infectious/septic etiology as patient has elevating white
   count.  Continues to be tender in the abdomen, which suggests an
   abdominal source.  Ischemic bowel is also on the differential given
   [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive stools and previous lactate, although
   lactate has resolved.  Patient w elevated WBC, possibly abdominal
   process
C Diff, mesenteric ischemia, pancreatic abscess/psuedocyst--
   despite decreased pressor requirement.  C diff has been negative so far
   on multiple occasions. No need to float Swan at this time b/c improving
   hemodynamically
   - repeat CBC to make sure elevated WBC was real; check diff and trend
   WBC and fever curve
   - cont midodrine
   - f/u culture data
   - trend lactate, pH
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to look for infection source
   - Repeat C diff
   # Leukocytosis:
   Worsening leukocytosis, possibly abdominal source w distension on exam
   and tenderness.  Known sinusitis, though not likely that severe.
   Continues to spike fevers though not high fevers, not likely to have
   abscess.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had Vanc in system for last couple of days after
   stopping antibiotics in setting of decreased renal clearance.
   -          repeat Pan CT scan
 chest/abd/pelvis w po contrast only
   -          trend WBC, fever curve
   -          Vanc level
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] restart antibiotics if WBC elevates further or if pt
   becomes more hemodynamically unstable or starts to spike higher fevers
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen/pelvis
   -          Add lipase
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved
   completely yesterday.  Increasing gap again with rising lactate.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be
   recurring.  PEA arrest likely secondary to added insult associated w
   ventilatory mechanics on top of another unclear process.
   - trend ABG, trend lactate
   - continue pressor support as needed
   - CT abdomen to look for mesenteric ischemia
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still very low, did not respond well to lasix gtt plus metolazone,
   though appears to have slightly increased UOP this AM.  Electrolytes
   still stable but may soon require dialysis in 24-48 hours.  Family
   prefers no dialysis.  Patient is 6-7L positive in last few days with
   decreased urine output.
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - family meeting regarding CVVH again
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential still, though p/f ratio not low.  Increased O2 requirement
   yesterday in setting of increased fluid intake and worsening renal
   failure.
   - I/O per above
   - cont lasix and metolazone trial
   - trach stitches should be removed
 contact [**Name (NI) **]
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now per Ultrasound. Improving
   transaminitis.  INR improved w 2 doses of vitamin K.
   - trend liver enzymes.
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  No recent
   episodes.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.
    # Nutrition:
   - switch to double calorie/renal/hepatic formulation.
   # Hyperglycemia: D5W overnight so elevated. Continue ISS.
   - ISS - adjust prn
   # Insomnia/ Depression:   Ambien works well intermittently.  Patient
   needs rest to help w anxiety
   - continue ambien
   - continue citalopram
   # Goals of care

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU after experiencing syncope, cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease, and subsequent cardiac arrest. She underwent resuscitation efforts including intubation, ECMO, and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery (LMCA). The patient had multiple episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and her condition has been complicated by hypotension/shock, leukocytosis with abdominal tenderness, metabolic acidosis, acute kidney injury, hypoxemic respiratory failure, transaminitis, coronary artery disease, anemia, atrial fibrillation, and neurologic status concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has had mixed etiology shock, likely due to a combination of factors including ventilator mechanics, pulmonary events, and cardiogenic shock. It is important to monitor the patient's hemodynamic stability and consider potential infectious or septic etiologies, especially with the presence of an elevated white blood cell count and abdominal tenderness.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, suggesting a possible abdominal source of infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause, and appropriate antibiotics should be restarted if the patient becomes more hemodynamically unstable or spikes higher fevers.

3. Abdominal Distension/Tenderness:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaint and 24-hour events indicate a lack of response to diuretic therapy, resulting in minimal urine output overnight. The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type I, metabolic acidosis, and myocardial infarction.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), blood pressure ranging from 90/46 mmHg to 133/71 mmHg, heart rate between 70-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 15-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 280 mL, respiratory rate set at 20, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 6 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and liver enzymes. The blood glucose levels are fluctuating within the range of 111-207 mg/dL. Other lab values indicate elevated D-dimer, lactic acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and low albumin and magnesium levels.

The patient's medical conditions include acute renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss,"

   Assessment and Plan
   76F transferred from OSH after syncope, CP, cardiac cath 95% LMCA, 99%
   LAD stenosis, s/p POBA of LAD and LCx c/b VT s/p shock x2 in cath lab,
   intubated for respiratory distress, requiring pressors for hemodynamic
   support, s/p tandemheart, ECMO, s/p PEA arrest x2, s/p trach placement,
   s/p PCI with BMS to LMCA with jailed LAD, now s/p PEA arrest.
   #. Shock: unclear etiology. Possibly secondary to ventilator mechanics,
   pulmonary event or other. Also has component of cardiogenic shock which
   has remained stable. Currently requiring pressors.  Unlikely to be
   cardiogenic shock as there is no evidence of new MI and no change in
   wall motion abnormalities on echo.  Patient is not clamped down on
   exam.  More concerning currently is a potential infectious/septic
   etiology as patient has elevating white count, bandemia (although could
   be explained by recent PEA arrest).  The patient is also newly tender
   in the abdomen, which suggests an abdominal source.  Ischemic bowel is
   also on the differential given new [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive stools
   and previous lactate, although lactate has resolved.  Patient w
   elevated WBC, possibly abdominal process
C Diff, mesenteric ischemia,
   pancreatic abscess-- despite decreased pressor requirement.
   - cont levophed, midodrine
   - trend lactate, pH
   - trend WBC, T
   - family meeting
   - follow cultures
   - will consider CT abdomen today to look for infection source
   - consider swan-ganz catheter via fem line to evaluate abdomen and
   cardiac output
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen if patient continues to spike fevers, or
   displaying further signs of distributive shock.
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be secondary
   to inability to alter ventilatory mechanics.
   - trend ABG
   - trend lactate
   - continue pressor support
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still 5-15cc/hr, did not respond to lasix gtt plus metolazone.
   Electrolytes still stable but may soon require dialysis in 24-48
   hours.  Family prefers no dialysis.
   - pressor support
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now.
   - vitamin K for INR 5mg for 1 more day
   - trend liver enzymes.
   - consider hepatology consult if not improved
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure: Likely secondary to pulmonary edema
   secondary to acute congestive heart failure, although hemorrhage,
   aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on differential.
   - I/O per above
   - lasix and metolazone
   - trach stitches can be removed - will be done by CT Surgery at time of
   PEG placement
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  Had
   another episode of atrial fibrillation overnight.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.

   s/p PCI with BMS to LMCA with jailed LAD, now s/p PEA arrest.
   #. Hypotension/Shock:
   Likely mixed etiology, multifactorial.  Possible contribution from
   ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event or other.  Has component of
   cardiogenic shock which has remained stable.  Weaned off pressors this
   morning, so appears to be hemodynamically stable; still on midodrine.
   Patient is not clamped down on exam.  More concerning currently is a
   potential infectious/septic etiology as patient has elevating white
   count.  Continues to be tender in the abdomen, which suggests an
   abdominal source.  Ischemic bowel is also on the differential given
   [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive stools and previous lactate, although
   lactate has resolved.  Patient w elevated WBC, possibly abdominal
   process
C Diff, mesenteric ischemia, pancreatic abscess/psuedocyst--
   despite decreased pressor requirement.  C diff has been negative so far
   on multiple occasions. No need to float Swan at this time b/c improving
   hemodynamically
   - repeat CBC to make sure elevated WBC was real; check diff and trend
   WBC and fever curve
   - cont midodrine
   - f/u culture data
   - trend lactate, pH
   - CT abdomen/pelvis today to look for infection source
   - Repeat C diff
   # Leukocytosis:
   Worsening leukocytosis, possibly abdominal source w distension on exam
   and tenderness.  Known sinusitis, though not likely that severe.
   Continues to spike fevers though not high fevers, not likely to have
   abscess.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had Vanc in system for last couple of days after
   stopping antibiotics in setting of decreased renal clearance.
   -          repeat Pan CT scan
 chest/abd/pelvis w po contrast only
   -          trend WBC, fever curve
   -          Vanc level
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] restart antibiotics if WBC elevates further or if pt
   becomes more hemodynamically unstable or starts to spike higher fevers
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen/pelvis
   -          Add lipase
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved
   completely yesterday.  Increasing gap again with rising lactate.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be
   recurring.  PEA arrest likely secondary to added insult associated w
   ventilatory mechanics on top of another unclear process.
   - trend ABG, trend lactate
   - continue pressor support as needed
   - CT abdomen to look for mesenteric ischemia
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still very low, did not respond well to lasix gtt plus metolazone,
   though appears to have slightly increased UOP this AM.  Electrolytes
   still stable but may soon require dialysis in 24-48 hours.  Family
   prefers no dialysis.  Patient is 6-7L positive in last few days with
   decreased urine output.
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   - family meeting regarding CVVH again
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential still, though p/f ratio not low.  Increased O2 requirement
   yesterday in setting of increased fluid intake and worsening renal
   failure.
   - I/O per above
   - cont lasix and metolazone trial
   - trach stitches should be removed
 contact [**Name (NI) **]
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now per Ultrasound. Improving
   transaminitis.  INR improved w 2 doses of vitamin K.
   - trend liver enzymes.
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  No recent
   episodes.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.
    # Nutrition:
   - switch to double calorie/renal/hepatic formulation.
   # Hyperglycemia: D5W overnight so elevated. Continue ISS.
   - ISS - adjust prn
   # Insomnia/ Depression:   Ambien works well intermittently.  Patient
   needs rest to help w anxiety
   - continue ambien
   - continue citalopram
   # Goals of care
 DNR as per family meeting on [**2142-1-26**].  The patient
   family does not wish for her to receive further invasive therapies such
   as dialysis at this time.

   family does not wish for her to receive further invasive therapies such
   as dialysis at this time, although continuing on current pressor
   regimen OK.
   - multidisciplinary rounds to bring together any differing views on
   patient
s prognosis and goals of care prior to approaching family
   further on goals of care, further invasive therapies, etc.
   - once above is performed, again speak with the family concerning goals
   whether it should be all attempts to treat medical problems with the
   knowledge that such therapies are invasive and can cause discomfort and
   potential harm, non-escalation of invasive therapies, or comfort
   measures only.  Emphasize as much as possible both patient
s and
   family
s wishes in this regard.
   #. Hypotension/Shock:
   Likely mixed etiology, multifactorial.  Possible contribution from
   ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event or other.  Has component of
   cardiogenic shock which has remained stable.  Only on levophed,
   midodrine this AM, so appears to be hemodynamically stable.  Patient is
   not clamped down on exam.  More concerning currently is a potential
   infectious/septic etiology as patient has elevated white count although
   25.4 2 days ago was artifact from nucleated RBCs.  Continues to be
   tender in the abdomen, which suggests an abdominal source.  Ischemic
   bowel is also on the differential given [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive
   stools and previous lactate, although lactate has resolved.  C-diff
   negative.  Pancreatic pseudocyst still possible given previous findings
   on CT scan.
   - consider CT abdomen pending goals of care above.
   - continue current pressors
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still very low, and is not responding to lasix gtt and metolazone.
   Electrolytes still stable but creatinine continues to rise, and it is
   indicated to start it now if family wishes to try.  Family as of this
   writing prefers no dialysis.
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   # Leukocytosis:
   CBC yesterday showing worsening leukocytosis, possibly abdominal source
   w distension on exam and tenderness.  Known sinusitis, though not
   likely that severe.  Continues to spike fevers though not high fevers,
   not likely to have abscess.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had Vanc in system for last
   couple of days after stopping antibiotics in setting of decreased renal
   clearance.  Leukocytosis normal once nRBCs corrected for.  No longer on
   antibiotics.
   -          trend WBC, fever curve
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] restart antibiotics if WBC elevates further or if pt
   becomes more hemodynamically unstable or starts to spike higher fevers
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen/pelvis, again pending above.
   -          Add lipase
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved
   completely yesterday.  Increasing gap again with rising lactate.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be
   recurring.  PEA arrest likely secondary to added insult associated w
   ventilatory mechanics on top of another unclear process.  Resolved
   currently.
   - trend ABG, trend lactate
   - continue pressor support as needed
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential still, though p/f ratio not low.  Increased O2 requirement
   yesterday in setting of increased fluid intake and worsening renal
   failure.
   - I/O per above
   - cont lasix and metolazone trial
   - trach stitches should be removed
 contact [**Name (NI) **]
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now per Ultrasound. Improving
   transaminitis.  INR improved w 2 doses of vitamin K.
   - trend liver enzymes.
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  No recent
   episodes.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.
    # Nutrition:
   - switch to double calorie/renal/hepatic formulation.
   # Hyperglycemia: D5W overnight so elevated. Continue ISS.
   - ISS - adjust prn

   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] have seen and examined the patient. I have reviewed the above note

   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **].
   I would add the following remarks:
   I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). on the CCU team. Progress
   reviewed extensively during family discussion.
   DNR status discussed. DNR.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   Additional comments:
   Patient with anuric renal failure.  Concern regarding family and
   patient's wishes would not include renal replacement therapy.  The
   prognosis for recovery of renal function and that short term vs. long
   term dialysis would occur is grim, though I am still a bit uncertain.
   I would like to pursue a bit more time to see what happens to urine
   output before allowing her to succumb to renal failure secondary to her
   most recent cardiac arrest.  Critical care time surrouding ventilator
   managment, coordination of care and management of multiorgan failure
   and renal failure.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who presented to the ICU with a STEMI and cardiac arrest. She has undergone several interventions, including resuscitation, tandem heart, ECMO, PCI with BMS to LMCA with jailed LAD, and tracheostomy placement. The patient remains hemodynamically unstable and requires pressor support. Her renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by rising creatinine levels and low urine output. She has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 25.9 K/uL, likely due to an abdominal source. The patient also has abdominal distension and tenderness, guaiac positive stools, and a history of ischemic bowel. There is evidence of pulmonary edema, but the cause is unclear. The patient's metabolic acidosis has resolved, but there is an increasing gap with rising lactate levels. Her respiratory failure is likely secondary to pulmonary edema or acute congestive heart failure. The patient has transaminitis, likely due to shock liver, and coronary artery disease with previous STEMI and cardiogenic shock. She also has anemia, atrial fibrillation, and neurologic status that appears preserved. The patient's code status is DNR, and her family does not wish for her to receive further invasive therapies such as dialysis at this time.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has mixed etiology shock, with a likely contribution"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted after experiencing syncope, chest pain, and cardiac arrest. She has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery. The patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during the procedure and was subsequently placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). She developed ventricular tachycardia and had two episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and required vasopressor support for hemodynamic instability. A tracheostomy was performed, and the patient received a tandem heart device. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, and there are signs of abdominal tenderness and distension. She has guaiac-positive stools and a history of ischemic bowel. The patient's kidney function is deteriorating, and she has an ongoing metabolic acidosis. The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart failure. She also has transaminitis, anemia, and a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's neurological status is currently preserved.

   # Goals of care
 DNR as per family meeting on [**2142-1-26**].  The patient
   family does not wish for her to receive further invasive therapies such
   as dialysis at this time, although continuing on current pressor
   regimen OK.
   - multidisciplinary rounds to bring together any differing views on
   patient
s prognosis and goals of care prior to approaching family
   further on goals of care, further invasive therapies, etc.
   - once above is performed, again speak with the family concerning goals
   whether it should be all attempts to treat medical problems with the
   knowledge that such therapies are invasive and can cause discomfort and
   potential harm, non-escalation of invasive therapies, or comfort
   measures only.  Emphasize as much as possible both patient
s and
   family
s wishes in this regard.
   #. Hypotension/Shock:
   Likely mixed etiology, multifactorial.  Possible contribution from
   ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event or other.  Has component of
   cardiogenic shock which has remained stable.  Only on levophed,
   midodrine this AM, so appears to be hemodynamically stable.  Patient is
   not clamped down on exam.  More concerning currently is a potential
   infectious/septic etiology as patient has elevated white count although
   25.4 2 days ago was artifact from nucleated RBCs.  Continues to be
   tender in the abdomen, which suggests an abdominal source.  Ischemic
   bowel is also on the differential given [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive
   stools and previous lactate, although lactate has resolved.  C-diff
   negative.  Pancreatic pseudocyst still possible given previous findings
   on CT scan.
   - consider CT abdomen pending goals of care above.
   - continue current pressors
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still very low, and is not responding to lasix gtt and metolazone.
   Electrolytes still stable but creatinine continues to rise, and it is
   indicated to start it now if family wishes to try.  Family as of this
   writing prefers no dialysis.
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   # Leukocytosis:
   CBC yesterday showing worsening leukocytosis, possibly abdominal source
   w distension on exam and tenderness.  Known sinusitis, though not
   likely that severe.  Continues to spike fevers though not high fevers,
   not likely to have abscess.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had Vanc in system for last
   couple of days after stopping antibiotics in setting of decreased renal
   clearance.  Leukocytosis normal once nRBCs corrected for.  No longer on
   antibiotics.
   -          trend WBC, fever curve
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] restart antibiotics if WBC elevates further or if pt
   becomes more hemodynamically unstable or starts to spike higher fevers
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen/pelvis, again pending above.
   -          Add lipase
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved
   completely yesterday.  Increasing gap again with rising lactate.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be
   recurring.  PEA arrest likely secondary to added insult associated w
   ventilatory mechanics on top of another unclear process.  Resolved
   currently.
   - trend ABG, trend lactate
   - continue pressor support as needed
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential still, though p/f ratio not low.  Increased O2 requirement
   yesterday in setting of increased fluid intake and worsening renal
   failure.
   - I/O per above
   - cont lasix and metolazone trial
   - trach stitches should be removed
 contact [**Name (NI) **]
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now per Ultrasound. Improving
   transaminitis.  INR improved w 2 doses of vitamin K.
   - trend liver enzymes.
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  No recent
   episodes.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.
    # Nutrition:
   - switch to double calorie/renal/hepatic formulation.
   # Hyperglycemia: D5W overnight so elevated. Continue ISS.
   - ISS - adjust prn
   # Insomnia/ Depression:   Ambien works well intermittently.  Patient
   needs rest to help w anxiety
   - continue ambien
   - continue citalopram

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 76-year-old female who presented with a STEMI (heart attack) and cardiac arrest. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stenting of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) and left anterior descending artery (LAD), as well as ECMO support. 

The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications since admission. The note highlights several ongoing issues:

1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient has mixed etiology hypotension with a possible contribution from ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event, or other factors. There is also a concern for septic shock due to elevated white blood cell count and abdominal tenderness.

2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening AKI. The patient's urine output is very low and not responding to diuretics.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, which could be due to an abdominal source of infection or sinusitis. There have been ongoing fevers, but not high fevers.

4. Abdominal Distension/Tenderness: The patient has ongoing abdominal distension and tenderness without evidence of air-fluid levels on imaging. The patient is producing guaiac-positive stools.

5. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had elevated lactate levels during a code, which have since resolved. However, there"

   # Goals of care
 DNR as per family meeting on [**2142-1-26**].  The patient
   family does not wish for her to receive further invasive therapies such
   as dialysis at this time, although continuing on current pressor
   regimen OK.
   - multidisciplinary rounds to bring together any differing views on
   patient
s prognosis and goals of care prior to approaching family
   further on goals of care, further invasive therapies, etc.
   - once above is performed, again speak with the family concerning goals
   whether it should be all attempts to treat medical problems with the
   knowledge that such therapies are invasive and can cause discomfort and
   potential harm, non-escalation of invasive therapies, or comfort
   measures only.  Emphasize as much as possible both patient
s and
   family
s wishes in this regard.
   #. Hypotension/Shock:
   Likely mixed etiology, multifactorial.  Possible contribution from
   ventilator mechanics, pulmonary event or other.  Has component of
   cardiogenic shock which has remained stable.  Only on levophed,
   midodrine this AM, so appears to be hemodynamically stable.  Patient is
   not clamped down on exam.  More concerning currently is a potential
   infectious/septic etiology as patient has elevated white count although
   25.4 2 days ago was artifact from nucleated RBCs.  Continues to be
   tender in the abdomen, which suggests an abdominal source.  Ischemic
   bowel is also on the differential given [**Last Name (un) **] pain, guiaic positive
   stools and previous lactate, although lactate has resolved.  C-diff
   negative.  Pancreatic pseudocyst still possible given previous findings
   on CT scan.
   - consider CT abdomen pending goals of care above.
   - continue current pressors
   #. Acute kidney injury:
   Cr continues to uptrend, most likely progressive ATN.  Urine output
   still very low, and is not responding to lasix gtt and metolazone.
   Electrolytes still stable but creatinine continues to rise, and it is
   indicated to start it now if family wishes to try.  Family as of this
   writing prefers no dialysis.
   - lasix and metolazone today to try to keep from being too positive on
   fluid balance.  Goal even to slightly negative if at all possible.
   - appreciate renal consult
   - trend BUN/Cr
   # Leukocytosis:
   CBC yesterday showing worsening leukocytosis, possibly abdominal source
   w distension on exam and tenderness.  Known sinusitis, though not
   likely that severe.  Continues to spike fevers though not high fevers,
   not likely to have abscess.  [**Month (only) 8**] have had Vanc in system for last
   couple of days after stopping antibiotics in setting of decreased renal
   clearance.  Leukocytosis normal once nRBCs corrected for.  No longer on
   antibiotics.
   -          trend WBC, fever curve
   -          [**Month (only) 8**] restart antibiotics if WBC elevates further or if pt
   becomes more hemodynamically unstable or starts to spike higher fevers
   #. Abdominal distension/tenderness.  No evidence of air fluid levels on
   KUB.  She has continued to have stools, albeit continuously guiaic
   positive.
   -          will continue to monitor.
   -          CT abdomen/pelvis, again pending above.
   -          Add lipase
   #. Metabolic acidosis: elevated lactate to 12 during code, resolved
   completely yesterday.  Increasing gap again with rising lactate.
   Unclear etiology of initially acidosis prior to Code, may be
   recurring.  PEA arrest likely secondary to added insult associated w
   ventilatory mechanics on top of another unclear process.  Resolved
   currently.
   - trend ABG, trend lactate
   - continue pressor support as needed
   #. Hypoxemic respiratory failure:
   Likely secondary to pulmonary edema secondary to acute congestive heart
   failure, although hemorrhage, aspiration pneumonia, ARDS also on
   differential still, though p/f ratio not low.  Increased O2 requirement
   yesterday in setting of increased fluid intake and worsening renal
   failure.
   - I/O per above
   - cont lasix and metolazone trial
   - trach stitches should be removed
 contact [**Name (NI) **]
   - no pressure support trial today
   - continue sedation
   #. Transaminitis: Likely secondary to shock liver. No evidence of
   hepatic vein thrombosis right now per Ultrasound. Improving
   transaminitis.  INR improved w 2 doses of vitamin K.
   - trend liver enzymes.
   #. Coronary artery disease:  Patient is s/p STEMI and cardiogenic shock
   after PEA arrest.  s/p PCI [**1-17**] of LMCA.
   - continue plavix, aspirin, statin
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt for apical akinesis - watch hct
   #. Anemia: CT torso without evidence of intraabdominal bleed.  Has had
   guaiac + stools. Tandem heart, which appeared associated with anemia,
   has been removed.  Bronch clean.  On heparin drip. Hct stable.
   - will monitor Hct daily
   - transfuse if evidence of hypoperfusion
   #. Atrial fibrillation: Has been recurrent and intermittent.  No recent
   episodes.
   - continue amiodarone po
   - continue beta blocker
   - continue heparin gtt
   #. Neurologic status: appears to be preserved on exam this AM.
    # Nutrition:
   - switch to double calorie/renal/hepatic formulation.
   # Hyperglycemia: D5W overnight so elevated. Continue ISS.
   - ISS - adjust prn
   # Insomnia/ Depression:   Ambien works well intermittently.  Patient
   needs rest to help w anxiety

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted after experiencing syncope, chest pain, and cardiac catheterization. She has a history of coronary artery disease and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with bare-metal stent placement in the left main coronary artery. The patient also had a tandem heart procedure, ECMO, and tracheostomy placement. She was intubated due to respiratory distress and required pressors for hemodynamic support. The patient had two previous episodes of pulseless electrical activity (PEA) arrest, and her current condition is critical.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient is experiencing mixed etiology shock, which includes cardiogenic shock and possibly ventilator-associated pulmonary events or sepsis. There is also a concern for ischemic bowel given the abdominal tenderness, positive guaiac stools, and previous lactate levels.
2. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating progressive acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Urine output is low and not responding to diuretics. The family prefers no dialysis at this time.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has worsening leukocytosis, which may be due to an abdominal source of infection or sinusitis. There are concerns about potential abscess formation.
4. Abdominal Distension/Tenderness: The patient has ongoing abdominal distension and tenderness, which"
