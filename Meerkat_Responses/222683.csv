   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: Pt in new a-fib w/ RVR. Given his severe AS the patient is
   preload dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal
   agents.  He was started on esmolol gtt, digoxin, and heparin gtt in the
   ED. Unclear as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs.
   infection vs. PE (right axis) vs ACS, but less likely.  Esmolol was d/c
   given hypotension and lack of HR control and will plan for
   cardioversion.  Given severe AS patient is high risk at elevated rate.
   - plan for cardioversion at bedside with anesthesia
   - consider amio gtt
   - cont digoxin load and check ecg for toxicity
   - cont heparin gtt
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - pt already took home toprol xl. Will reassess after cardioversion
   - hold BP meds to allow for increase in BP.
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP this AM. CE showed Trop 0.33, CK 295, MB:
   19, MBI: 6.4. ECG showed old RBBB and new RAD. non-specific ST changes
   anteriorly and inferiorly at his fast rate. He already took ASA 325mg
   at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due to his severe
   AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention. No prior cath or h/o
   ACS, however high liklihood of cardiac disease given severe PVD. Pt
   currently CP free.  Elevation in cardiac enzymes likley combination of
   ARF and demand rather then thrombus.
   - trend CE
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA
   - hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF
   - ECG
   - monitor on tele
   - will keep NPO overnight for possible cath in AM
   .
   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   - check TTE
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS. Denied syncope, CHF, or CP (except episode
   today). Valve area 0.8-1.0cm2 and peak gradient 58mmHg
   - patient pre-load dependent
   - esmolol for rate control so that we can d/c if hypotensive
   - IVF
   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.
   - recheck UA
   - add on diff to check for eosinophilia
   - urine lytes and eos
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin
   - hold on prednisone until obtain records. Usually, will biopsy confirm
   AIN prior to treatment. Pt denied biopsy
   .
   #. UTI: Pt UA with WBC and RBC with many bacteria. Pt has no urinary
   complaints. Pt does have leukocytosis, but afebrile. Infection vs. GN.
   - tx with cipro
   - f/u Ucx
   .
   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above
   - f/u vascular consult recs
   - f/u LENI final read
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Infectious workup as above. UTI, cellulits. CXR no
   consolidation. Also patient has been on steroids.
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH. No clear source of blood
   loss. Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.
   - T&S
   - Fe studies
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hct
   .
   # Hyponatermia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatermia. Pt received 1.25L in
   the ED.
   - urine lytes and osm
   - IVF prn
   - cont to trend
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: although need to check albumin to correct for gap.
   No evidence of GI loss. Likely secondary to ARF.
   - check lactate
   - check albumin and recalculate gap
   - ARF management as above
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Diabetes: Diet controlled, but on admission glc 300's. Likely

   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2351**], [**Name (NI) 7045**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   As above, Mr. [**Known lastname 12127**] is a pleasant pharmacist who owns his own
   pharmacy in [**Location (un) 101**] who presents with AF with RVR and DOE for one week.
   He was recently diagnosed with ARF on CRF and was given steroids for ?
   Diclox induced renal failure. Fri evening prior to admission he
   developed palpitations with 5/10 chest pain. He presented to the ED and
   was found to be in AF with RVR at 120-140 bpm. Creat was 2.1. He was
   started on an Esmolol drip and given a bolus dose of 0.25 mg Digoxin
   without much reduction in heart rate and ongoing hypotension to
   80-90mmm systolic. He had ongoing hypotension so he was cardioverted
   with 200J sync cardioversion last night. This am he remained relatively
   hypotensive without symptoms. Two of 4 blood culture bottles were
   positive for GNR and so he was started on Miripenim, cipro and vanco.
   Biomarkers were continuing to rise. Therefore, it appears that the
   patient may have developed a UTI which led to bacteremia, hypotension
   the AF with RVR. Will check an echo today to evaluate the AoValve.
   Continue antibiotics for Urosepsis. His NSTEMi is likely demand related
   secondary to hypotension and AF with RVR and so I would recommend a
   cath for AS and coronary anatomy prior to d/c.
   Above discussed extensively with patient. Above discussed extensively
   with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 372**] or health care proxy. I have discussed
   this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 7045**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2351**].
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) 861**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD
   on:[**2189-12-21**] 07:14 PM ------
","The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He presents with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR) and dyspnea on exertion (DOE) for one week. The patient was recently diagnosed with acute renal failure (ARF) on chronic renal failure (CRF) and was given steroids for presumed dicloxacillin-induced renal failure. On Friday evening prior to admission, he developed palpitations with chest pain, and his creatinine level was 2.1. He was started on an esmolol drip and given a bolus dose of digoxin without much reduction in heart rate, and he continued to experience hypotension. The patient was cardioverted with 200J sync cardioversion last night. This morning, he remained relatively hypotensive without symptoms. Two of four blood culture bottles were positive for gram-negative rods (GNR), and he was started on meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Biomarkers were continuing to rise, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is likely demand-related secondary to hypotension and AF with RVR. It is recommended that the patient undergo cardiac catheterization for AS and coronary anatomy prior to discharge.

The patient underwent cardioversion and is currently in sinus rhythm (SR). However, he remains hypotensive with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in the 70-80s despite good mentation, urine output, and well-perfused extremities. The patient also has crackles and expiratory wheeze at right lower lobe (RLL), likely related to his severe AS.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin T, indicating possible acute kidney injury (AKI) and myocardial injury. Additionally, the patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, which may be related to his underlying medical conditions or recent interventions.

   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took ASA 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), severe aortic stenosis (AS), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diet-controlled diabetes, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) status post left axillary bifemoral bypass and left fem-pop bypass with infragenicular subcutaneous arteriovenous fistula (ISSV), presenting with atrial fibrillation (a-fib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) now converted to sinus rhythm (SR) following cardioversion. He has had a recent episode of chest pain (CP) prior to presentation with elevated cardiac enzymes (CE), but EKG without signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient is preload-dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia versus infection versus pulmonary embolism (PE) versus acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but less likely.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications:
- Development of heart failure due to severe AS.
- Possible progression to cardiogenic shock.
- Risk of arrhythmias, including recurrent a-fib or ventricular arrhythmias.
- Potential myocardial infarction due to demand ischemia.

2. Renal complications:
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to hypotension and reduced renal perfusion.
- Risk of further deterioration"

   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR. Given his severe AS the patient
   is preload dependent and hesitant to drop preload with IV push of nodal
   agents.  He was started on esmolol gtt, digoxin, and heparin gtt in the
   ED. Unclear as to what set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs.
   infection vs. PE (right axis) vs ACS, but less likely.  Esmolol was d/c
   given hypotension and lack of HR control and will plan for
   cardioversion.  Given severe AS patient is high risk at elevated rate.
   - plan for cardioversion at bedside with anesthesia
   - consider amio gtt
   - cont digoxin load and check ecg for toxicity
   - cont heparin gtt
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - pt already took home toprol xl. Will reassess after cardioversion
   - hold BP meds to allow for increase in BP.
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP this AM. CE showed Trop 0.33, CK 295, MB:
   19, MBI: 6.4. ECG showed old RBBB and new RAD. non-specific ST changes
   anteriorly and inferiorly at his fast rate. He already took ASA 325mg
   at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due to his severe
   AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention. No prior cath or h/o
   ACS, however high liklihood of cardiac disease given severe PVD. Pt
   currently CP free.  Elevation in cardiac enzymes likley combination of
   ARF and demand rather then thrombus.
   - trend CE
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA
   - hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF
   - ECG
   - monitor on tele
   - will keep NPO overnight for possible cath in AM
   .
   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   - check TTE
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS. Denied syncope, CHF, or CP (except episode
   today). Valve area 0.8-1.0cm2 and peak gradient 58mmHg
   - patient pre-load dependent
   - esmolol for rate control so that we can d/c if hypotensive
   - IVF
   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.
   - recheck UA
   - add on diff to check for eosinophilia
   - urine lytes and eos
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin
   - hold on prednisone until obtain records. Usually, will biopsy confirm
   AIN prior to treatment. Pt denied biopsy
   .
   #. UTI: Pt UA with WBC and RBC with many bacteria. Pt has no urinary
   complaints. Pt does have leukocytosis, but afebrile. Infection vs. GN.
   - tx with cipro
   - f/u Ucx
   .
   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above
   - f/u vascular consult recs
   - f/u LENI final read
   .
   #. Leukocytosis: Infectious workup as above. UTI, cellulits. CXR no
   consolidation. Also patient has been on steroids.
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - infectious workup as above.
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH. No clear source of blood
   loss. Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.
   - T&S
   - Fe studies
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hct

   # Hyponatermia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatermia. Pt received 1.25L in
   the ED.
   - urine lytes and osm
   - IVF prn
   - cont to trend
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: although need to check albumin to correct for gap.
   No evidence of GI loss. Likely secondary to ARF.
   - check lactate
   - check albumin and recalculate gap
   - ARF management as above
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Diabetes: Diet controlled, but on admission glc 300's. Likely

He presents with atrial fibrillation (a-fib) with rapid ventricular response. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72-108 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

The patient underwent cardioversion yesterday at 10:45 PM due to a-fib aflutter prior to dcc hr. He received a 128 synchron. shock of 200 j x1. The patient has been experiencing low blood pressure overnight, with systolic blood pressure in the 70-80s despite good mentation, urine output, and well-perfused extremities. He received a total of 1.5 liters of fluids overnight.

The patient's medications include heparin sodium at 1,100 units/hour, propofol, and other ICU medications. He also takes other medications including changes to his medical and family history.

On physical examination, the patient is oriented x3, with a mood and affect appropriate. His HEENT examination reveals no abnormalities, and his neck is supple with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 8 cm. The cardiac examination shows a point of maximal impulse"

   Echo: [**12-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional function is grossly
   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took ASA 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.
   - cont heparin gtt
   - cont ASA, hold plavix
   - cont BB, statin
   - holding ACEI given ARF
   - ECG , TTE in am
   - monitor on tele
   .
   # PUMP: Grade II dCHF. Patient appears hypovolemic on exam and no
   evidence of pulm edema on CXR.  Pt was on lasix at home despite ARF
   - daily weights, I/O, and monitor resp status
   - hold lasix given ARF
   - IVF prn for hypovolemia
   - check TTE
   .
   #. AS: Pt with severe AS severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8cm2, peak gradient 64mmhg and mean gradient 42mmHg). Denied syncope,
   CHF, or CP (except episode today).
   - patient pre-load dependent, transfuse with 2 UpRBC
   - IVF
   - TTE
   - management of AF as above
   .
   #. Bacteremia: [**2-11**] blood cx with GNR, leukocytosis but afebrile.  Has
   been on high dose steroids so at risk for serious infection.  Etiology:
   likely UTI vs cellulits bur would also consider hematoma, graft
   infection.  Currently on broad spectrum abx with meropenem, clinda and
   vancomycin (for LLE cellulitis)
   - monitor BP on A-line, keep MAP > 60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - imaging of lower extremity grafts to look for etiology of infection
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - ID consult
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.   Urine lytes consistent
   with prerenal  etiology
   - recheck UA
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin and pcn
   - hold on prednisone until obtain records. Usually, will biopsy confirm
   AIN prior to treatment. Pt denied biopsy
   .
   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .
   #. Lower Ext Cellulitis: Pt with likley left foot cellulitis. Pt
   evaluated by vascular who recommended abx treatment. U/S negative for
   DVT.  No other sx of compartment syndrome or acute lower extremity
   ischemia
   - Vanco IV for now
   - will also treat with cipro given UTI as above
   - f/u vascular consult recs
   - f/u LENI final read
   .
   #. Anemia: Pt states received 4U pRBC at OSH. No clear source of blood
   loss. Denied melana or BRBPR. Possible anemia from AS.  Iron studies
   consistent with anemia of chronich dx
 i.e. chronich renal
   insufficiency.  Large drop in Hct from overnight, not fully explained
   by dilution
   - T&S
   - transfuse with 2 UpRBC, consider adding lasix if sx of volume
   overload
   - guaiac stools
   - trend Hct
   .
   # Hyponatermia: Likely hypovolemic hyponatermia. Pt received 1.25L in
   the ED.
   - urine lytes and osm
   - IVF prn
   - cont to trend
   .
   # Non-Gap Acidosis: although need to check albumin to correct for gap.
   No evidence of GI loss. Likely secondary to ARF.
   - check lactate
   - check albumin and recalculate gap
   - ARF management as above
   - infectious workup as above
   .
   # Diabetes: Diet controlled, but on admission glc 300's. Likely
   combination of stress and initiation of steriods.
   - QACHS FS and cover with FS

   Echo: [**12-21**]: The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is
   moderately dilated. The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. There
   is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size
   and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Regional function is grossly
   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.

   # RHYTHM: present in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Unclear etiology as to what set off his a-fib, most likely caused by
   severe infection.  However, given CHADS score of 3, patient should be
   anticoagulated for now although could likely stop if remains in sinus
   rhythm
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation. Will start coumadin if no

   vs cellulits but would also consider seeding of hematoma, graft
   infection.  Currently on broad spectrum abx with meropenem, clinda and
   vancomycin (for LLE cellulitis)
   - hold steriods
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - imaging of lower extremity grafts to look for etiology of infection
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - appreciate ID recs
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took [**Month/Year (2) **] 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt, plavix held given
   possible need for surgical intervention.  [**Hospital 12172**] medical therapy as
   patient is not a good candidate for intervention given sepsis
   - cont [**Hospital **], statin
   - restart low dose b-blocker given improved hypotension, ACEI given

   #. AS: Pt with severe AS severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area
   0.8cm2, peak gradient 64mmhg and mean gradient 42mmHg). Denied syncope,
   CHF, or CP (except episode prior to discharge).  Candidate for AVR but
   not until infection resolves
   - patient pre-load dependent, bolus with IVF prn hypotension
   - management of AF as above

   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1, currently improving
   to 1.7.   Labs with borderline hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis.
   Reportly in ARF at OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started
   on prednisone.  UA showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential
   pre-renal, ATN, infection or obstruction. Urine lytes consistent with
   prerenal  etiology.  Renal U/S with no abnormality.  Pt with low
   platelets and anemia, but they are at his baseline and unchanged so
   unlikely TTP/HUS.
   - restart ACEI as renal function has improved
   - start sodium bicarb TID as per renal recs
   - hold on steroids as pt has severe systemic infection
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin and pcn

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. He was admitted with bacteremia due to E. coli, likely from a urinary tract infection or cellulitis in the left lower extremity. The patient's current condition includes acute kidney injury, anemia, non-gap metabolic acidosis, eosinophilia, and allergies to dicloxacillin and aspirin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.8 cm2 and mean gradient of 42 mmHg. This condition can lead to symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, syncope, and heart failure.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient has a history of ARF, possibly caused by a combination of factors including severe infection, hypotension, and use of nephrotoxic drugs. Close monitoring of renal function and adjustment of medications are necessary.
3. Eosinophilia: The patient has mild eosinophilia, which may indicate an allergic reaction or response to certain medications.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to chronic renal insufficiency. Further evaluation and management are required.
5. Lower Extremity Cellulitis: The patient may have cellulitis in the left lower extremity"

   normal ? Focal hypokinesis of basal inferior wall (clip [**Clip Number (Radiology) **]). Doppler
   parameters are indeterminate for left ventricular diastolic function.
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are severely thickened/deformed. There is
   severe aortic valve stenosis (valve area 0.8cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Mild to moderate ([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
   borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2189-8-27**], the
   estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is now lower. The severity
   of aortic stenosis is similar.
   Assessment and Plan
   77 yo M with dCHF (Grade II), severe AS (0.8-1.0cm2), HTN, HL, diet
   controlled DM, PVD s/p Left axillary bifemoral bypass [**2189-8-28**] and s/p
   left fem-pt bypass w/ ISSV [**2184**] presents with a-fib /w RVR.
   .
   # RHYTHM: present  in new a-fib w/ RVR now s/p cardioversion in NSR.
   Given his severe AS the patient is preload dependent and hesitant to
   drop preload with IV push of nodal agents. Unclear etiology as to what
   set off his a-fib. Possible hypovolemia vs. infection vs. PE (right
   axis) vs ACS, but less likely.
   - cont heparin gtt for anticoagulation
   - hold on CTA for now given ARF and already on heparin gtt. LENI
   negative. Consider V/Q scan
   - hold home nodal agents for now given hypotension
   - patient may been BP support with pressors. Will consider CVL and
   a-line for closer monitoring.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Pt reports CP prior to presentation with elevation of CE:
   peak CK 623 but EKG without signs of ACS.  Likely to be myocardial
   injury in the setting of demand ischemia but likely to benefit from
   cardiac cath prior to discharge given hx of severe PVD.  He already
   took [**Year (4 digits) **] 325mg at home and started on heparin gtt.  Plavix was held due
   to his severe AS and h/o PVD may need surgical intervention.  Currently
   CP free with downtrending CE.

   .
   #. Bacteremia: [**2-11**] blood cx with GNR, leukocytosis but afebrile.  Has
   been on high dose steroids so at risk for serious infection.  Etiology:
   likely UTI vs cellulits bur would also consider hematoma, graft
   infection.  Currently on broad spectrum abx with meropenem, clinda and
   vancomycin (for LLE cellulitis)
   - monitor BP on A-line, keep MAP > 60
   - trend fever curve and leukocytosis
   - imaging of lower extremity grafts to look for etiology of infection
   - continue meropenem, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin
   - f/u urine cx, blood cx
   - ID consult
   .
   # ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8-1.0. On admission was 2.1. Reportly in ARF at
   OSH and thought to be [**2-9**] Dicloxacillin and started on prednisone.  UA
   showed WBC and RBC. Also on the differential pre-renal, ATN, infection
   or obstruction. Pt with low platelets and anemia, but they are at his
   baseline and unchanged so unlikely TTP/HUS.   Urine lytes consistent
   with prerenal  etiology
   - recheck UA
   - hold lasix and ACEI
   - renal U/S
   - trend cr
   - renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   - OSH records regarding ARF and ?AIN
   - hold off on Dicloxacillin and pcn
   - hold on prednisone until obtain records. Usually, will biopsy confirm
   AIN prior to treatment. Pt denied biopsy
   .
   #. DOE: [**Doctor Last Name **] score 4.5, moderate prob. LENI negatives. Unable to
   obtain CTA given ARF. Pt already on heparin gtt. No evidence of
   consoliation or pulm edema.  DOE could be related to a-fib.
   - consider V/Q scan
   - management as above
   .

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 12127**] is doing very well today with no CP or SOB. Blood cultures
   are positive for E-coli likely urine source. BP much better now off his
   aggressive cardiac regimen and improvement in sepsis. Echo yesterday
   demonstrated AS with gradients 60 (peak)/42 (mean) with [**Location (un) 342**] 0.8 cm2.
   Vascular surgery and ID are following for potential seeding of his
   grafts with e-coli and so he remains on Miripenim, Vanco and Cipro
   until sensitivies return. Hct up to 24 from 21 after 2 u PRBC. For his
   NSTEMI he will continue [**Last Name (LF) 12170**], [**First Name3 (LF) 5**] and we will resume a lower dose of
   BB and ACEI. We will perform a PMIBI prior to discharge for risk
   stratification. Will continue coumadin for PAF on admission. DR.
   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 161**] who has seen the patient on prior hospital admissions will
   follow the patient on F3
   Above discussed extensively with patient. I have discussed this plan
   with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) **] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and current condition, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a baseline creatinine level of 0.8-1.0, which increased to 2.1 on admission. This indicates a decline in kidney function, possibly due to factors such as sepsis, dehydration, or the use of nephrotoxic medications.

2. Infective Endocarditis (IE): The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to positive blood cultures for E. coli. This raises concern for possible infective endocarditis, especially given the presence of a prosthetic graft.

3. Ventricular Arrhythmias: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm. There is a risk of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of severe AS and underlying cardiac conditions.

4. Myocardial Infarction: Although the patient's EKG did not show signs of acute coronary syndrome, the elevated peak CK level suggests myocardial injury. The patient's history of peripheral vascular disease and severe AS puts him at an increased risk for future myocardial infarctions.

5. Graft Infection: As the patient has a history of recent vascular surgery, there is a possibility of graft infection, especially considering"
