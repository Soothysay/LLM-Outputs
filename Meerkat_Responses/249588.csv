","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma and possible spine metastasis, presenting with a seizure from home and found to have likely new brain metastasis.
- She has a history of protein-losing enteropathy and was found to have acute respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 118/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, high sodium, slightly low potassium, and elevated liver enzymes.
- The patient has been started on levetiracetam for seizure management and dexamethasone for brain edema.
- She has been intubated due to the inability to protect her airway and is currently on mechanical ventilation.
- The plan includes consideration for extubation today, follow-up with neurosurgery for further evaluation and management of the brain mass, brain MRI for better characterization of the brain mass, follow-up with oncology for further management of lung cancer, and evaluation for possible pneumonia.
- The patient's atrial fibrillation is being managed with diltiazem, and warfarin is held due to the risk of intracranial bleeding.
- The patient has a history of abdominal surgeries for small bowel obstruction and has been on total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
- ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain metastasis: The patient's recent seizure and new brain lesion are concerning for brain metastasis from her lung cancer. This may lead to increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and seizures.
2. Pneumonia: The opacity in the right upper lobe of the lung suggests possible pneumonia, which could be aspiration-related given the patient's seizure episode. If untreated, it can progress to respiratory failure.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events such as stroke.
4. Protein-losing enteropathy: The patient's history of protein-losing enteropathy may lead to malnutrition and compromised immune function if not properly managed.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP, which can be a serious complication.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and hospitalization increase the risk of developing DVT, which can lead to pulmonary embolism if not prevented.

Please note that the potential complications listed are based on the information provided in the progress note and may not be an exhaustive list."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma, possible spine metastasis, and a history of protein-losing enteropathy. She presented with a seizure from home and was found to have likely new brain metastases. The patient is currently intubated and on ventilatory support due to her inability to protect her airway. She has been treated with levetiracetam for seizure management, dexamethasone for brain edema, and antibiotics for possible pneumonia. Her atrial fibrillation is currently in sinus rhythm, and she is on diltiazem for rate control. The plan is to continue seizure prophylaxis, evaluate for brain metastasis, and discuss further management with oncology.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Metastasis: The patient has likely new brain metastases, which can lead to neurological complications such as increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and cognitive dysfunction.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an opacity in the right upper lobe of her lung, concerning for aspiration pneumonia. This can progress to severe pneumonia and respiratory failure if not treated promptly.
3. Protein-Losing Enteropathy: The patient has a history of protein-losing enteropathy, which can lead to malnutrition and complications related to poor nutritional status.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and although currently in sinus rhythm, there"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma and possible spine metastases. She presented with a seizure at home and was found to have likely new brain metastases. The patient has a history of protein-losing enteropathy and is currently intubated due to respiratory failure. She requires ventilatory support and is being considered for extubation today. Imaging studies, such as a brain MRI, are pending. The patient is planned to undergo CyberKnife treatment for her lung cancer, which is likely stage IV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure with altered mental status: The patient's recent seizure and altered mental status are likely due to new brain metastases from her lung cancer. This is a concerning complication that requires ongoing management with antiepileptic medication and close neurological follow-up.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure necessitates ongoing ventilatory support. The healthcare team should carefully consider the timing of extubation and monitor the patient's ability to protect her airway.
3. Pneumonia: The opacity in the right upper lobe of the patient's lung raises concern for aspiration pneumonia or community-acquired pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics have been initiated, and further diagnostic tests, such as sputum cultures, are pending.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement: The patient has been diagnosed with a right"

   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which is concerning for brain mets from her lung ca. Not a good
   surgical candidate.
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - continue dexamethasone 4mg q6h
   - Has required ventilatory support given inability to protect airway.
   Consider extubation today
   - f/u neurosurg recs
   - brain MRI for better characterization of brain mass

   # Lung cancer: recent transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
   With suspected spine mets and now with likely new brain mets. Likely
   stage IV. Has been planned to undergo CyberKnife treatment.
   - f/u oncology recs re: further management
   .
   # Possible pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in
   the setting of seizure. Patient does have a history of MRSA bacteremia
   and VRE from abdominal wound.
   - empiric pip-tazo and vanco for now given patient's history of
   frequent hospitalizations; will narrow abx if clinical status and
   culture data permit

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a recent diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma and possible spine metastases. She presented with a seizure from home and was found to have likely new brain metastases. The patient has a history of protein-losing enteropathy and requires ventilatory support due to her inability to protect her airway. She is currently being treated with levetiracetam for seizures, dexamethasone for brain edema, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible pneumonia. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which she is taking diltiazem, and her warfarin has been held due to the risk of intracranial bleeding. She is expected to undergo CyberKnife treatment for her lung cancer and brain MRI for further characterization of the brain mass. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Brain Metastases: The patient's recent brain metastases can lead to complications such as increased intracranial pressure, neurological deficits, and seizures.
2. Pneumonia: The opacity in the right upper lobe of the patient's lung suggests possible pneumonia. Complications may include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis, and respiratory distress.
3. Protein-Losing Enteropathy: This condition can lead to malnutrition and electrolyte imbalances if not managed properly.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation may increase the"

","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of adenocarcinoma of the lung and multiple brain nodules. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure secondary to a seizure and inability to protect her airway. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation but is expected to be extubated in the morning. She also has deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter has been placed. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 73 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 135/62 mmHg to 149/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.7 K/uL, elevated glucose level of 153 mg/dL, and slightly low platelet count of 130 mg/dL. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient has a history of allergies to metronidazole, nausea/vomiting, and rash/exfoliation. She has been receiving various antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and ceftriaxone. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this patient include pulmonary"

   76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma with
   possible spine mets, history of protein-losing enteropathy, presented
   with seizure from home, found to have new brain mets.
   .
   Plan:
   # Seizure with altered mental status: most likely from new brain
   lesion, which are most likely brain mets from her lung ca. Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of
   neurosurgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] yesterday and stated he does not think there
   is a role for neurosurgery at this pt. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 810**] from Rad onc also came
   by and talked with the family who would like to pursue total brain
   radiation to begin today or tomorrow- he will be by again today to
   consent the pt.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] from heme/onc was also here yesterday for
   a family mtg where they discussed the pt's current situation and total
   brain radiation was decided as the preferable option at this time. The
   family and pt also made her status DNR/DNI last night
   - continue levetiracetam 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **] for now
   - continue dexamethasone 4mg q6h
   - Rad onc to consent pt and start total brain radiation today or
   tomorrow
   .
   # Lung cancer: recent transbronchial biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma.
   With suspected spine mets and now with new brain mets. Stage IV.
   -Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**] is primary oncologist and following pt
   -Rad onc to start total brain radiation as above.
   .
   # Pneumonia: with opacity in RUL, concerning for aspiration in the
   setting of seizure, but more likley CAP. Sputum culture with no growth
   to date.
   - Day 3 ceftriaxone today
   - f/u sputum cx
   - blood cx pend
   .
   # RLE DVT: IVC filter placed [**10-28**]
   - hold off on coumadin given risk of bleeding with brain mets
   .
   # Atrial fibrillation: currently in sinus rhythm.
   - continue dilt 60 mg q8h
   - hold warfarin given risk of intracranial bleeding; INR 1.0 currently
   .
   # Protein-losing enteropathy: most recently on TPN in [**2191-5-26**]. S/p abd
   surgeries for SBO.
   - will discuss possible need for speech and swallow eval and/or
   nutrition consult today. Pt needs to be started on PO diet if possible.
   Nursing notes she is taking pills with liquids with no coughing or
   other signs of aspiration at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 76-year-old woman with recently diagnosed lung adenocarcinoma and possible spine metastases.
- She presented with a seizure from home and was found to have new brain metastases.
- The patient's current condition includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, respiratory failure, and a history of protein-losing enteropathy.
- The patient's family has decided to pursue total brain radiation, which will be started today or tomorrow.
- The patient's code status has been changed to DNR/DNI (do not resuscitate/do not intubate).
- The patient's medical history includes lung cancer with suspected spine metastases, pneumonia with sputum culture without growth, RLE DVT with an IVC filter placed, atrial fibrillation currently in sinus rhythm, and protein-losing enteropathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient already has a confirmed DVT in the lower extremity. There is a risk of developing further DVTs or pulmonary embolism if anticoagulation is not properly managed.
2. Brain metastases: The patient has new brain metastases from her lung cancer. This can lead to neurological symptoms, increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and potential complications from radiation therapy.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has an opacity in the right upper lobe of the lung, which could"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung and multiple CNS lesions, who presented with respiratory failure and was admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully weaned off after 24 hours. He is currently on mechanical ventilation support via a nasal cannula, with an oxygen saturation level of 94%. The patient has a deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremity, for which an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was placed. He is not anticoagulated due to brain metastases. The patient also experienced a seizure but has been seizure-free on keppra. His current medications include famotidine, heparin sodium, and other ICU medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was acute respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. Although he has been successfully weaned off mechanical ventilation, there is still a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or further respiratory failure if proper respiratory support and precautions are not maintained.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been diagnosed with DVT in the lower extremity, which increases the risk of pulmonary embolism if not appropriately managed. The placement of an IVC filter helps reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism, but anticoagulation should be considered carefully due to the patient's brain metast"
