   Chief Complaint: Sepsis/Hypotension
   24 Hour Events:
   -Hct 49.4 in PM
   -Still requiring small doses of Neo in PM.
   -Got femoral line and post-pyloric tube in IR
   -Renal recs: no CVVH for now, give bicarb to correct acidosis
   -Contact[**Name (NI) **] ERCP attending [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 9526**] (cell [**Telephone/Fax (1) 9527**]) at
   [**Hospital1 966**] to update, he felt procedure was clean and was wondering about a
   recurrent HD line infection.
   -Surgery recs serial LFTs, pancreatic enzymes and ongoing fluid
   resusciation
   -Aggressive hydration for severe pancreatitis.  Got 4 liters LR, then
   3amps of Bicarb in 1L D5W, then another 3 liters NS. 7+ liter POS by
   midnight.
   --Started Meropenem in place of Zosyn in AM.  Grew GNRs in blood
   cultures from [**Hospital1 1504**] 2/2 bottles.  Started on Gentamycin and
   Linezolid, d/c'd Vancomycin.
   -Hyperglycemic in PM to ~300, sliding scale added
   -Off Neo at 1900, now on Levophed alone
   -K down to 5.5, LFTs / Amylase / Lipase trending down.  Hct down to
   41.5 this AM.  Calcium repleted.

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/getamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**], will check femoral line CVP, will also
   check delta pulse pressure
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   -- will get echo to assess heart function with all these fluids, check
   OSH records for any previous TTe
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- should be dialyzed today, will touch base with renal team
   -- can likely do hemodialysis but if BP drops, may need CVVH
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""
   -- holding lovenox for now, will clarify coagulation needs by getting
   OSH records
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early intiation
   of TF's via OGT when possible, will obtain nutrition c/s

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, who presented with sepsis, pancreatitis, and choledocholithiasis. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.

2. Pancreatitis: The patient has severe pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis, pseudocysts, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to pancreatitis. If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of developing respiratory failure, which may require prolonged mechanical ventilation.

4. Renal Failure: The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. If not properly managed, the patient may experience worsening renal function, leading to further complications.

5. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be compromised due to sepsis, hypotension, and fluid overload. Monitoring and management of the patient's hemodynamics are crucial to prevent complications such as myocardial infarction or heart failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   49F with SLE on chronic steroids, ESRD on HD, ERCP earlier today for
   choledocholithiasis, who presented with sepsis and pancreatitis.
   .
   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue vanc/zosyn for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**]
   -- continue vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- check central venous sat, maintain at goal >70%
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- place a-line for oxygenation and BP monitoring
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- renal c/s in AM, may need CVVH with tenous BPs
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""
   -- holding lovenox for now given ? need for procedures,
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: NPO for now given pancreatitis, but prefer early intiation
   of TF's via OGT when possible, will obtain nutrition c/s

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on chronic steroids, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and recent ERCP for choledocholithiasis. The patient presented with sepsis and severe pancreatitis. 

Summary:
- The patient's condition remains critical, with ongoing fluid resuscitation and aggressive hydration for severe pancreatitis.
- The patient is still requiring small doses of norepinephrine.
- Femoral line and post-pyloric tube were placed in the intensive care unit.
- Renal recommendations include no continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH) for now, but bicarbonate was given to correct acidosis.
- Contact was made with the ERCP attending regarding a recurrent central venous catheter (CVC) infection.
- Surgery recommendations include serial liver function tests (LFTs), pancreatic enzymes, and ongoing fluid resuscitation.
- The patient has been started on gentamicin and linezolid due to the growth of Gram-negative rods (GNRs) in blood cultures.
- Hyperglycemia is present, and a sliding scale has been added.
- The patient is off norepinephrine at 1900 and now on levophed alone.
- Laboratory values such as potassium, LFTs, amylase, lipase, and hematocrit are trending down.

   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.  Will d/w ERCP.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use
          Will transducer femoral CVP and assess pulse pressure
   variation to guide further volume repletion

   Continue present support during shock state
   Keep sedation as light as feasible
   Daily SBTs per protocol

   Unclear at present what her history is
 reported history of PE and
coumadin resistance
 certainly raises the possibility of
   antiphospholipid syndrome.  Apparently on enoxaparin as outpatient but
   in obese patient on dialysis not completely clear to me about whether
   this represents therapeutic or prophylactic dosing.  Will try to get
   old records today; if unable then will therapeutically anticoagulate
   with heparin
   Complex vascular access
   Multiple upper great vein stents

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure. She has a complex medical history, including lupus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), vascular stents, and recent instrumentation of the biliary tract. The patient's current condition includes:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is experiencing septic shock, which is characterized by low blood pressure and inadequate tissue perfusion. This is indicated by her vital signs, including a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 103/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation support due to respiratory failure. Her ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 360 mL, respiratory rate set at 16 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has pancreatitis, as evidenced by elevated pancreatic enzymes. The plan includes appreciating surgery and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and holding off on tube feeds for today while still on pressor support.

4. End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): The patient has ESRD and requires dialysis. The plan includes a trial of hem"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions. The patient has septic shock and respiratory failure, and is also diagnosed with chronic renal failure, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/70 mmHg to 89/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight is currently 81 kg, with a height of 67 inches.

The patient is sedated and unable to provide history. They have allergies to ace inhibitors, levaquin, cephalosporins, oxycodone, and percocet. The patient has received multiple antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the addition of abdominal pain. The physical examination reveals overweight/obesity with a cushingoid appearance, clear breath sounds, diminished radial pulses, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Neurologic examination shows no spontaneous movement but responds to noxious stimuli with normal tone.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels. Other lab values such as potassium"

   #. Sepsis - probable biliary source but DDX includes line infection.
   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**] in the past.
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/gentamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- CVP on femoral line have been in the 20
s so likely can continue to
   back off on fluids
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She had evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, and received aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now for transfer
   -- ultimately, volume management with dialysis
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   -- RSBI favorable today for extubation, will defer until after transfer
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are now within normal
   limit, has been downtrending.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now, may start tube feeds today or tomorrow
   per surgery recs
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- had CVVHD yesterday with good effect and K now within normal limits
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on Lovenox as an outpatient, was started on heparin gtt
   yesterday for h/o antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
   -- continue heparin gtt
   ICU Care

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of SLE, ESRD on HD, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome who presented with sepsis, pancreatitis, and choledocholithiasis. She underwent ERCP for choledocholithiasis and has been admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple medical complications including sepsis (probable biliary source), respiratory failure, pancreatitis, ESRD, SLE, and a history of pulmonary embolism.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis - The patient has sepsis with a probable biliary source. It is important to monitor blood cultures and continue broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover multidrug-resistant organisms.
2. Respiratory Failure - The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. Weaning off ventilator support will depend on maintaining adequate oxygenation and removing fluid overload.
3. Pancreatitis - The patient has pancreatitis secondary to ERCP. Aggressive fluid management, bowel rest, and pain control are necessary. Trend pancreatic enzymes and liver function tests daily.
4. ESRD - The patient has ESRD and requires CVVHD for renal support. Medications should be dosed based on renal function.
5. SLE - The patient is on stress dose steroids and should continue Plaquenil and Bactrim prophylaxis.
6. History of PE - The patient has"

   Has h/o multidrug resistant organisms at [**Hospital1 966**].
   -- f/u blood cultures (and those from [**Hospital1 1504**] ER)
   -- continue meropenem/getamicin/linezolid for broad coverage
   -- prn fluid for CVP goal [**9-25**], will check femoral line CVP, will also
   check delta pulse pressure
   -- wean vasopressors for MAP > 65
   -- continue stress dose steroids for now
   -- f/u ERCP c/s recs
   -- f/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] c/s recs
   -- will get echo to assess heart function with all these fluids, check
   OSH records for any previous TTe
   .
   #. Resp Failure - Was intubated for airway protection, never dropped
   saturations or demonstrated problems with oxygenation. She has evidence
   of volume overload on CXR, will need aggressive IVF for sepsis and
   pancreatitis management, so this will be a barrier to extubation in the
   future.
   -- wean FiO2 as tolerated, keep on AC for now
   -- ultimately, volume management will be via HD/CVVH
   -- send sputum cultures
   -- fent/midaz for sedation
   .
   #. Pancreatitis s/p ERCP - no evidence of persistent obstruction or
   free air on CT scan. However, pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and HCT
   acutely elevated c/w pancreatitis.
   -- aggressive IVF
   -- NPO with bowel rest for now
   -- pain control with IV fentanyl
   -- trend LFTs and panc enzymes daily
   -- ERCP to follow
   .
   #. ESRD
   -- should be dialyzed today, will touch base with renal team
   -- can likely do hemodialysis but if BP drops, may need CVVH
   -- renally dose all medications
   .
   #. SLE
   -- currently on stress dose steroids, replacing her home dose
   -- continue Plaquenil 200mg daily
   -- continue Bactrim SS daily for prophylaxis
   .
   # h/o PE - on despite ESRD [**3-18**] ""coumadin resistence""
   -- holding lovenox for now, will clarify coagulation needs by getting
   OSH records

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on chronic steroids, end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and sepsis and acute pancreatitis. The patient presented with choledocholithiasis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) earlier today.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient is suspected to have sepsis, possibly from a biliary source. There is a possibility of line infection as well. Blood cultures have been obtained and broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem, gentamicin, and linezolid) are being continued.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection due to respiratory failure. She has evidence of volume overload on the chest X-ray, which may make extubation challenging in the future. The plan is to wean FiO2 as tolerated and manage fluid balance through hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVH).

3. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, likely secondary to the ERCP procedure. There is no evidence of persistent obstruction or free air on the CT scan. Pancreatic enzymes are elevated, and aggressive intravenous fluid management is required. The patient will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth"

   Assessment and Plan
   49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure in the
   setting of a very complex prior medical history (lupus, ESRD, vascular
   stents, etc.) and recent instrumentation of biliary tract.
   Septic shock
          Growing GNR in blood cultures at the [**Hospital1 1504**]; speciation
   pending.
          This puts biliary-related disease higher on the
   differential, although GNRs can also be line pathogens.
          Based on prior culture data, she is on linezolid,
   gentamicin, and meropenem while awaiting current culture data.  Gent
   level today was 1.5; got re-dosed.
          She has had good response to volume resuscitation, coming
   off of one pressor.  Femoral CVP and low stroke-volume variation (based
   on pulse contour analysis) suggests that she is adequately volume
   replete.
          On stress dose steroids given chronic steroid use

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old woman with septic shock and respiratory failure. She has a complex medical history including lupus, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), vascular stents, and recent instrumentation of the biliary tract. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics (linezolid, gentamicin, and meropenem) while awaiting culture data.

She has shown a good response to volume resuscitation and is coming off of one pressor. Her femoral central venous pressure (CVP) and low stroke-volume variation suggest that she is adequately volume replete. The patient is also receiving stress dose steroids due to chronic steroid use.

The patient's respiratory status is concerning as she is on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube. Her respiratory system compliance is 16.4 cmH2O/mL, and she has a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 410. The ABG results show a pH of 7.32, indicating respiratory acidosis.

Regarding her renal function, the patient has end-stage renal disease and will likely require dialysis after the resolution of the shock state. Her serum creatinine levels are elevated at 6.5-6.7 mg/dL.

The patient also has a history of lupus, antiphospholipid syndrome, and multiple upper great vein stents. She is on plaquenil and steroids for her SLE and is also receiving b"
