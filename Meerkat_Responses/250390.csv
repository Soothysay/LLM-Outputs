","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a chief complaint of blood pressure dropping into the 80s transiently and responding to IVF boluses. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure, hypotension, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving various treatments including dialysis, nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83-89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent, and atrial flutter heart rhythm. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, potassium, and lactic acid levels. The patient's weight is currently 92.6 kg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low despite receiving IVF boluses, indicating potential ongoing hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ hypoxia.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests worsening renal function. This increases the risk of fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and accumulation of waste products.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient is labeled as sepsis without organ dysfunction, the elevated white blood cell"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction (CAD s/p MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous klebsiella urinary tract sepsis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella sepsis.
- The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, weakness, leukocytosis, hypotension, and fever, which are concerning for sepsis.
- The patient received vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and Zosyn, which cover his previous MRSA, MDR E.coli, and ESBL Klebsiella.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is on thrice-weekly hemodialysis.
- The patient has chronic renal failure, hypotension not in shock, and sepsis without organ dysfunction.
- The patient's other medical conditions include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation, depression, and fenfluramine use.
- The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 83/41 to 104/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent, and an ECG showing atrial flutter.
- The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and lactate levels, as well as low platelet count.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no peripheral pulses or skin assessment, and neurologic assessment is also not performed.
- The patient's current medications include heparin sodium for prophylaxis, other ICU medications, and changes to medical and family history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation of nausea, vomiting, weakness, leukocytosis, hypotension, and fever indicates sepsis. The patient's history of previous MDR bacteremias increases the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on hemodialysis. There may be further deterioration in renal function due to sepsis and other underlying conditions.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This could be due to sepsis, renal failure, or other cardiovascular issues.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which may be exacerbated by the infection and stress on the cardiovascular system.
5. MDR Infections: The patient's history of MDR bacteremias increases the risk of recurrent infections with antibiotic-resistant organisms.
6. VAP (Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia): Although the patient is not currently on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP if the patient requires intubation in the future.
7. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): The patient is at increased risk for D"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, C. difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteremias including ESBL Klebsiella, MRSA, and VRE urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness in the setting of leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures remain negative to date.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information are:

1. Sepsis: The patient is likely experiencing sepsis, as indicated by the presence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and hypotension (low blood pressure). The sources of infection could be related to his history of MDR bacteremias, such as ESBL Klebsiella, MRSA, and VRE UTI.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on hemodialysis. His current renal function should be monitored closely, and any further deterioration may require adjustments in his dialysis regimen.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating ongoing hypotension. Close monitoring"

   Total time spent:
","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of chronic renal failure on hemodialysis (ESRD), atrial fibrillation/flutter, C. difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug-resistant (MDR) bacteremias including ESBL Klebsiella, MRSA, and VRE urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness in the setting of leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures remain negative to date.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Renal Failure, Chronic: The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and is on hemodialysis.
2. Hypotension (Not Shock): The patient's blood pressure is low but not in shock.
3. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of sepsis but without any organ dysfunction at this time.

Potential Medical Complications that can arise:
1. Infection: Given the patient's history of multiple drug-resistant bacteremias, there is a high risk of infection. It is crucial to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation/flutter, CAD, and diastolic CHF. Close monitoring of the patient's cardiac status is necessary to prevent any cardiac complications.
3. Fluid Imbalance: Due to the patient's renal failure and ongoing losses from various sources, careful management of fluid balance is required to avoid fluid overload or under-resuscitation.
4. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to diverticulosis. Further evaluation with colonoscopy and follow-up are recommended to identify the source of bleeding and determine appropriate management.
5. Respiratory Issues: The patient has a history of COPD and is currently experiencing worsening crackles on lung examination. Weaning off oxygen and using incentive spirometry may be beneficial in improving respiratory function.
6. Depression: The patient is taking fluoxetine for depression. Monitoring for any psychiatric complications or side effects of the medication is important.

It is essential to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical condition to promptly identify and manage any potential medical complications."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous Klebsiella urinary tract sepsis, multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli sepsis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. He presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics including linezolid, meropenem, and vancomycin, which have been adjusted based on blood culture results. He also has a positive urine culture for yeast.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple drug-resistant infections, and his current symptoms along with leukocytosis and hypotension raise concerns for sepsis. The ongoing management involves continuous monitoring of vital signs, trending fever and white blood cell (WBC) curve, following up with infectious disease recommendations, and considering new line placement if blood cultures are positive.
2. ESRD on HD: The patient is on thrice-weekly dialysis, and renal awareness is essential. Ensuring adequate fluid balance and electrolyte management is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug-resistant infections including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella urosepsis, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli sepsis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness, along with leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures remain negative to date. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is being treated for septic shock likely due to a urinary tract infection (UTI) with yeast growth. He is also being managed for chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypotension, atrial fibrillation, depression, and COPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Given the patient's pre-existing chronic renal failure and recent hypotension, there is a risk of AKI due to inadequate renal perfusion or potential medication nephrotoxicity.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can be caused by aspiration of secretions or colonization of the endotracheal tube.
3. Catheter-Related Bloodstream Infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple lines and catheters in place, increasing the risk of CRBSI. Regular monitoring and appropriate care of these lines are crucial to prevent infection.
4. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): Although not mentioned in the history, the patient's glucose levels are within normal range, but careful monitoring is still advised due to the risk of developing DKA, especially if the patient's blood sugar control deteriorates.
5. Pressure Ulcers: Immobility and prolonged bed rest in the ICU may increase the risk of pressure ulcers, which can complicate wound healing and lead to infections.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin should be continued to prevent thromboembolic events.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note. It is essential to consult with the patient's healthcare team for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), history of Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) sepsis, multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) sepsis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. He has culture-negative sepsis, meaning no specific pathogen was identified on cultures. All antibiotics have been stopped, and the patient will have surveillance cultures as an outpatient.

The patient is on maintenance hemodialysis three times a week. He also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), for which he takes home Spiriva and Atrovent. The patient's atrial fibrillation/flutter is currently in sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy. It is believed that the atrial fibrillation was likely triggered by the infection. The patient was recently on rate control medication (ROMI), and his thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal, so he will continue taking home aspirin"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli) sepsis. He presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. The patient has culture-negative sepsis with nothing isolated on cultures, and all antibiotics have been stopped. He will have surveillance cultures as an outpatient.

The patient is on thrice-weekly hemodialysis and is renal aware. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is currently on home Spiriva and Atrovent treatments. The patient was recently in atrial fibrillation but is currently in sinus rhythm with frequent ectopy. It is likely that the atrial fibrillation was in the setting of infection. The patient underwent rapid optimization of medication in the intensive care unit (ROMI) and has a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. He will continue home on aspirin (ASA). The patient also has depression and is on home Fluoxetine.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) post-myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), previous Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI) and sepsis caused by multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli (MDR E. coli), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis. The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. He has culture-negative sepsis with no organisms isolated on cultures, and all antibiotics have been stopped. The patient will have surveillance cultures as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a history of multiple sepsis episodes, including Klebsiella UTI, MDR E. coli sepsis, and MRSA sepsis. The current presentation with nausea, vomiting, and weakness could indicate another sepsis episode, especially since the patient has culture-negative sepsis.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient's blood glucose levels are within normal range, so DKA is less likely. However, close monitoring of glucose levels should be maintained.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident x 2, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction, diastolic congestive heart failure, history of Klebsiella urinary tract infection, multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli sepsis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus sepsis. The patient presents with one day of nausea, vomiting, and weakness. The patient has culture-negative sepsis with nothing isolated on cultures. All antibiotics have been stopped, and the patient will have surveillance cultures as an outpatient.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of multiple infections including C. difficile, Klebsiella UTI, MDR E. coli sepsis, and MRSA sepsis. There is a potential for developing new infections due to immunosuppression or inadequate antibiotic treatment.
2. Cardiovascular issues: The patient has a history of CAD, diastolic CHF, and atrial fibrillation/flutter. These conditions increase the risk of cardiac complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure exacerbation, or myocardial infarction.
3. Renal function: The patient has ESRD and is on hemodialysis. There is a potential risk of worsening renal function or complications related to dialysis access.
4. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and the use of prophylactic heparin.
5. Respiratory problems: The patient has a history of COPD and may be at risk for respiratory infections or exacerbation of his underlying lung disease.
6. Gastrointestinal issues: The patient's recent symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and weakness could indicate gastrointestinal problems, which may require further evaluation and management.
7. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and is taking fluoxetine. There is a potential for psychiatric complications or inadequate management of depressive symptoms.
8. Medication interactions: The patient is on multiple medications, which may interact with each other and increase the risk of adverse effects or drug toxicity.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information from other sources may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection, cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug-resistant infections including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli sepsis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sepsis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) UTI. The patient presents with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness, along with leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures remain negative to date.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Impaired balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, and transfers.
2. Impaired respiration/gas exchange.
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction, resolved off all antibiotics.
4. Large bowel irregularity (LGI bleed): still experiencing diarrhea, outpatient gastrointestinal workup recommended.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): on home medications, small oxygen requirement due to atelectasis, continue incentive spirometry.
6. Atrial fibrillation (Afib):"

","The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x2, coronary artery disease (CAD) status post myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous Escherichia coli (E. coli), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) urinary tract infections (UTIs). He presented with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness, along with leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures are currently negative.

The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which has resolved and he is off all antibiotics. He will undergo surveillance cultures during hemodialysis. Additionally, he still has diarrhea and may require a proctoscopy once he recovers. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is on home medications with a small oxygen requirement due to atelectasis, continuous incentive spirometry (IS), and rate-controlled atrial fibrillation (Afib) not anticoagulated. He is also taking fluoxetine for depression, taking good oral intake, and his blood pressure appears at baseline.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, atrial fibrillation/flutter, Clostridium difficile infection (C.diff), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) x 2, coronary artery disease (CAD) with previous myocardial infarction (MI), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and multiple drug-resistant infections including ESBL Klebsiella urinary tract infection (UTI), MDR E.coli sepsis, MRSA sepsis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) UTI. The patient presented with one day of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness, accompanied by leukocytosis and hypotension. All cultures remain negative to date.

The patient was diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, which has since resolved and he is now off all antibiotics. The healthcare team plans to obtain surveillance cultures during hemodialysis. Other ongoing issues include large intestinal (LGI) bleed, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atrial fibrillation (Afib), depression, and functional decline (FEN). The patient is currently taking good oral intake and his blood pressure appears at baseline.

The patient's potential medical complications may include impaired balance, gait, knowledge, muscle performance, transfers, and respiration/gas exchange. The patient may also be at risk for further gastrointestinal bleeding"
