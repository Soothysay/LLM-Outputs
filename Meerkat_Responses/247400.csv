   seen as
   an area of bronchiectasis ([**2169-12-30**]), ground-glass ([**2172-4-8**]), and
   consolidation ([**2172-3-31**]) - findings suggest recurrent infection in a
   region
   of focal bronchiectasis.
   2. New small left and tiny right pleural effusions.
   3. Scattered tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) **] opacities which may represent inflammation or
   infection.
   4. Extensive chest wall and mediastinal collateral vascularization and
   prominence of the azygos vein, likely due to known occlusion of the SVC
   and
   brachiocephalic veins.
   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with ALL and recent VRE bacteremia who
   comes with acute-on-chronic poor medical status, with increasing
   tachypnea, tachycardia, and temperature.
   #) s/p asystolic arrest:  Likely cause was toxicity from calcium
   channel blockade.  Her tachyarthymia may have been secondary to
   sympathetic output from fevers in the setting of a heart compromised by
   prior anthracycline toxicity.  Currently her pupils are reactive and
   she responds to stimulation.
   - monitor electrolytes q6h and replete PRN
   - trend lactate
   - no further nodal agents
   - head CT to evaluate for severe neurologic damage
   .
   #) respiratory failure:  intubated in the peri-code setting.  ABGs
   during the day yesterday indicated primary metabolic alkalosis.
   Possibilities for etiology include intracranial process, drug effect,
   PE.  Could not evaluate for PE yesterday because of reported allergy to
   contrast (patient was unable to define further.)  No obvious drug
   offenders on her list.
   - CT head to evaluate for intracranial process
   - LENIs to evaluate for source of PE
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   #) hypotension:  blood pressures were very labile prior to the code.
   She is currently requiring a small dose of neo.
   - wean neo as tolerated
   .
   #) fevers:  On ciprofloxacin+dapto+meropenem.  Recent cultures with VRE
   but none since [**4-11**]. CSF findings concerning for infection seeding her
   CSF.  It is possible that her Ommaya is confaminated.  Also would be
   concerned for infected clots given her known upper extremity DVTs
   and/or for cardiac vegetations.  No evidence of septic emboli on lung
   CT yesterday.  Nasopharyngeal aspirate negative, induced sputum to be
   done today.
   - continue antibiotics, changed to improve CSF penetration
   - discuss with ID antibiotic coverage
   - discuss with oncology the possibility of an infected Ommaya
   - TTE to evaluate valves for vegetation
   - f/u CSF studies
   - induced sputum
   .
   #) ALL:  with recent recurrent CNS disease.   This hospitalization she
   was treated with intrathecal chemotherapy and DLI with resolution of
   CSF blasts as of [**2176-4-1**].    Her CSF picture currently
   - f/u cytology of spinal fluid
   - TTE today to evaluate for endocarditis
   - s/p IVIg yesterday
   - continue filgastrim
   - during neutropenic period, continue acyclovir, micafungin, nystatin
   (had past mucositis)
   - discuss with
   .
   #) increased LFTs:  appears to be shock liver
   - continue to monitor
   .
   #)  increased urin output:  concerning for DI in the setting of a
   possible intra-cranial process
   - check serum/urine osms
   .
   #) Coagulopathy:  concerning for DIC
   - follow DIC labs q4h today
   - transfuse blood and products PRN
   .
   #)  Hypoglycemia:  noted on morning labs, s/p
 amp d50.  Possibly
   secondary to insulin in TPN, which was stopped overnight.
   - follow FSBG
   - D5

   Code status:  full code (confirmed last night with her healthcare
   proxy)
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who has been admitted to the ICU. She presents with altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, and respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient's medical history includes recurrent infections, including a recent VRE bacteremia. 

The patient experienced an asystolic arrest, likely due to calcium channel blocker toxicity, and has had several episodes of tachyarrhythmia. She also has evidence of poor perfusion, with cool extremities and thready pulses. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and elevated liver enzymes. Blood cultures have been positive for VRE, but there are no recent positive cultures. The patient's CSF findings suggest infection seeding, and there is a concern for contaminated Ommaya reservoir. 

Radiology shows a left upper lobe consolidation with recurrent infection in a region of focal bronchiectasis, small left and tiny right pleural effusions, scattered tree-in-bud opacities, and extensive chest wall and mediastinal collateral vascularization.

The patient is on multiple antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, daptomycin, and meropenem. She is also receiving IVIg and filgastrim.

The patient has several potential medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, fever"

   #) ALL:  with recent recurrent CNS disease.   Her hospital course thus
   far has been characterized by:
   The patient was found to have recurrent bone marrow as well as CNS
   disease after presenting with dizziness. After C/T/L spine imaging, the
   patient's CSF was sampled and she was given IT MTX through an Ommaya
   biweekly for 2 weeks after her CSF cleared on [**2176-4-1**].  The was then
   treated on a weekly basis starting on XXXX.  The patient was unable to
   tolerate AraC due to severe nausea and vomiting. After one treatment
   with Ara-C, the patient instead recevied intra-thecal methotrexate
   approximately twice per week. Her CSF remained positive for blasts
   until tap on [**2176-4-1**].  She also received a cycle of HyperCVAD. She
   received part A as well as dexamethasone on D11-14 but vincristine was
   not given on D11 due to poor ostomy output and concern for further
   ileus. Peripheral blood smears showed resolution of peripheral blasts
   after 1-2 days of systemic chemotherapy. Her course was complicated by
   mucositis, poorly healing aphthous ulcers and poor po intake secondary
   to pain, which complicated healing and cause electrolyte abnormalities
   requiring significant repletion.  She was changed from oral pain
   medication to a low dose morphine PCA with good effect. She was also
   started on TPN for nutrition and her electrolytes abnormalities
   resolved.

   WORSENING FUNCTIONAL STATUS
   Likely secondary to worsening bacteremia. She has been on daptomycin as
   well as micafungin and meropenem. She has not been growing VRE
   recently, but it is possible that she is continuing to have
   complications of VRE through dapto. Gentamicin was added shortly before
   her transfer. Lisinopril was d/c

   decline in BP is masked somewhat by d/c

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and recent Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She presents with acute-on-chronic poor medical status, characterized by increasing tachypnea, tachycardia, and fever. The patient has been experiencing multiple complications, including respiratory failure requiring intubation, fevers with negative nasopharyngeal aspirate but positive CSF findings suggesting infection seeding, and recurrent CNS disease. She has also had mucositis, poorly healing aphthous ulcers, electrolyte abnormalities, and a history of allergic reactions to medications such as penicillins, latex, and red dye.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure, indicating severe lung dysfunction. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation are necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has ongoing fevers despite antibiotic therapy, suggesting a possible bacterial or fungal infection. Further evaluation with cultures and imaging studies is required to identify the source of infection. The CSF findings are concerning for infection seeding, and the patient may require additional or different antibiotics to achieve resolution.
3. ALL and Recurrent CNS Disease: The patient's ALL has recurred with recent CNS involvement. Frequent monitoring of blood counts and evaluation of the CSF for blasts are essential. Treatment modifications, such as changing from systemic chemotherapy to intra-thecal meth"

   This is a 60 year old woman with ALL and recent VRE bacteremia who
   comes with acute-on-chronic poor medical status, with increasing
   tachypnea, tachycardia, and temperature.
   #) s/p asystolic arrest:  Likely cause was toxicity from calcium
   channel blockade.  Her tachyarthymia may have been secondary to
   sympathetic output from fevers in the setting of a heart compromised by
   prior anthracycline toxicity.  Currently her pupils are reactive and
   she responds to stimulation.
   - monitor electrolytes q6h and replete PRN
   - trend lactate
   - no further nodal agents
   - head CT to evaluate for severe neurologic damage
   .
   #) respiratory failure:  intubated in the peri-code setting.  ABGs
   during the day yesterday indicated primary metabolic alkalosis.
   Possibilities for etiology include intracranial process, drug effect,
   PE.  Could not evaluate for PE yesterday because of reported allergy to
   contrast (patient was unable to define further.)  No obvious drug
   offenders on her list.
   - CT head to evaluate for intracranial process
   - LENIs to evaluate for source of PE
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   #) hypotension:  blood pressures were very labile prior to the code.
   She is currently requiring a small dose of neo.
   - wean neo as tolerated
   .
   #) fevers:  On ciprofloxacin+dapto+meropenem.  Recent cultures with VRE
   but none since [**4-11**]. CSF findings concerning for infection seeding her
   CSF.  It is possible that her Ommaya is confaminated.  Also would be
   concerned for infected clots given her known upper extremity DVTs
   and/or for cardiac vegetations.  No evidence of septic emboli on lung
   CT yesterday.  Nasopharyngeal aspirate negative, induced sputum to be
   done today.
   - continue antibiotics, changed to improve CSF penetration
   - discuss with ID antibiotic coverage
   - discuss with oncology the possibility of an infected Ommaya
   - TTE to evaluate valves for vegetation
   - f/u CSF studies
   - induced sputum

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who is currently in critical condition in the ICU. She has been experiencing tachypnea, tachycardia, and fever, and has had multiple medical complications including septic arrest, respiratory failure, hypotension, and increased liver enzymes. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. She also has an Ommaya shunt, which has been tapped due to leukocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia and there are concerns about possible infections in the CSF, port contamination, and infected clots. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and further evaluation is needed for the source of infection.
2. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of cardiotoxicity related to chemotherapy and may have cardiac vegetations or endocarditis, which needs to be evaluated with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE).
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is concern for possible pneumonia or pulmonary embolism contributing to her respiratory alkalosis.
4. Neurological issues: The patient has had altered mental status, and further evaluation is needed with a head CT to assess for intracranial processes such as central nervous system (CNS) involvement or diabetic insip"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   CNS involvement by ALL as well as by enterococcus in association with
   the Omaya port, and SDH of chronic appearance seen on head CT s/p
   cardiac arrest, now s/p neurosurgical procedure as above. In
   retrospect, the subdural hematoma and gram-positive (likely
   enterococcal) infection may have been responsible for a considerable
   portion of what was described on her prior arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] as
poor
   functional status
a vague worsening of cognition and function
   consistent with a diffuse cerebral process. Neurological exam currently
   showing promptly reactive pupils and some retreat of feet to noxious
   stimuli, but otherwise non-responsive in setting of sedation on vent.
   Assessment of neuro status confounded somewhat by her cardiac arrest,
   which may have created some anoxic brain injury.
   -          follow up neurosurgical recommendations
   -          continue to follow neurological exam
   -          titrate down sedation as tolerated, continue to evaluate
   mental status closely in this setting
   -          follow up CNS cultures, culture from Omaya device
   -          continue antibiotics as detailed below.
   -          Discuss w BMT service whether there are criteria that would
   allow return to treatment of CNS disease; may simply require ongoing
   assessment of relative risks and benefits in context
   [**Name (NI) 6041**] INFECTION, c/w VRE
   Per ID recommendations, linezolid superior to daptomycin for coverage
   of CNS infection. Has the unfortunate advantage of suppressing bone
   marrow in immune-compromised patient. Immediate treatment of infection
   is current priority. Should continue to weigh risks and benefits of
   anti-VRE abx choice.
   -          continue linezolid with gentamicin
   ALL
   Lengthy history with ALL, now recurring. S/p donor lymphocyte infusion.
   Giving G-CSF. Will need treatment for CNS disease at some point.
   -          follow up BMT recommendations
   -          has extensive medications for symptomatic treatment of
   mucositis and esophagitis; continue for now but continue to evaluate
   oral health, consider d/c
ing in setting of ventilation

","Ms. [**Known lastname 5996**] is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who presented to the ICU for further care and follow-up. She has a recurrence of ALL, including CNS involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. She underwent cardiac arrest, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH). 

Upon her return to the ICU, she was found to have altered mental status, CNS involvement by ALL as well as by enterococcus in association with the Omaya port, and chronic SDH. She underwent a neurosurgical procedure to remove the port and evacuate the SDH. 

Her current condition includes severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 20%) and mild mitral regurgitation. She also has a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. 

She is currently on multiple antibiotics, including linezolid for VRE infection, which has the advantage of covering CNS infection but may suppress bone marrow in an immune-compromised patient. 

Her lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lactate levels. 

Her assessment and plan include follow-up neurosurgical recommendations, continued evaluation of neurological status, titration down of sedation as tolerated, and discussion with the BMT service"

1. Enterococcal infection: The patient has a history of enterococcal infection associated with the Omaya port. This infection may lead to sepsis and systemic complications.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient had a cardiac arrest, which indicates a potential risk for future cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Neurological complications: The patient has a history of ALL with CNS involvement and underwent evacuation of a subdural hematoma. There is a risk of ongoing neurological dysfunction or new neurological events.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and other respiratory infections.
5. Thrombotic complications: The patient may be at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and underlying malignancy.
6. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient may be at risk"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.  Currently off all sedation, with reactive pupils but not
   following commands.  CSF drawn off of Omaya with gram positive cocci,
   likely VRE that seeded from her blood.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam changes
   - f/u neurosurgery recommnendation regarding management of SDH
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as below
   .
   # VRE:  Previously in blood, none since [**4-11**], but now likely VRE in
   CSF.  Omaya port, the likely source, has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - check gent levels and dose accordingly
   .
   # ALL:  s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need
   further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - continue filgastrim
   - follow ANC
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   currently with primary metabolic alkalosis and  over-breathing the
   ventilator.  Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing
   infection, recent surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs
   negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.
   - no change in ventilator management right now given other acute issues
   .
   # FEVERS:  afebrile since her evacuation procedure.  Her WBC count is
   improving, although many immature/atypical forms.  On linezolid,
   meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, and acyclovir.
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly
   be at plateau earlier today. Follow closely.
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:
   Thought to be immediately associated with increase in calcium channel
   blocker dose; this was in response to tachyarrythmia in setting of
   infection. Recent echo shows ongoing cardiac compromise, worsened EF
   compared to earlier in this admission. Difficult to tell at this point
   whether this is a feature of the acute setting of infection and s/p
   arrest, vs an earlier decline that predisposed her to arrest.
   -          follow up echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   -          avoid nodal agents
   -          replete lytes closely
   -          no longer requiring pressors

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and previous successful treatment. She has now experienced recurrence of leukemia including CNS involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. The patient underwent cardiac arrest, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH). She has been admitted to the ICU for further care and follow-up by both the ICU team and the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, and possible recurrent CNS lymphoma. She is currently off all sedation with reactive pupils but not following commands. CSF drawn from the Omaya showed gram-positive cocci, likely vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) that seeded from her blood.

2. VRE infection: The patient had previous VRE in her blood and now has likely VRE in the CSF. The Omaya port, the likely source, has been removed. Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration, although linezolid will cause bone marrow suppression. Gentamicin is being used for synergy. Cultures and sensitivities should be monitored, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) when stable should"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.  Currently off all sedation, with reactive pupils but not
   following commands.  CSF drawn off of Omaya with gram positive cocci,
   likely VRE that seeded from her blood.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam changes
   - f/u neurosurgery recommnendation regarding management of SDH
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as below
   .
   # VRE:  Previously in blood, none since [**4-11**], but now likely VRE in
   CSF.  Omaya port, the likely source, has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - check gent levels and dose accordingly
   .
   # ALL:  s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need
   further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - continue filgastrim
   - follow ANC
   .
   # RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS:  intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   currently with primary metabolic alkalosis and  over-breathing the
   ventilator.  Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing
   infection, recent surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs
   negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  Concern for the risk
   of seizure with alkalemia.   BP is not tolerating increased sedation to
   deal with this.
   - plan to give small boluses of sedation rather than gtt to attempt to
   control hyperventilation
   .
   # FEVERS:  afebrile since her evacuation procedure.  Her WBC count is
   improving, although many immature/atypical forms.  On linezolid,
   meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, and acyclovir.
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly
   be at plateau earlier today. Follow closely.
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  likely was secondary to CCB in the setting of
   a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.  No longer requiring
   pressors.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and previous successful treatment, now with recurrence including CNS involvement. She has undergone cardiac arrest, removal of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy, and evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH). She is currently in the ICU for further care and follow-up by the BMT (bone marrow transplant) team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, likely due to a combination of factors including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, and possible recurrent CNS lymphoma.
2. VRE (Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci) infection: The patient has likely VRE in her CSF (cerebrospinal fluid), which may have originated from her blood. The Omaya port, a potential source of infection, has been removed. She is being treated with linezolid and gentamicin to target the VRE infection.
3. Endocarditis: Given the new finding of VRE in the CSF and previous negative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), there is a suspicion for endocarditis. Further evaluation with TEE when stable is recommended to rule out vegetation.
4. Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient is over-breathing the ventilator, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This may be caused by an intracran"

   Assessment and Plan
 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.  Currently off all sedation, with reactive pupils but not
   following commands.  CSF drawn off of Omaya with gram positive cocci,
   likely VRE that seeded from her blood.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam changes
   - f/u neurosurgery recommnendation regarding management of SDH
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as below
   .
   # VRE:  Previously in blood, none since [**4-11**], but now likely VRE in
   CSF.  Omaya port, the likely source, has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - check gent levels and dose accordingly
   .
   # ALL:  s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need
   further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - continue filgastrim
   - follow ANC
   .
   # RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS:  intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   currently with primary metabolic alkalosis and  over-breathing the
   ventilator.  Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing
   infection, recent surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs
   negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  Concern for the risk
   of seizure with alkalemia.   BP is not tolerating increased sedation to
   deal with this.
   - plan to give small boluses of sedation rather than gtt to attempt to
   control hyperventilation
   .
   # FEVERS:  afebrile since her evacuation procedure.  Her WBC count is
   improving, although many immature/atypical forms.  On linezolid,
   meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, and acyclovir.
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly
   be at plateau earlier today. Follow closely.
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  likely was secondary to CCB in the setting of
   a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.  No longer requiring
   pressors.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium

","The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of leukemia, specifically acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and a recent recurrence of the disease including central nervous system (CNS) involvement. She also has a likely enterococcal infection in her Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. The patient experienced cardiac arrest and had the Omaya port removed, as well as evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH). She is currently in the ICU for further care and follow-up by both the ICU team and the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered mental status: This is likely multifactorial, including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, and possible recurrent CNS lymphoma. The patient's pupils are reactive, but she is not following commands.

2. Vancomycin-resistant enterococcal (VRE) infection: The patient previously had VRE in her blood, and now there is evidence of VRE in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The likely source of infection is the removed Omaya port. She is being treated with linezolid for better CSF penetration, although it may cause bone marrow suppression, and gentamicin for synergy. There is a suspicion of endocarditis, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) will be performed when the patient is stable to rule out vegetation.

 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS
   CNS involvement by ALL as well as by enterococcus in association with
   the Omaya port, and SDH of chronic appearance seen on head CT s/p
   cardiac arrest, now s/p neurosurgical procedure as above. In
   retrospect, the subdural hematoma and gram-positive (likely
   enterococcal) infection may have been responsible for a considerable
   portion of what was described on her prior arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] as
poor
   functional status
a vague worsening of cognition and function
   consistent with a diffuse cerebral process. Neurological exam currently
   showing promptly reactive pupils and some retreat of feet to noxious
   stimuli, but otherwise non-responsive in setting of sedation on vent.
   Assessment of neuro status confounded somewhat by her cardiac arrest,
   which may have created some anoxic brain injury.
   -          follow up neurosurgical recommendations
   -          continue to follow neurological exam
   -          titrate down sedation as tolerated, continue to evaluate
   mental status closely in this setting
   -          follow up CNS cultures, culture from Omaya device
   -          continue antibiotics as detailed below; current increase in
   neutrophils may allow sooner d/c of these
   -          Discuss w BMT service whether there are criteria that would
   allow return to treatment of CNS disease; may simply require ongoing
   assessment of relative risks and benefits in context
   # GRAM-POSITIVE INFECTION, c/w VRE
   Per ID recommendations, linezolid superior to daptomycin for coverage
   of CNS infection. Has the unfortunate advantage of suppressing bone
   marrow in immune-compromised patient. Immediate treatment of infection
   is current priority. Should continue to weigh risks and benefits of
   anti-VRE abx choice.
   -          continue linezolid with gentamicin
   # ALL
   Lengthy history with ALL, now recurring. S/p donor lymphocyte infusion.
   Giving G-CSF. Will need treatment for CNS disease at some point.
   -          follow up BMT recommendations
   -          has extensive medications for symptomatic treatment of
   mucositis and esophagitis; continue for now but continue to evaluate
   oral health, consider d/c
ing in setting of ventilation
   -          continue filgrastim
   -          follow ANC, appears to be normalizing by CBC/diff
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST
   Thought to be immediately associated with increase in calcium channel
   blocker dose; this was in response to tachyarrythmia in setting of
   infection. Recent echo shows ongoing cardiac compromise, worsened EF
   compared to earlier in this admission. Difficult to tell at this point
   whether this is a feature of the acute setting of infection and s/p
   arrest, vs an earlier decline that predisposed her to arrest.
   -          follow up echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   -          avoid nodal agents
   -          replete lytes closely
   -          no longer requiring pressors
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
   Originally intubated in setting of cardiac arrest; kept on vent since
   then. ABGs have suggested metabolic alkalosis. LENIs negative for DVT;
   PE-CT unable to perform because of reported CT contrast allergy.
   Currently on AC settings. Getting ABG to evaluate current status.
   - wean FiO2 and PEEP as tolerated
   .
   FEVERS
   Afebrile post-op. On vanc, linezolid, meropenem, gentamicin,
   micafungin, and acyclovir. This should ensure the death of most of the
   microbial universe. As above, changed to linezolid to cover CNS VRE.
   Following up cultures, etc.
   -          heartening to see increase in WBC, neuts, bands.
   -          Continue filgrastim
   -          Continue abx as above
   ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly
   be at plateau earlier today. Follow closely.
   In summary, this is a 60 year old woman with ALL and a difficult
   hospital course s/p DLI, with apparently resolving neutropenia but now
   s/p craniotomy, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and shock liver.
   Currently stable on the vent; hope for improvement with improvement in
   WBC, antibiotics, removal of CNS source of infection. Following cardiac
   and liver function to evaluate for recovery s/p arrest.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) who is currently experiencing altered mental status. She underwent neurosurgical intervention and has had several complications including a cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, and shock liver. The patient's medical team is concerned about potential medical complications such as gram-positive infection (likely enterococcal), CNS involvement by ALL, and ongoing cardiac compromise.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Gram-Positive Infection: The patient has shown signs of a gram-positive infection, likely enterococcal, which may have been responsible for her previous cardiac arrest and subdural hematoma. Antibiotics have been prescribed to treat this infection.

2. CNS Involvement by ALL: The patient's ALL has recurred and involved the central nervous system (CNS). Treatment for CNS disease will be necessary at some point.

3. Ongoing Cardiac Compromise: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest and has ongoing cardiac compromise, as indicated by a recent echo showing a worsened ejection fraction (EF) compared to earlier in the admission. Further evaluation and management are required to address this issue.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient was originally intubated due to cardiac arrest and has been kept on mechanical ventilation since then. There are concerns about weaning her off the ventilator and managing respiratory failure.

5. Elevated Liver Enzymes: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, consistent with"

 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that Likely multifactorial
   including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection,
   possible recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Currently off all sedation, with
   reactive pupils but not following commands.  CSF drawn off of Omaya
   with gram positive cocci, likely VRE that seeded from her blood.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam changes
   - f/u neurosurgery recommnendation regarding management of SDH
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as below
   .
   # VRE:  Previously in blood, none since [**4-11**], but now enterococcus in
   CSF, presumably the same bacteria.  Omaya port, the likely source, has
   now been removed.    Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better
   CSF penetration, although linezolid will cause BM suppression.
   Gentamicin for synergy.  TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but
   given new finding of likely VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for
   endocarditis.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - gentamicin dose changed per BMT recs:  will check level after 3^rd
   dose
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - check gent levels and dose accordingly
   - may d/c meropenem now that low suspicion for any GNR process
   .
   # ALL:  Most likely cause of her bump in WBC today is recovery of BM.
   She is s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need
   further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - now off ilgastrim
   - follow ANC
   .
   # RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS:  intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   currently with primary metabolic alkalosis and  over-breathing the
   ventilator.  Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing
   infection, recent surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs
   negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  Concern for the risk
   of seizure with alkalemia.   BP is not tolerating increased sedation to
   deal with this.
   - plan to give small boluses of sedation rather than gtt to attempt to
   control hyperventilation
   .
   # FEVERS:  afebrile since her evacuation procedure.  Her WBC count is
   improving, although many immature/atypical forms.  On linezolid,
   meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, and acyclovir.
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly
   be at plateau earlier today. Follow closely.
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  likely was secondary to CCB in the setting of
   a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.  No longer requiring
   pressors.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium

   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that Likely multifactorial
   including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection,
   possible recurrent CNS lymphoma.  Currently off all sedation, with
   reactive pupils but not following commands.  CSF drawn off of Omaya
   with gram positive cocci, likely VRE that seeded from her blood.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam changes
   - f/u neurosurgery recommnendation regarding management of SDH
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as below
   .
   # VRE:  Previously in blood, none since [**4-11**], but now enterococcus in
   CSF, presumably the same bacteria.  Omaya port, the likely source, has
   now been removed.    Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better
   CSF penetration, although linezolid will cause BM suppression.
   Gentamicin for synergy.  TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but
   given new finding of likely VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for
   endocarditis.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - gentamicin dose changed per BMT recs:  will check level after 3^rd
   dose
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - check gent levels and dose accordingly

   # RESPIRATORY ALKALOSIS:  intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   currently with primary metabolic alkalosis and  over-breathing the

   infection, recent surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs
   negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  Concern for the risk
   of seizure with alkalemia.   BP is not tolerating increased sedation to
   deal with this.
   - plan to give small boluses of sedation rather than gtt to attempt to
   control hyperventilation
   .

   improving, although many immature/atypical forms.  On linezolid,
   meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, and acyclovir.

   downtrending.
   Consistent in time and magnitude with shock liver. Appear to possibly

   a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.  No longer requiring
   pressors.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL and past successful treatment, now with recurrence including CNS involvement. She underwent cardiac arrest, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of SDH. The patient is currently in the ICU for further care and follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, inability to protect airway, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, respiratory alkalosis, and elevated liver enzymes. She is off all sedation, with reactive pupils but not following commands. CSF drawn off of Omaya with gram-positive cocci, likely VRE, was found. The patient's Omaya port has been removed, and she is on linezolid, gentamicin, and micafungin.

The patient's previous issues include suspected endocarditis, GNR process, respiratory alkalosis, and sepsis. She has received intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission. The cause of her bump in WBC today is likely the recovery of BM. The patient is s/p intrathecal MTX and DLI this admission. Further treatment for CNS lymphoma is planned in the future.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is likely multifactorial, including recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, and possible recurrent CNS lymphoma.
2. Impaired Skin Integrity"

   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now enterococcus in
   CSF, presumably the same bacteria.  Omaya port which was seeded has now
   been removed.    Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF
   penetration, although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin
   for synergy.  TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new
   finding of likely VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
   Would need 8 weeks of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS
   infection s/p source removal.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - after discussion with ID and high trough, gentamicin dose decreased:
   will check level after 4th dose tomorrow PM
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - d/c meropenem now that low suspicion for any GNR process
   # HYPOTENSION:  New this morning, SBP 80s, did not respond to 750 cc
   bolus so far.  Lactate also elevated, likely secondary to poor
   perfusion.  Differential includes sepsis, and her new leukocytosis
   would go along with this (although she is  not neutropenic, on very
   broad abx coverage, and blood cx repeatedly negative).  Also on the
   differential are cardiogenic shock (EF recently 20% in the post-arrest
   period), volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency, CNS etiology, PE (but
   not hypoxic nor impressively more tachycardic).  Limbs are warm, neck
   veins difficult to assess, and there is some question about the
   accuracy of art line BP [**Location (un) 103**].  Regarding management, would prefer to
   give a pressor with inotropic activity such as levophed if needed.
   - check BP in all 4 limbs
   - assess neck veins
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - Infectious work-up:  repeat blood and urine cx, sputum cx, stool for
   c diff, monitor line for signs of infection
   - IVNS x 500 cc bolus now
   - consider Levophed if persistently hypotensive despite fluid boluses
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that she now withdraws to
   stimulation.  However, off sedation she is not alert or following
   commands.  This is likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam deteriorates
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as
   below.
   .
   # ALL:  Most likely cause of her bump in WBC today is recovery of BM.
   Currently day +40 s/p hyper-CVAD.  She is also s/p intrathecal MTX and
   DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need further treatment for CNS
   lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - now off filgastrim
   - follow CBC/diff
   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.
   - discuss whether the fungal and viral coverage is still needed with
   BMT and ID
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   with ongoing primary metabolic alkalosis.  Cause is most likely
   intracranial process (ongoing infection, recent surgery).  PE was on
   the differential but LENIs negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast
   allergy.  There is some concern for the risk of seizure with alkalemia,
   but we are not able to give opiates to depress her respiratory drive
   because of hypotension.  Regarding her ventilated status, her
   neurologic exam is currently not such that she could protect her airway
   if extubated
   -continue mechanical ventilation at current settings for now
   - consider SBT if mental status improves.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to counts recovering after
   chemo (many immature forms), however very sharp bump today is also
   concerning for an infectious etiology.   She has been afebrile since
   her evacuation procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.  Will
   work-up for infectious cause as above.
   .
   # RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.  After discussion with ID,
   meropenem is a likely culprit. Although it has been on for a month, it
   is possible to develop a new rash after this time.  Would also be
   concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently
   started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
   - stop meropenem, no longer  indicated anyway as above
   - follow clinically
   - would discuss if alternative antibiotic regimen could be constructed
   if rash persists/worsens and linezolid is possibly implicated
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.  INR climbing, which may be secondary to synthetic
   dysfunction after hepatic injury.
   - continue to monitor LFTs and INR
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  likely was secondary to CCB in the setting of
   a heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY:  per discussion with nursing, patient is bleeding from
   lines.  INR slightly elevated and climbing.  Concern for DIC in this
   woman with cancer and ongoing infection.
   - check now and  follow serial DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and past successful treatment. She now presents with recurrence of ALL, including central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. The patient has undergone cardiac arrest, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH). She is currently in the ICU for further care and follow-up by the ICU team and the bone marrow transplant (BMT) team.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has new-onset hypotension with a blood pressure in the 80s. This could be due to sepsis, cardiogenic shock, volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency, CNS etiology, or pulmonary embolism (PE). The differential includes these possibilities, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has improved from a previous state of not following commands but still does not have an alert mental status. Possible causes include recent SDH, prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, or recurrent CNS lymphoma. Neurological examination should be followed, and imaging may be necessary if the condition deteriorates.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has a sharp increase in white blood cell count, which could be due to recovering bone marrow or an infectious etiology."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has a history of leukemia, altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, impaired skin integrity, and an inability to protect the airway. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

24-hour events include obtaining blood cultures, sputum culture, and urine culture. The patient experienced hypotension during the afternoon requiring norepinephrine, which was used intermittently. The patient also received multiple antibiotics including meropenem, micafungin, gentamicin, linezolid, and acyclovir.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature at 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate at 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/73 mmHg to 89/47 mmHg, respiratory rate at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97% on supplemental oxygen.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 5,499 mL with an output of 1,358 mL, resulting in a balance of 4,141 mL.

Respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 450 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The patient's arterial blood gas (AB"

   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past

   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest & intubated since, s/p
   removal of the Omaya port and evacuation of SDH.
   # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now with VRE (amp R,
   linezolid S)  in CSF, presumably the same bacteria which was in the
   blood previously.  Omaya port which was seeded has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, but sensitivity clearly less than TEE.  Would need 8 weeks
   of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS infection s/p source
   removal.
   - continue linezolid (D1=[**4-16**]) and gentamicin (D1=[**4-15**])
   - after discussion with ID and high trough, gentamicin dose decreased
   TO Q 24
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation to determine lenghth of TX
   - meropenem d/c
ed ([**4-18**]) now that low suspicion for any GNR process
   - d/w micro re: additional sensitivities: tigacycline?
   # HYPOTENSION:  New on [**4-18**],  did not respond to bolus and required
   levophed until this morning.  Lactate also elevated, likely secondary
   to poor perfusion.  Differential includes sepsis, and her new
   leukocytosis would go along with this (although ID feels that this is
   more likely [**1-1**] G-CSF and blood cx repeatedly negative).  Also on the
   differential are cardiogenic shock (EF recently 20% in the post-arrest
   period), volume depletion, CNS etiology. Adreanl insufficeincy r/o by
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim. Limbs are warm, neck veins difficult to assess, and there is
   some question about the accuracy of art line BP [**Location (un) 103**].
   - monitor BP of pressors, low threshold to resume levophed to maintain
   MAP > 65
   - trend lactate
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that she now withdraws to
   stimulation.  This is likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam deteriorates; per neuro no role curretly
   for repeat LP
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as
   below.
   .
   # ALL:  Currently day +40 s/p hyper-CVAD.  She is also s/p intrathecal
   MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need further treatment for
   CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - now off filgastrim
   - follow CBC/diff
   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing infection, recent
   surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs negative; unable to do
   CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  There is some concern for the risk of
   seizure with alkalemia, but we are not able to give opiates to depress
   her respiratory drive because of hypotension.  Previously mental status
   has been major boundary to extubation, but improvement today permits
   SBT
   - SBT with possible extubation
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to counts recovering after
   chemo (many immature forms) and GCSF, however very CONTINUED bump today
   to 30 is also concerning.   She has been afebrile since her evacuation
   procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.  Will work-up for
   infectious cause as above.
   .
   # RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.  After discussion with ID,
   meropenem is a likely culprit. Although it has been on for a month, it
   is possible to develop a new rash after this time.  Would also be
   concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently
   started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
   - monitor rash now off meropenem
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   - continue to monitor LFTs and INR
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  temporally realted to CCB in the setting of a
   heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY:  per discussion with nursing, patient is bleeding from
   lines.  INR slightly elevated.  Some concern for DIC in this woman with
   cancer and ongoing infection.
   - check now and  follow serial DIC labs

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL and past successful treatment. She has now experienced recurrence, including CNS involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. She underwent cardiac arrest, intubation, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of subdural hematoma (SDH).

She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, hypotension, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, rash, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. The patient's current medications include linezolid, gentamicin, pantoprazole, and others. She is receiving broad-spectrum antimicrobial coverage including acyclovir and micafungin. She is also scheduled for further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. Imaging reveals an endotracheal tube projecting 2 cm above the carina, improvement in pulmonary edema, cardiac size within normal limits, and bilateral atelectases.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension, elevated lactate levels, and leukocytosis suggest ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs, cultures, and sensitivities is necessary.

2. Hypotension: The patient's new-on"

   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest, s/p removal of the
   Omaya port and evacuation of SDH; now returned to the [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for further
   care and continued follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
   # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now enterococcus in
   CSF, presumably the same bacteria.  Omaya port which was seeded has now
   been removed.    Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF
   penetration, although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin
   for synergy.  TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new
   finding of likely VRE in CSF, suspicion is high for endocarditis.
   Would need 8 weeks of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS
   infection s/p source removal.
   - continue linezolid and gentamicin
   - after discussion with ID and high trough, gentamicin dose decreased:
   will check level after 4th dose tomorrow PM
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation
   - d/c meropenem now that low suspicion for any GNR process
   # HYPOTENSION:  New this morning, SBP 80s, did not respond to 750 cc
   bolus so far.  Lactate also elevated, likely secondary to poor
   perfusion.  Differential includes sepsis, and her new leukocytosis
   would go along with this (although she is  not neutropenic, on very
   broad abx coverage, and blood cx repeatedly negative).  Also on the
   differential are cardiogenic shock (EF recently 20% in the post-arrest
   period), volume depletion, adrenal insufficiency, CNS etiology, PE (but
   not hypoxic nor impressively more tachycardic).  Limbs are warm, neck
   veins difficult to assess, and there is some question about the
   accuracy of art line BP [**Location (un) 103**].  Regarding management, would prefer to
   give a pressor with inotropic activity such as levophed if needed.
   - check BP in all 4 limbs
   - assess neck veins
   - trend lactate
   - [**Last Name (un) **] stim
   - Infectious work-up:  repeat blood and urine cx, sputum cx, stool for
   c diff, monitor line for signs of infection
   - IVNS x 500 cc bolus now
   - consider Levophed if persistently hypotensive despite fluid boluses
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that she now withdraws to
   stimulation.  However, off sedation she is not alert or following
   commands.  This is likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam deteriorates
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as
   below.
   .
   # ALL:  Most likely cause of her bump in WBC today is recovery of BM.
   Currently day +40 s/p hyper-CVAD.  She is also s/p intrathecal MTX and
   DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need further treatment for CNS
   lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - now off filgastrim
   - follow CBC/diff
   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.
   - discuss whether the fungal and viral coverage is still needed with
   BMT and ID
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest,
   with ongoing primary metabolic alkalosis.  Cause is most likely
   intracranial process (ongoing infection, recent surgery).  PE was on
   the differential but LENIs negative; unable to do CTA [**1-1**] contrast
   allergy.  There is some concern for the risk of seizure with alkalemia,
   but we are not able to give opiates to depress her respiratory drive
   because of hypotension.  Regarding her ventilated status, her
   neurologic exam is currently not such that she could protect her airway
   if extubated
   -continue mechanical ventilation at current settings for now
   - consider SBT if mental status improves.
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to counts recovering after
   chemo (many immature forms), however very sharp bump today is also
   concerning for an infectious etiology.   She has been afebrile since
   her evacuation procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.  Will
   work-up for infectious cause as above.
   .
   # RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.  After discussion with ID,
   meropenem is a likely culprit. Although it has been on for a month, it
   is possible to develop a new rash after this time.  Would also be
   concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently
   started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
   - stop meropenem, no longer  indicated anyway as above
   - follow clinically
   - would discuss if alternative antibiotic regimen could be constructed

","Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL and past successful treatment, now with recurrence including CNS involvement.
- She has had a cardiac arrest, removal of the Omaya port, and evacuation of SDH.
- She is currently in the ICU for further care and follow-up by both the ICU team and the BMT team.
- She has multiple medical complications including sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension, altered mental status, respiratory failure, leukocytosis, rash, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy.
- She is on broad-spectrum antibiotics including acyclovir, micafungin, linezolid, and gentamicin.
- She has ongoing infections, including enterococcal infection in the CSF, and there is suspicion of endocarditis.
- She is also being treated for ALL and has received intrathecal MTX and DLI.
- Her current vital signs are stable, but she requires mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk for sepsis due to her compromised immune system and ongoing infections.
2. Endocarditis: Given the new finding of VRE in the CSF and the suspicion of endocarditis, the patient is at risk for complications related to infective endocarditis.
3. Organ Dysfunction: Although currently without organ dysfunction, the patient's sepsis and other underlying conditions may lead to organ dysfunction"

 .H/O LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM)
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
   This is a 60 year old woman with a lengthy history of ALL and past
   successful treatment of this, now with recurrence including CNS
   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest & intubated since, s/p
   removal of the Omaya port and evacuation of SDH.
   # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now with VRE (amp R,
   linezolid S)  in CSF, presumably the same bacteria which was in the
   blood previously.  Omaya port which was seeded has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, but sensitivity clearly less than TEE.  Would need 8 weeks
   of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS infection s/p source
   removal.
   - continue linezolid (D1=[**4-16**]) and gentamicin (D1=[**4-15**])
   - after discussion with ID and high trough, gentamicin dose decreased
   TO Q 24
   - f/u culture data and sensitivities
   - TEE when stable for r/o vegetation to determine lenghth of TX
   - meropenem d/c
ed ([**4-18**]) now that low suspicion for any GNR process
   - d/w micro re: additional sensitivities: tigacycline?
   # HYPOTENSION:  New on [**4-18**],  did not respond to bolus and required
   levophed until this morning.  Lactate also elevated, likely secondary
   to poor perfusion.  Differential includes sepsis, and her new
   leukocytosis would go along with this (although ID feels that this is
   more likely [**1-1**] G-CSF and blood cx repeatedly negative).  Also on the
   differential are cardiogenic shock (EF recently 20% in the post-arrest
   period), volume depletion, CNS etiology. Adreanl insufficeincy r/o by
   [**Last Name (un) **] stim. Limbs are warm, neck veins difficult to assess, and there is
   some question about the accuracy of art line BP [**Location (un) 103**].
   - monitor BP of pressors, low threshold to resume levophed to maintain
   MAP > 65
   - trend lactate
   # ALTERED MENTAL STATUS:  Improved today in that she now withdraws to
   stimulation.  This is likely multifactorial including recent SDH,
   prolonged asystolic arrest, CNS infection, possible recurrent CNS
   lymphoma.
   - follow neuro exam
   - would re-image head if exam deteriorates; per neuro no role curretly
   for repeat LP
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - f/u CNS cultures
   - discuss with BMT possible further treatment of CNS lymphoma, as
   below.
   .
   # ALL:  Currently day +40 s/p hyper-CVAD.  She is also s/p intrathecal
   MTX and DLI this admission.  Per BMT, will need further treatment for
   CNS lymphoma in the future.
   - f/u BMT recommendations
   - now off filgastrim
   - follow CBC/diff
   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing infection, recent
   surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs negative; unable to do
   CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  There is some concern for the risk of
   seizure with alkalemia, but we are not able to give opiates to depress
   her respiratory drive because of hypotension.  Previously mental status
   has been major boundary to extubation, but improvement today permits
   SBT
   - SBT with possible extubation
   .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to counts recovering after
   chemo (many immature forms) and GCSF, however very CONTINUED bump today
   to 30 is also concerning.   She has been afebrile since her evacuation
   procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.  Will work-up for
   infectious cause as above.
   .
   # RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.  After discussion with ID,
   meropenem is a likely culprit. Although it has been on for a month, it
   is possible to develop a new rash after this time.  Would also be
   concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently
   started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
   - monitor rash now off meropenem
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   - continue to monitor LFTs and INR
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  temporally realted to CCB in the setting of a
   heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY:  per discussion with nursing, patient is bleeding from
   lines.  INR slightly elevated.  Some concern for DIC in this woman with
   cancer and ongoing infection.
   - check now and  follow serial DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL, who is currently in the ICU due to sepsis without organ dysfunction. She has been intubated since a cardiac arrest and has undergone several interventions, including the removal of an Omaya port and evacuation of a subdural hematoma (SDH). She has developed VRE in her CNS and is being treated with linezolid and gentamicin. The patient's recent medical history includes hypotension, altered mental status, leukocytosis, respiratory failure, and an elevated liver enzyme level. She also has a rash that may be related to a drug allergy, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, airway compromise, impaired skin integrity, fever of unknown origin, and altered mental status. She is on multiple medications and has various lines and tubes in place. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. The main goal is to control the source of infection and manage the patient's vital signs and organ functions.
2. Airway compromise: The patient's airway is currently secured with mechanical ventilation through an endotracheal tube. There is a risk of airway obstruction or extub"

   involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used
   for intrathecal chemotherapy; s/p cardiac arrest & intubated since, s/p
   removal of the Omaya port and evacuation of SDH.
   # VRE in CNS:  Blood cx negative since [**4-11**], but now with VRE (amp R,
   linezolid S)  in CSF, presumably the same bacteria which was in the
   blood previously.  Omaya port which was seeded has now been removed.
   Daptomycin was switched to linezolid for better CSF penetration,
   although linezolid will cause BM suppression.  Gentamicin for synergy.
   TTE was negative for vegetation [**4-15**], but given new finding of likely
   VRE in CSF, but sensitivity clearly less than TEE.  Would need 8 weeks
   of abx if vegetation present vs 4 week if only CNS infection s/p source
   removal.
   - continue linezolid (D1=[**4-16**]) and gentamicin (D1=[**4-15**])
   - after discussion with ID and high trough, gentamicin dose decreased
   TO Q 24

   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:   Most likely secondary to GCSF.  No blasts or
   singificant lymphs to suggest recurrence of ALL.  There is also some
   suspicion for infection given recent hypotensive episode.  However, she
   has been afebrile since the procedure.  She is now off pressors and
   hemodynamically stable, and she has been afebrile since her evacuation
   procedure and is on very broad coverage as above.   C diff negative x

   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.

   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Intubated in the setting of cardiac arrest.
   Cause is most likely intracranial process (ongoing infection, recent
   surgery).  PE was on the differential but LENIs negative; unable to do
   CTA [**1-1**] contrast allergy.  There is some concern for the risk of
   seizure with alkalemia, but we are not able to give opiates to depress
   her respiratory drive because of hypotension.  Previously mental status
   has been major boundary to extubation, but improvement today permits
   SBT
   - SBT with possible extubation
   .
   .
   # RASH:  Concerning for a drug allergy.  After discussion with ID,
   meropenem is a likely culprit. Although it has been on for a month, it
   is possible to develop a new rash after this time.  Would also be
   concerned that linezolid could be contributing, since this was recently
   started, although this drug is much less likely to cause rash.
   - monitor rash now off meropenem
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending.
   - continue to monitor LFTs and INR
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  temporally realted to CCB in the setting of a
   heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY:  per discussion with nursing, patient is bleeding from
   lines.  INR slightly elevated.  Some concern for DIC in this woman with
   cancer and ongoing infection.
   - check now and  follow serial DIC labs

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of ALL, who presented with sepsis and was intubated. She has been treated for a possible enterococcal infection in the Omaya port and subsequent subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient's current conditions include sepsis without organ dysfunction, altered mental status, leukocytosis, hypotension, and respiratory failure. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and has shown improvement in her mental status. The patient is also being treated for leukemia recurrence and has a history of cardiac arrest. She is off pressors and hemodynamically stable. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Organ dysfunction: Despite the current absence of organ dysfunction, the patient's sepsis could progress to organ dysfunction if not appropriately managed.
3. Bleeding: The patient has a slightly elevated INR and is bleeding from lines, indicating a risk of coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications.
4. Respiratory issues: The patient's respiratory failure may persist or recur, particularly if extubation is attempted and she is unable to maintain adequate respiratory function.
5. CNS complications: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a combination of factors including CNS infection, recurrent CNS lymphoma, and recent SDH. There is a risk of worsening neurological"

   - continue broad-spectrum antimicrobial including acyclovir, micafungin
   in addition to linezolid/gent.
   - discuss with BMT stopping the acyclovir given that all viral cx
   negative
   .
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  Now extubated, oxygenating well on face tent
   and with improvement in respiratory alkalosis.
   Likely has some volume overload as seen on cxr but making good urine.
   - allow auto-diuresis, aim for net even to negative.
   .
   # RASH:  Appears improved today.  Concerning for a drug allergy.
   Meropenem was a possible culprit, now off for 3 days.  After discussion
   with ID, meropenem is a likely culprit.
   - monitor rash now off meropenem
   # ELEVATED LIVER ENZYMES:  consistent with shock liver.  Now
   downtrending except alk phos which remains elevated.  Tbili normal.
   - continue to monitor LFTs and INR
   .
   # S/P ASYSTOLIC ARREST:  temporally realted to CCB in the setting of a
   heart compromised by prior cardiotoxic chemotherapy.  Recent echo
   showed significant interval worsening of EF (40%-->20%) over the past 2
   weeks without any focal wall motion abnormalities.
   - repeat echo in [**3-4**] weeks
   - avoid nodal agents
   - replete lytes aggressively, with particular attention to calcium
   .
   # COAGULOPATHY:  per discussion with nursing, patient is bleeding from
   lines.  INR slightly elevated.  Low suspicion for DIC currently.
   .
   # ACCESS:  has clots in her upper extremity veins, access has been
   difficult.  Currently has femoral line.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), past successful treatment, recurrence including central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and likely enterococcal infection of an Omaya port used for intrathecal chemotherapy. She experienced a cardiac arrest and has been intubated since then. The Omaya port has been removed, and there is evidence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including linezolid and gentamicin, which were initiated based on the presence of VRE in the CSF. The patient's mental status has improved, and she is extubated with improved respiratory function. She is hemodynamically stable and off pressors. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has signs of infection, including fever, leukocytosis, and altered mental status. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected enterococcal infection, including VRE in the CSF.
2. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient had difficulty protecting her airway while intubated but is now extubated and oxygenating well on a face tent.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has a maculopapular erythematous rash on her back, which appears to be improving. It"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, who underwent an Omaya removal due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) contamination and also had a subdural hematoma evacuation. She is currently awake and extubated, afebrile, and her white blood cell count is decreasing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS VRE: The patient is being treated with linezolid for greater CNS penetration, despite the risk of CNS penetration. No transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been performed.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocytosis may be due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), culture-negative bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, or ALL. The cause is unclear, and further investigation is needed.
3. ALL: The patient is currently on day +43 of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy and has received intrathecal methotrexate and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) this admission. She will require further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future.
4. Drug Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, which appears improved today. It is believed to be caused by meropenem.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old woman with recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement who underwent an Omaya removal due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) contamination and subsequent subdural hematoma evacuation. She is currently awake and extubated, afebrile, and her white blood cell count is trending downward.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. CNS VRE: The patient has a history of VRE infection, for which she is being treated with linezolid for better CNS penetration. The duration of treatment will be approximately 4-8 weeks. Monitoring culture data and sensitivities is essential to assess the effectiveness of the antibiotic therapy.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's elevated white blood cell count may be due to factors such as growth factor therapy, culture-negative bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, or her underlying ALL. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of leukocytosis and guide appropriate management.

3. ALL: The patient is currently on day +43 of hyper-CVAD chemotherapy regimen and has received intrathecal methotrexate and donor lymphocyte infusion during this admission. She will require further treatment for CNS lymphoma in the future. Close follow-up with the bone marrow transplant team is necessary to discuss further treatment options.

","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaint is not specified. However, there have been several notable events in the past 24 hours, including the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT) and starting total parenteral nutrition (TF), as well as changing the femoral line over a wire by an interventional radiologist (IR). The patient has tested negative for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) twice, with the third test pending. Additionally, the patient was discontinued from gentamicin per Infectious Disease (ID) orders.

The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, penicillins, latex, and red dye, as well as a reaction to Darvon (oral), Percodan (oral), aspirin, and fentanyl.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were meropenem, gentamicin, micafungin, linezolid, and acyclovir. They are currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and other medications as part of their ICU care.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and other relevant information.

Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment, skin assessment, and neurologic assessment, all of which were not assessed. Laboratory results show abnormal values for white blood cell count,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a history of acute leukemia, currently admitted to the ICU. The patient has multiple allergies, including medications such as sulfa, penicillins, latex, and red dye. The patient has experienced several complications, including cardiac dysrhythmia, alteration in nutrition, sepsis without organ dysfunction, airway inability to protect, impaired skin integrity, altered mental status, fever of unknown origin, and altered respiratory function.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.6°C (96°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/58 to 119/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. The patient has received various medications, including antibiotics and antifungals.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated blood glucose levels, abnormal liver function tests, and elevated lactate levels. Microbiology cultures have been performed to identify any potential infections.

The patient's condition requires close monitoring, and potential medical complications include sepsis, respiratory failure, impaired skin integrity, and cardiac dysrhythmias. The patient is at risk for aspiration due to an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. Additionally, the patient has a history of malignancy and altered mental status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement. She underwent an Omaya removal due to vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) contamination and also had a subdural hematoma evacuation. The patient was extubated and is now awake, afebrile, and showing a decreasing white blood cell count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Dysrhythmia: The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate within normal limits, but there is a mention of sinus tachycardia. Continuous monitoring of heart rate and rhythm should be done to detect any potential dysrhythmias.
2. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at a rate of 30 mL/hour. Regular assessments of nutritional status and enteral feeding tube function should be performed to ensure adequate nutrition.
3. Sepsis Without Organ Dysfunction: The patient has a history of leukemia and CNS involvement, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of sepsis, such as fever, increased heart rate, and elevated white blood cell count, is crucial. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications.
4. Airway Inability to Protect: The patient has an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance. Tracheostomy or other measures to secure the airway may be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old woman with a history of recurrent acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, who underwent an Omaya removal due to vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) contamination and a subdural hematoma evacuation. She was intubated for cardiac arrest thought to be secondary to calcium channel blocker (CCB) overdose in the setting of hypocalcemia. After extubation, the patient is now awake, afebrile, and her white blood cell (WBC) count is trending downward.

Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac dysrhythmia: The patient had a cardiac arrest, possibly secondary to CCB overdose in the setting of hypocalcemia. However, she is currently doing well.
2. Alteration in nutrition: The patient requires nutritional support, as indicated by the initiation of Nutren Pulmonary (Full) at 30 mL/hour. Consideration should be given to a swallowing evaluation (S+S).
3. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis, which could be due to G-CSF effect, culture-negative bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, or ALL. Repeat C. difficile testing is planned, along with blood and sputum cultures. The leukocytosis is now trending down.
4. Airway, inability to protect: The patient had a risk for"
