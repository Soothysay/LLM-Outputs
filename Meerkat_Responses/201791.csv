","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 50%), permanent pacemaker placement, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, asthma, recent gastrointestinal bleed, who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault. 

The patient meets 3-7 SIRS criteria and has possible sources of infection, including pneumonia given findings on chest X-ray and CT scan, as well as positive urinalysis. The plan is to treat hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin, cefepime, and ciprofloxacin. 

The patient also has anemia from GI bleeding, with a hematocrit level of 28 and stable from recent hospitalization. However, the presence of grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault indicates ongoing blood loss. 

The patient has a urinary tract infection, as indicated by the positive urinalysis. This will be treated with the same antibiotics used for treating pneumonia. 

The patient's renal function has worsened, with a creatinine level of 2.3 from a baseline around 1.5. 

The patient's cardiac status includes coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. 

The patient's blood pressure is low, so anti-hypertensives have been held.

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), asthma, recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). She presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault.

The patient meets three out of seven SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria for septic shock, indicating a possible source of infection such as pneumonia, given findings on chest X-ray and CT scan, physical exam findings, and positive urine analysis. Blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci in clusters, while urine culture indicates the presence of >100,000 organisms/ml of Escherichia coli.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving norepinephrine for hemodynamic support. Her vital signs include a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/52 to 145/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, lactate, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Blood cultures indicate gram-positive cocci growth"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cancer, systolic congestive heart failure, asthma, and hypertension. She was recently admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding and readmitted with bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and shock. The patient has improved with the use of pressors, fluids, and antibiotics. She has allergies to ampicillin and experiences hives as a reaction. The patient is unable to provide her medical history due to a language barrier.

24-hour events include titrating down Levophed overnight. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/71 to 84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on norepinephrine at a rate of 0.06 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include morphine sulfate.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for no new complaints. Flowsheet data shows hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving oxygen through a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is awake, alert, and pleasant. She has crackles at the bases of both lungs, wheezes more prominent on the right side, and an expiratory squeak in the right upper lobe. The patient also has bilateral lower extremity edema"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a medical history of cancer, systolic congestive heart failure, asthma, and hypertension. She was recently admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding and readmitted with bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and shock. The patient's condition improved with the use of pressors, fluids, and antibiotics. She has a known allergy to ampicillin and has been receiving multiple medications including norepinephrine, morphine sulfate, and various antibiotics.

24-hour events include a decrease in Levophed titration overnight. The patient's history could not be obtained due to a language barrier, and her allergies are documented. She is currently on multiple infusions and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.7°C (101.6°F), blood pressure ranging from 129/71 mmHg to 84 mmHg, heart rate between 75-81 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Her mixed venous oxygen saturation is between 48-91%, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,864 mL and output of 540 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,324 mL.

Physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of both lungs, wheezes more prominent on the right side, and expiratory squeak in the right upper lobe. There is also bilateral lower extremity ed"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, implantable pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, asthma, and recent gastrointestinal bleed. The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly blood stool in the rectal vault. She was diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to pneumonia and bacteremia with Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was treated with vancomycin and cefepime, and her urine output improved with fluids and levophed. Other medical conditions include anemia from GI bleeding, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and pneumonia prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's presentation with fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood cultures suggests an ongoing infection, which can lead to septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs, fluid status, and organ function is essential.
2. Multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia: The patient's blood culture showed MRSA, which is a type of bacteria that is resistant to multiple antibiotics. This increases the risk of treatment failure and requires consultation with an infectious disease specialist.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient's elevated"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, placement of permanent pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, asthma, and recent gastrointestinal bleed. She presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault.

Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient meets three of the SIRS criteria and has possible sources of infection, including pneumonia given findings on chest X-ray and CT scan, physical exam findings, and positive urine analysis. Blood cultures show growth of Staphylococcus aureus and E. coli.
2. Anemia from GI bleeding: The patient has a low hemoglobin level (Hct 28) and stable from recent hospitalization. Grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault suggests ongoing bleeding.
3. UTI: The patient has a positive urine analysis with growth of E. coli.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level has increased from baseline around 1.5 to 2.0 today, likely due to prerenal causes. The patient is oliguric with urine output less than 35 ml/hr.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient continues on atorvastatin and may restart carvedilol if blood pressure remains stable in the"

The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and urinary tract infection. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently weaned off levophed. Blood cultures identified MRSA. The patient has allergies to ampicillin, resulting in hives. The patient has received various antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient is also receiving infusions of famotidine, heparin sodium, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75-79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/50-136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is paced. Fluid balance shows a total input of 1,143 mL and total output of 1,125 mL. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, slightly elevated creatinine, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's physical examination findings are mostly not assessed due to being in the ICU. The patient has multiple lines including a multi-lumen line, 18 gauge line, and 22 gauge line. The patient is on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient's code"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic heart failure, pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, asthma, and recent gastrointestinal bleed. She presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient meets three out of the four SIRS (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome) criteria, indicating possible infection. She has positive blood cultures for MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and urine culture for E. coli. The patient was previously on pressors but is now off since yesterday. Her urine output has improved with fluids and levophed. The treatment plan includes vancomycin and cefepime to cover bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia, as well as a urinary tract infection.

2. Anemia from GI bleeding: The patient has a decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct 24) due to gastrointestinal bleeding. This may require blood transfusion to maintain a Hct level above 25.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urine culture for E. coli, indicating a UTI. She is being treated with the same antibiotics as for bacteremia and HAP.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of MRSA sepsis. The patient has been in the ICU and is currently stable. The patient has been weaned off Levo and is on various medications including morphine sulfate, famotidine, heparin sodium, and others. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals wheezes in the chest and edema in the lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia, likely originating from the lung, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient's respiratory failure has been managed, and they are being weaned off pressors with improved hemodynamics. The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by E. coli, acute kidney injury (ARF), and pulmonary vascular congestion which has since resolved. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and they will remain in the ICU for further monitoring. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Worsening respiratory failure if the patient's lung function deteriorates"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male in the ICU with a chief complaint of MRSA sepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, sepsis without organ dysfunction, urinary tract infection (UTI), and acute renal failure (ARF). The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 141/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic measures. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and increased creatinine levels. Imaging reveals pulmonary vascular congestion that has resolved. The patient is expected to remain in the ICU for further monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged ICU stay: The patient's current condition suggests a need for extended monitoring and treatment, which may result in a prolonged stay in the ICU.
2. Organ dysfunction: Although the patient is currently without organ dysfunction, there is a risk that the sepsis could progress and affect vital organs such as the kidneys, liver, or heart.
3. Antibiotic resistance: The presence of MRSA indicates antibiotic resistance, making it crucial to select appropriate antibiotics for effective treatment.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's respiratory failure increases the risk of developing further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, implantable pacemaker and cardioverter-defibrillator, asthma, recent gastrointestinal bleed, who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault. The patient meets criteria for septic shock and has possible sources of infection including pneumonia, given findings on chest X-ray and CT scan, as well as positive urine and blood cultures. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and off pressors, with improved urine output with fluids and levophed. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, famotidine, heparin sodium, furosemide, and morphine sulfate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis and septic shock due to bacteremia and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to hypoperfusion and potential nephrotoxic drugs.
3. Anemia from ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI) with E. coli.
5. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation due to pneumonia.
6. Cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.
7. Hypertension.
8. Congestive heart failure exacerbation.
9. Deep vein thrombosis ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with MRSA bacteremia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate between 75-83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/43-125/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is receiving various medications including vancomycin, cefepime, furosemide, morphine, heparin, famotidine, calcitriol, amiodarone, albuterol, ipratropium, and lasix.

The patient's medical history includes a paced rhythm, MRSA bacteremia, pneumonia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure due to pulmonary edema and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The plan includes continuing gentle diuresis, administering cefepime and vancomycin for MRSA bacteremia and pneumonia, obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), performing an ultrasound of the pacemaker pocket, and keeping the central line for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is attributed to pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and oxygenation is essential to prevent further deterioration.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient"

   Echo: EF dropped to 40%,
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal
   inferior wall and distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall
   and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
   multivessel CAD. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete
   vegetation identified (does not exclude). Compared with the prior study
   (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-23**], the distal inferior wall is now
   hypokinetic (may be related to image quality). The severity of mitral
   regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 y.o. F with CAD s/p anterior apical MI, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF ([**2181-5-23**] EF 50%), s/p PPM and ICD, asthma, recent GI
   bleed, who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly blood stool
   in rectal vault
   # Delirium: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to ICU vs underlying infection vs
   constipation vs medication vs pain
   - treat infection as below
   - frequent reorientation
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - no new meds in last 24 hours
 but will reassess
   - hold off on aggressive diuresis as possible contribution to lasix
   restart home dose lasix today (20 IV lasix = 40 po lasix)
   - d/c foley in near future to minimize tubes
   # Septic Shock: Meets [**3-7**] SIRS criteria with possible sources of
   infection, including pneumonia given findings on CXR and CT and
   phsyical exam findings as well as + UA.  Blood cx with MRSA and urine
   with E. coli. Was on pressors, now off since yesterday. UO improved
   with fluids and levophed.
   - Given likely MRSA pneumonia leading to MRSA bacteremia, will dose at
   least 2 weeks of vancomycin (vanco target 15-20) and 8 days of
   cefepime.
   - treat UTI with above abx as would also cover pathogens
   - f/u ID recs
   - pull CVL and culture tip
   - ID would like TEE today; however given goals of care, likely would
   need intubation, will address with family but likely empiric treatment
   for endocarditis.
   # Anemia from GI bleeding: Hct now 24, slightly done but
   hemodynamically stable. Had grossly bloody stool in rectal vault on
   admission.
   - follow HCT
   # UTI: + UA, E. coli in urine
   - treat as noted above with abx
   # ARF: Cr 2.0 today from baseline around 1.5, prerenal by lytes, no eos
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend Cr, renally dose meds
   # CAD: continue atorvastatin
   # CHF: systolic and diastlic dysfunction in recent echo
   - increase coreg today
   # Afib:
   - continue amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   # HTN:
   - increase coreg to home dose
   # PPX: home PPI, pneumoboots, bowel regimen, hep sc
   # ACCESS: PIV, CVL

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault. The patient has a past medical history of CAD, percutaneous pacemaker placement (PPM), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), asthma, and recent gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. 

The patient's current condition includes delirium, septic shock, anemia from GI bleeding, urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), multivessel CAD, moderate tricuspid regurgitation, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, and mild mitral regurgitation. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Delirium: The patient's delirium may be secondary to ICU stay, underlying infection, constipation, medication, or pain. Treatment includes frequent reorientation, aggressive bowel regimen, and avoiding new medications.
2. Septic Shock: The patient meets SIRS criteria and has possible sources of infection, including pneumonia. Blood cultures with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and urine cultures with Escherichia coli have been obtained. Treatment includes at least two weeks of vancomycin and eight days of cefepime.
3. Anemia from GI bleeding: The patient's hemoglobin level is low due to GI bleeding. Monitoring of HCT is advised.

   Echo: EF dropped to 40%,
   The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with hypokinesis of the distal
   inferior wall and distal half of the anterior septum and anterior wall
   and apex. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 40 %). Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
   present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] Moderate
   [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w
   multivessel CAD. Moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. Mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete
   vegetation identified (does not exclude). Compared with the prior study
   (images reviewed) of [**2181-5-23**], the distal inferior wall is now
   hypokinetic (may be related to image quality). The severity of mitral
   regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation are now increased.
   Assessment and Plan
   82 y.o. F with CAD s/p anterior apical MI, chronic systolic and
   diastolic CHF ([**2181-5-23**] EF 50%), s/p PPM and ICD, asthma, recent GI
   bleed, who presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly blood stool
   in rectal vault
   # Delirium: [**Month (only) 60**] be secondary to ICU vs underlying infection vs
   constipation vs medication vs pain
   - treat infection as below
   - frequent reorientation
   - aggressive bowel regimen
   - no new meds in last 24 hours
 but will reassess
   - hold off on aggressive diuresis as possible contribution to lasix
   restart home dose lasix today (20 IV lasix = 40 po lasix)
   - d/c foley in near future to minimize tubes
   # Septic Shock: Meets [**3-7**] SIRS criteria with possible sources of
   infection, including pneumonia given findings on CXR and CT and
   phsyical exam findings as well as + UA.  Blood cx with MRSA and urine
   with E. coli. Was on pressors, now off since yesterday. UO improved
   with fluids and levophed.
   - Given likely MRSA pneumonia leading to MRSA bacteremia, will dose at
   least 2 weeks of vancomycin (vanco target 15-20) and 8 days of
   cefepime.
   - treat UTI with above abx as would also cover pathogens
   - f/u ID recs
   - pull CVL and culture tip
   - ID would like TEE today; however given goals of care, likely would
   need intubation, will address with family but likely empiric treatment
   for endocarditis.
   # Anemia from GI bleeding: Hct now 24, slightly done but
   hemodynamically stable. Had grossly bloody stool in rectal vault on
   admission.
   - follow HCT
   # UTI: + UA, E. coli in urine
   - treat as noted above with abx
   # ARF: Cr 2.0 today from baseline around 1.5, prerenal by lytes, no eos
   - avoid nephrotoxins
   - trend Cr, renally dose meds
   # CAD: continue atorvastatin
   # CHF: systolic and diastlic dysfunction in recent echo
   - increase coreg today
   # Afib:
   - continue amiodarone
   - monitor on telemetry
   # HTN:
   - increase coreg to home dose

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, previous anterior apical myocardial infarction, chronic systolic and diastolic congestive heart failure, pacemaker placement, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), asthma, and recent gastrointestinal bleed. She presents with fever, leukocytosis, and grossly bloody stool in the rectal vault.

The patient meets the criteria for septic shock with possible sources of infection, including pneumonia given findings on chest X-ray and CT scan, as well as physical exam findings. Blood culture with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and urine culture with Escherichia coli were positive. The patient is currently off pressors but had improved urine output with fluids and levophed.

The plan includes treating bacteremia and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and cefepime for at least two weeks and eight days, respectively. An infectious disease consult is requested for high-grade MRSA bacteremia. The patient also has anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding, a urinary tract infection (UTI), acute renal failure (ARF), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and hypertension (HTN). 

The patient has multiple medical conditions requiring ongoing management, including restarting coreg for CHF, amiodarone for atrial fibrillation,"

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered mental status: most consistent with ICU delirium, correlating
   with time of initiation of diuresis, will dtop agresive diruesis and
   resume home dose of lasix. Creatinine improving, and probably starting
   to redistribute fluid balance. continue to reorient/behavioral
   measures. Transfer to floor where she may be able to sleep better.
   Physicial therpay to ambulate for better sleep at night.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **]): on few liters with stable
   sats. at high risk for aspiration keep NPO. Treating HAp with cefepime.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION: with MRSA sepsis, TTE and pcked
   ultrasoudn negative, high risk for TEE, and may need to be intubated
   for this procedure will discuss with cardiology. continue vancomcycin
   for now. d/c CVL place PICC line
 URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI):
   E.coli on cefepime.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with MRSA bacteremia. They have a history of sepsis, respiratory failure, and a urinary tract infection. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 75-77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/44 to 161/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is lethargic and confused. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,171 mL, including 480 mL of IV fluids, and an output of 2,695 mL, including 860 mL of urine. The patient has right and left lower extremity edema. Blood tests show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Imaging and microbiology results are mentioned but not detailed in the provided information. The patient's plan includes discontinuing aggressive diuresis, resuming home dose of Lasix, and transferring to the floor for better sleep. Physical therapy will be initiated for ambulation. Respiratory failure treatment involves using few liters of oxygen and keeping the patient NPO (nothing by mouth). Sepsis treatment includes continuing vancomycin and discussing the need for intubation for a TEE procedure. The urinary tract infection is being treated with cefepime. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and will remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is at high risk for aspiration due to acute respiratory failure. Measures such as NPO status and oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula are in place.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a history of MRSA bacteremia and sepsis. They are at risk for organ dysfunction and potential deterioration. Treatment with vancomycin and cefepime is ongoing.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has an E. coli infection on cefepime, indicating an ongoing UTI. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy are necessary.
4. Delirium: The patient is lethargic and confused, which may be consistent with ICU delirium. Reorientation and behavioral measures are being implemented to manage this condition.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's fluid balance shows an output of 2,695 mL, indicating potential fluid overload. Adjustments in diuretic therapy may be required.
6. Edema: The presence of right and left lower extremity edema suggests possible fluid retention or venous insufficiency. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

Please note that the provided information is limited, and a comprehensive assessment should be conducted to identify additional potential complications and provide appropriate care for the patient."
