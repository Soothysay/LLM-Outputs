   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This is likely due to V/Q
   mismatch in the setting of possible infiltrate vs. effusion.  Given
   that she
s recently been hospitalized twice within the past month it
   very possible that she has a hospital acquired pneumonia.  Secondly,
   she could have CHF, although the etiology is unknown, and without a hx
   of CHF, this could likely be due to ischemia.  EKG not suggestive of
   ischemia at this time.  Patient without arrhytmia at this point.
   Differential also includes hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions
   a.       Patient weaned down to 50% fio2 with improvement in ABG, would
   follow serial ABG given unable to obtain sats.
   b.       F/u AM ECG, 2 sets negative cardiac enzymes
   c.       Continue with HAP tx with vanco/zosyn
   2.       Infection: patient may have an infiltrate on her CXR, although
   difficult to tell.  Risk factors include recent hospitalizations and
   she does have a leuckocytosis with a marked left shift, which would
   suggest ongoing infection.  DDx also includes aspiration pneumonia
   given location of infiltrate.
   a.       Follow up urine , blood, sputum cultures
   b.       Will empirically treat with Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP
   c.       Follow up urine legionella antigen
   3.       C. difficile: Patient currently undergoing treatment with
   Flagyl for C.diff
   a.       Will continue with IV Flagyl
   4.       Volume depletion: Likely due to dehydration at this point
   given ongoing diarrhea from Cdiff and decreased PO intake.  Patient
   also likely free water depleted.
   a.       Continue NS hydration, for UOP<30cc/hr bolus with prn 250cc
   b.       Will attempt to obtain urine lytes, although patient with
   marginal UO
   5. GOALS OF CARE: Schedule family meeting with PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] and ICU
   staff to establish goals of care.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, which is likely due to a V/Q mismatch possibly caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia or congestive heart failure. The patient's recent hospitalizations increase the likelihood of hospital-acquired pneumonia. The differential diagnosis also includes hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions.

The patient has shown improvement after being weaned down to 50% FiO2, but serial ABG monitoring is needed. Further follow-up with AM ECG and cardiac enzymes is planned to rule out ischemia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be followed up.

The patient is also being treated for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) with IV Flagyl. C. difficile is likely contributing to the patient's volume depletion, along with dehydration and decreased PO intake. The patient will continue with NS hydration and will receive a bolus of 250cc if the UOP is less than 30cc/hr.

A family meeting will be scheduled to establish goals of care, considering the patient's current critical condition. The patient is currently on full code status and receiving ICU care. Nutrition and glycemic control will be discussed pending family discussion. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention with heparin, stress ulcer prevention with PPI, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory distress. She has a history of recent hospitalizations, leukocytosis with a left shift, and possible infiltrate or effusion on imaging. The differential diagnosis includes hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), congestive heart failure (CHF), and hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions. The patient is currently on non-rebreather (NRB) oxygen, and further investigations such as an arterial blood gas (ABG) and cardiac enzymes are planned. Empirical treatment for HAP has been initiated. Other considerations include aspiration pneumonia and C. difficile infection. The patient also has hypernatremia likely due to dehydration and decreased PO intake. Fluid resuscitation with normal saline (NS) is recommended, possibly transitioning to dextrose in water (D5W) or 0.9% sodium chloride in 1/2 normal saline (D51/2NS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This can progress to severe respiratory failure and respiratory arrest if oxygenation does not improve.
2. Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP): If left untreated, it can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): Without appropriate management, it can worsen, leading to cardiogenic shock.
4. C. difficile Infection: If not appropriately"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman with respiratory distress. She has been in the ICU and is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Her ABG results indicate adequate oxygenation. A chest X-ray shows stable bilateral pleural effusions and a more dense left lower lobe infiltrate. She is being covered for nosocomial pneumonia with vancomycin, azithromycin, and metronidazole. Her blood pressure is relatively low, and she appears dry, so she will continue to be volume resuscitated and closely monitored for any impact on oxygenation. She likely has acute renal failure, which is pre-renal in nature. Her urine output with intravenous fluids will be watched, and her urine electrolytes will be checked. She also has a urinary tract infection and is on antibiotics. The family has requested full code status, and there are concerns about nutrition, which will be discussed in a family meeting today. Hospice referral has been initiated, and the patient will be transferred to the floor after the family meeting pending discussions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Nosocomial pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows infiltrates, indicating a possible hospital-acquired infection. This will need to be closely monitored and treated appropriately.
2. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's elevated creatinine level suggests ARF, which may be pre-renal in nature. Close monitoring of urine output and electrolytes is necessary.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient is already on antibiotics for a UTI, and follow-up cultures will be needed to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is relatively low, and she appears dry. Continuous monitoring and volume resuscitation are necessary to ensure adequate perfusion.
5. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation require close monitoring and adjustment of oxygen delivery devices to maintain adequate oxygenation.
6. Malnutrition: The family has expressed concerns about the patient's nutrition. This will need to be addressed during the family meeting and appropriate measures taken to ensure the patient receives adequate nutrition.
7. Code status: The family has requested full code status, which should be respected. The patient's wishes and goals of care should be discussed during the family meeting.

Please note that these potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information or further testing may be required for a more accurate assessment."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, with an ABG indicating adequate oxygenation. A chest X-ray reveals stable bilateral pleural effusions and a denser left lower lobe infiltrate. The patient is being covered for nosocomial pneumonia with vancomycin and azithromycin, and metronidazole is being used to prevent Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's hemodynamics show relative low blood pressure, which appears to be due to dryness. The patient will be volume resuscitated and closely monitored for any impact on oxygenation. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal, and is receiving intravenous fluids. The urine output with IV fluids will be watched, and urine electrolytes will be checked. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection and is currently on antibiotics.

The family has chosen a full code status, and there are concerns about nutrition, which was a big issue during the last admission. In the ICU, the patient is receiving nutrition support, glycemic control, and has multiple lines in place, including an 18-gauge line inserted on 3/29/2113. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are also being implemented.

   The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF 70-80%).
   Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
   ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are
   mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
   the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
   UNDERestimated.] The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The
   supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic.

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This is likely due to V/Q
   mismatch in the setting of possible infiltrate vs. effusion.  Given
   that she
s recently been hospitalized twice within the past month it
   very possible that she has a hospital acquired pneumonia.  Secondly,
   she could have CHF, although the etiology is unknown, and without a hx
   of CHF, this could likely be due to ischemia.  EKG not suggestive of
   ischemia at this time.  Patient without arrhytmia at this point.
   Differential also includes hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions
   a.       Patient weaned down to nasal canula with stable ABG
   b.       TTE shows hyperdynamic EF with LVH, possible component
   diastolic dysfunction, responded to lasix
   c.       Continue with HAP tx with vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   d. Consider CT chest to further evaluate pulmonary effusions and
   parenchyma
   2.       Infection: patient may have an infiltrate on her CXR, although
   difficult to tell.  Risk factors include recent hospitalizations and
   she does have a leuckocytosis with a marked left shift, which would
   suggest ongoing infection.  DDx also includes aspiration pneumonia
   given location of infiltrate.
   a.       Resent urine cx, blood cx gram + rods this is likely
   contaminant, resent blood cx, resent sputum given inadequate sample
   b.       Will empirically treat with Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP
   c.       Urine legionella antigen negative
   3.       C. difficile: Patient currently undergoing treatment with
   Flagyl for C.diff
   a.       Will continue with IV Flagyl, check C.diff
   4.       Volume depletion: Likely due to dehydration at this point

","Based on the provided information, the patient is experiencing multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This is likely due to a V/Q mismatch in the setting of possible infiltrate vs. effusion. The patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF), possibly secondary to ischemia. Other possible causes include hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions.

2. Infection: The patient may have an infiltrate on their chest X-ray, which could be indicative of pneumonia. Risk factors include recent hospitalizations, leukocytosis with a marked left shift suggesting ongoing infection, and aspiration pneumonia given the location of the infiltrate.

3. C. difficile: The patient is currently undergoing treatment with Flagyl for C. difficile infection. It is important to continue with IV Flagyl and check for C. difficile.

4. Volume Depletion: The patient is likely experiencing dehydration due to ongoing diarrhea from C. difficile and decreased oral intake. There is also evidence of fluid overload on the chest X-ray showing edema.

5. Mitral and Tricuspid Regurgitation: The patient has moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation as seen on the transthoracic echo.

6. Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: The patient's left ventricle is hypertrophied and hyperdynamic, with a small cavity size"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This is likely due to V/Q
   mismatch in the setting of possible infiltrate vs. effusion.  Given
   that she
s recently been hospitalized twice within the past month it
   very possible that she has a hospital acquired pneumonia.  Secondly,
   she could have CHF, although the etiology is unknown, and without a hx
   of CHF, this could likely be due to ischemia.  EKG not suggestive of
   ischemia at this time.  Patient without arrhytmia at this point.
   Differential also includes hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions
   a.       Patient weaned down to nasal canula with stable ABG
   b.       TTE shows hyperdynamic EF with LVH, possible component
   diastolic dysfunction, responded to lasix
   c.       Continue with HAP tx with vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   d. Consider CT chest to further evaluate pulmonary effusions and
   parenchyma
   2.       Infection: patient may have an infiltrate on her CXR, although
   difficult to tell.  Risk factors include recent hospitalizations and
   she does have a leuckocytosis with a marked left shift, which would
   suggest ongoing infection.  DDx also includes aspiration pneumonia
   given location of infiltrate.
   a.       Resent urine cx, blood cx gram + rods this is likely
   contaminant, resent blood cx, resent sputum given inadequate sample
   b.       Will empirically treat with Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP
   c.       Urine legionella antigen negative
   3.       C. difficile: Patient currently undergoing treatment with
   Flagyl for C.diff
   a.       Will continue with IV Flagyl, check C.diff
   4.       Volume depletion: Likely due to dehydration at this point
   given ongoing diarrhea from Cdiff and decreased PO intake.  Patient
   also likely free water depleted. CXR shows edema
   a.       Continue NS hydration, for UOP<30cc/hr bolus with prn 250cc
   b.       Urine sodium 54 not c/w volume depletion or failure, possible
   ATN from diastolic dysfunction, infection?
   c.       Consider renal ultrasound if patient  continues unresponsive
   to IVF

   need to discuss feeding tube

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of failure to thrive (FTT). They have been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, infection, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection, and volume depletion. The patient has a history of recent hospitalizations, which increases the risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient's echocardiogram shows hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle with a small cavity size, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This can be caused by V/Q mismatch due to possible infiltrate or effusion. The patient may have hospital-acquired pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Infection: The patient may have an infiltrate on chest X-ray, indicating a possible ongoing infection. Differential diagnosis includes aspiration pneumonia.
3. C. difficile Infection: The patient is currently being treated with Flagyl for C. difficile infection. However, there is a risk of recurrence or inadequate treatment.
4. Volume Depletion: The patient may be experiencing dehydration due to ongoing diarrhea from C. difficile infection and decreased oral intake. The presence of edema on CXR suggests fluid overload.
5. Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN): The patient's urine sodium level of 54 indicates possible ATN, which can be caused by di"

   Assessment and Plan
   1.       Hypoxemic Respiratory Distress: This is likely due to V/Q
   mismatch in the setting of possible infiltrate vs. effusion.  Given
   that she
s recently been hospitalized twice within the past month it
   very possible that she has a hospital acquired pneumonia.  Secondly,
   she could have CHF, although the etiology is unknown, and without a hx
   of CHF, this could likely be due to ischemia.  EKG not suggestive of
   ischemia at this time.  Patient without arrhytmia at this point.
   Differential also includes hypoalbuminemic transudative effusions
   a.       Patient weaned down to nasal canula with stable ABG
   b.       TTE shows hyperdynamic EF with LVH, possible component
   diastolic dysfunction, responded to lasix
   c.       Continue with HAP tx with vanco/zosyn/flagyl
   d.       Consider CT chest to further evaluate pulmonary effusions and
   parenchyma
   2.       Infection/Leukocytosis: patient may have an infiltrate on her
   CXR, although difficult to tell.  Risk factors include recent
   hospitalizations and she does have a leuckocytosis with a marked left
   shift, which would suggest ongoing infection.  DDx also includes
   aspiration pneumonia given location of infiltrate.
   a.       Resent urine cx, blood cx gram + rods this is likely
   contaminant, resent blood cx, resent sputum given inadequate sample
   b.       Will empirically treat with Vancomycin and Zosyn for HAP 10
   day course
   c.       Urine legionella antigen negative
   d.       Continue tx for c. diff
   3.       C. difficile: Patient currently undergoing treatment with
   Flagyl for C.diff
   a.       Will continue with IV Flagyl, check C.diff
   b.       Optimize bowel regimen given no BM since admission
   4.       Volume depletion: Likely due to dehydration at this point
   given ongoing diarrhea from Cdiff and decreased PO intake.  Patient
   also likely free water depleted. CXR shows edema
   a.       PRN furosemide for UOP<30cc/hr
   b.       Urine sodium 54 not c/w volume depletion or failure, possible
   ATN from diastolic dysfunction, infection?
   c.       Consider renal ultrasound if patient  continues unresponsive
   to IVF

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient is a 59-year-old with a chief complaint of FTT (failure to thrive).
- The patient has been experiencing hypoxemic respiratory distress, which may be due to a V/Q mismatch or hospital-acquired pneumonia.
- The patient's TTE (transesophageal echocardiogram) shows hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle with very small cavity size, at least moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
- The patient has an elevated WBC count and evidence of infection or leukocytosis.
- The patient is being treated for C. difficile infection.
- The patient has volume depletion, possibly due to dehydration and decreased PO intake.
- The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by a high urine sodium level.
- The patient requires nutrition support and has shown some improvement in alertness.
- The patient's goals of care are being discussed with the family.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoxemic respiratory distress: This can lead to further deterioration of the patient's respiratory status and potentially progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Infection/leukocytosis: The presence of leukocytosis with a marked left shift suggests ongoing infection. If left untreated, this can lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. C. difficile infection: If not adequately treated, the"

   Assessment and Plan
   1. CHF: bilat eff, pedal edema, hyperdyanamic on Echo but 2+ MR, 3+ did
   tolerate low dose diuresis but need to replete free water deficit. I
   would favor trying to keep euvolemic until we can get her free water in
   range then she will need adjustment with low dose lasix potentially but
   will need to be slow and careful
   2. PNA: LLL
 Vanco/Zosyn empirically
   3. Leukocytosis
 add on differentail
   DDx is her PNA, on RX
   No bowel movement  - check KUB, start bowel reg, C diff. assay, po
   Vanco
   4. Hypernatremia and Hyperchloremia: free water deficit needs repletion
   today with D5W as she cannot take pos
   Trend [**Hospital1 **] as do not want to overshoot
   5. GOALS OF CARE: palliative care to meet with family today to discus
   goals of care
   I had a 1 hour meeting with them yesterdauy where they stated they want
   full treatment but would be willing to consider a DNR
 need to discuss
   amongst themselves. I emphasized that CPR would likely crush all ribs
   and create great physical injury will almost no hope of recovery and
   would not be recommended.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with respiratory distress and is currently in the ICU.
- The patient has a history of hypertrophic, hyperdynamic left ventricle with small cavity size, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation.
- The patient received Lasix last night and diuresis was tolerated at a low dose, but they still need to replete free water deficit.
- The patient's blood pressure is stable.
- The patient has been administered various antibiotics and medications including piperacillin, vancomycin, metronidazole, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn).
- The patient is on several infusions including pantoprazole, furosemide (Lasix), and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.
- Review of systems shows respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges except for a low oxygen saturation level of 76%.
- The patient's lab results indicate hypernatremia, hyperchloremia, leukocytosis, and elevated levels of troponin T and lactate.
- The patient's blood gases show a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 176.
- Physical examination reveals the patient to be agitated, tachycardic, and experiencing pedal edema.
