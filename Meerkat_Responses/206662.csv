   Disposition:
","The patient is a 45-year-old male with a medical history of chronic alcoholism who presented to the hospital with acute pancreatitis. He underwent an ERCP procedure but developed a peri-ampullary abscess leading to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient was intubated and admitted to the ICU for further management.

Since admission, the patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, and his blood cultures have been drawn. He has been receiving aggressive IV fluids and insulin therapy. His head CT scan was negative for any acute processes. The patient's daughter is very distraught, and social work has been consulted.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 172/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient is on a combination of sedation and analgesia.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of amylase and lipase, consistent with acute pancreatitis. He also has elevated glucose levels, indicating hyperglycemia. Other lab results include leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hyponatremia with a sodium level of 117 mg/dL, hyperkalemia with a potassium level of 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient with markedly elevated
   blood sugars, well above critical values.  No clear percipitant from
   family garnered history.  Patient's profile of metabolic acidosis
   consistent with diabetick ketoacisosis, with moderate urine ketones and
   an anion gap acidosis.  That being said, the degree of hyperglycemis is
   far out of range expected with DKA, and more in line with that seen in
   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.  Also consistent with such a
   diagnosis is the serums osms of 360.  The patient is really presenting
   with a mixed picture.
   -- continue insulin gtt per protocol
   -- continue with aggressive fluid repletion, currently receiving 10L.
   Will use NS until volume replete, then switch to 1/2NS watching for
   correted sodium
   -- will follow serial chemistry panels, venous pH, anion gap, and osms
   -- will check q1h FS
   -- when FS < 250, will start patient on D51/2NS.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Again, as above, likely from DKA.  Potiential
   sources of anion gap acidosis are ketones, lactate, and uremia.  Will
   continues to correct sugars, rehydrate patient, and trend anion gap.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a
   combination of electrolyte abnormaltities, hyperglycemia, as most
   imprornatly hyperosmomar gap with cerebral dehydration.  Currently off
   sedation, and is unresponsive.
   -- Correct metabolic derangments and continue to follow.
   .
   # Elevated Lipase:  CT scan w/o contras of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  Will continue to trend lipase daily, and leave NPO
   for now.
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Renal functioning
   improving iwth IVF.
   - send UA and urine lytes
   - continue to trend
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   .
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   .
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's laboratory results indicate a mixed picture of hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis, suggestive of a combination of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolemia: The patient has markedly elevated blood sugars, which is far beyond the expected range for DKA. This indicates a risk of further hyperglycemia and dehydration.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has an anion gap acidosis, likely due to DKA. There is a risk of worsening acidosis if the underlying cause is not appropriately treated.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to various factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolar gap with cerebral dehydration. Correcting metabolic derangements and providing supportive care is crucial.

4. Elevated Lipase: The patient has elevated lipase levels, which could be due to pancreatitis. Monitoring lipase levels and avoiding NPO status might be necessary.

5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function may worsen due to volume depletion in the"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented markedly elevated
   blood sugars, well above critical values.  No clear precipitant from
   family garnered history.  Patient's profile of metabolic acidosis
   consistent with diabetic ketoacisosis, with moderate urine ketones and
   an anion gap acidosis.  That being said, the degree of hyperglycemis is
   far out of range expected with DKA, and more in line with that seen in
   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.  Also consistent with such a
   diagnosis is the serums osms of 360.  The patient is really presenting
   with a mixed picture.  Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with
   insulin gtt, and was transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now
   rebounding, w/ BG up to 350.
   -- initiate basal glucose and start ss/ c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 303**], likely will restart
   gtt
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after 15L of fluid
   -- will follow serial chemistry panels, venous pH, anion gap, and osms,
   but q6hs now that anion gap has closed and osms inproved
   -- will check q1h FS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 7013**] high serum osms are most certainly due to high glucose levels,
   does have a osm gap of 24.  Nothing to suggest toxic ingestion risk
   factors, but will d/w renal if further work up is indicated.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Again, as above, likely from DKA.  Potiential
   sources of anion gap acidosis are ketones, lactate, and uremia or
   possible toxic ingestion.  Will continue to correct sugars, rehydrate
   patient, and trend anion gap.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a
   combination of electrolyte abnormaltities, hyperglycemia, as most
   imprornatly hyperosmomar gap with cerebral dehydration.  Currently off
   sedation, and is unresponsive.  Has facial and left arm myoclonos vs.
   sz.  Gave 2mg IV ativan.
   -- c/s neuro
   -- Correct metabolic derangments and continue to follow.
   .
   # Elevated Lipase:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   .
   # Fevers:  No clear infectious source, and all cultures currently
   pending.  [**Month (only) 51**] have aspirated, w/ thick secretions, when was w/ AMS.

   state and electrolyte derangement.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1), recent insulin pump placement, and CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. He had profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient's profile of metabolic acidosis is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), but the degree of hyperglycemia is far out of range expected with DKA, more in line with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). The patient has mixed presentation of both DKA and HHS.

The patient's blood glucose was corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt (intravenous insulin), and he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. However, his sugars are now rebounding, with a blood glucose level of 350. It is recommended to initiate basal glucose and start sc (subcutaneous) insulin, likely restarting gtt (intravenous insulin).

The patient is adequately resuscitated after receiving 15 liters of fluid. Serial chemistry panels, venous pH, anion gap, and osms will be followed every 6 hours now that the anion gap has closed, and osms have improved. Frequent blood glucose checks (q1h) will also be done.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to a combination of electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), electrolyte disturbances, and altered mental status. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU and has been experiencing several medical complications.

1. Hyperglycemia/DKA: The patient was on an insulin drip initially but has been transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. The glucose levels have improved since admission but are not yet optimal. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started due to a possible infection as a precipitant.

2. AMS (altered mental status) secondary to sedation/DKA: The patient is unresponsive to painful stimuli. A CT scan of the head did not reveal any abnormalities, and a neurology consultation has been requested.

3. Elevated lipase/amylase levels consistent with pancreatitis: The enzyme levels are trending downward, and surgery will be following up. The CT scan is consistent with pancreatitis.

4. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection. The current ventilator settings are adequate, and weaning of oxygen and performing a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) once the patient is more alert is planned.

5. Renal failure: The patient is experiencing renal failure, which requires further evaluation and management.

6. Fever: The patient has a fever, and cultures have been obtained. Empiric coverage pending culture data guidance has been initiated.

7. Hypertension: The patient required the start of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of alcohol and drug abuse and was admitted with altered mental status. The patient's temperature has been spiking, indicating possible infection or inflammation. The EEG performed showed no seizure activity, but the patient continues to have myoclonic jerks of the face and right arm with stimulation.

The patient is receiving insulin, lorazepam, dextrose, and pantoprazole through infusions. They are also on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set at a tidal volume of 690 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's blood cultures are positive for gram-positive cocci and rods, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.

The patient has elevated white blood cell count, glucose levels, and creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure. The patient's electrolytes show low potassium and calcium levels. The abdominal examination reveals no bowel sounds, which may indicate a problem with bowel motility or obstruction. The patient has edema in both lower extremities.

The patient's imaging shows no pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF), but the NG tube needs to be advanced further. The respiratory culture shows sparse growth of oropharyngeal flora.

The patient's medical team is concerned about the following potential medical complications:"

   Assessment and Plan
   The patinet is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented markedly elevated
   blood sugars, well above critical values.  No clear precipitant from
   family garnered history.  Patient's profile of metabolic acidosis
   consistent with diabetic ketoacisosis, with moderate urine ketones and
   an anion gap acidosis.  That being said, the degree of hyperglycemis is
   far out of range expected with DKA, and more in line with that seen in
   hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.  Also consistent with such a
   diagnosis is the serums osms of 360.  The patient is really presenting
   with a mixed picture.  Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with
   insulin gtt, and was transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now
   rebounding, w/ BG up to 350.
   -- initiate basal glucose and start ss/ c/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 303**], likely will restart
   gtt
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after 15L of fluid
   -- will follow serial chemistry panels, venous pH, anion gap, and osms,
   but q6hs now that anion gap has closed and osms inproved
   -- will check q1h FS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 7013**] high serum osms are most certainly due to high glucose levels,
   does have a osm gap of 24.  Nothing to suggest toxic ingestion risk
   factors, but will d/w renal if further work up is indicated.
   .
   # Metabolic Acidosis:  Again, as above, likely from DKA.  Potiential
   sources of anion gap acidosis are ketones, lactate, and uremia or
   possible toxic ingestion.  Will continue to correct sugars, rehydrate
   patient, and trend anion gap.
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a
   combination of electrolyte abnormaltities, hyperglycemia, as most
   imprornatly hyperosmomar gap with cerebral dehydration.  Currently off
   sedation, and is unresponsive.  Has facial and left arm myoclonos vs.
   sz.  Gave 2mg IV ativan.
   -- c/s neuro
   -- Correct metabolic derangments and continue to follow.
   .
   # Elevated Lipase:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   .
   # Fevers:  No clear infectious source, and all cultures currently
   pending.  [**Month (only) 51**] have aspirated, w/ thick secretions, when was w/ AMS.
   Also, with risk factors for central fevers given current unresponsive
   state and electrolyte derangement.
   - f/u pan-culture
   - cont [**Doctor Last Name **]/zosyn and narrow pending cultures
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   .
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA

   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of
   hypertension more suggestive of central process.  Cont labatolol and
   uptitrate to 300mg for goal < 140.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1), recent insulin pump placement, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient also has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS): The patient presented with markedly elevated blood sugars, well above critical values. This is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) but also shows features of HHS due to the high serum osms and metabolic acidosis.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient likely has anion gap acidosis due to ketones, lactate, uremia, or possible toxic ingestion. Correcting sugars, rehydrating the patient, and trending anion gap are important.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolar gap with cerebral dehydration. Correcting metabolic derangements is essential.

4. Elevated Lipase: The patient has elevated lipase levels, which could be indicative of pancreatitis. A CT scan without contrast was performed, but it showed little utility. Consulting general surgery is recommended.

5. Fevers: The patient has fevers without a clear infectious source"

   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- neuro reccs
   -- likely MRI head today
   -- LP
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data

    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) who presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient's recent events include a neuro consultation with an EEG that did not show seizure activity, and a lumbar puncture (LP) is recommended. The patient has also been placed on acyclovir and further evaluation with an MRI is suggested to exclude acute infectious/inflammatory processes such as cerebritis/encephalitis or ischemic causes.

The patient's medical history includes a recent insulin pump placement, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) with a creatinine level of 2.3, and a history of alcohol and drug abuse. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/49 to 153/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on endotracheal tube ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds, symmetric chest expansion, soft abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows the patient is not attentive, does not follow simple commands, responds intermittently, and exhibits movement, tone"

   24 Hour Events:
   [**2190-12-21**]
   - spoke to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] history of alcohol/drug abuse or suicidality
   - spoke to family; he was depressed recently because his license was
   suspended, but family doesn't think he'd attempt suicide
   - neuro consult called- EEG performed without seizure activity.  Not
   quite clear what the cause of the jerking could be
   - continued to spike temps, but slightly less.  may need to consider LP
   - OSH called, blood cx positive for GPCs
   [**12-22**]
   -- Patient taken off insulin gtt, BG under good control throughout day,
   never above 190
   - No speciation on OSH BCx
   - Repeat NCHCT w/ atypical b/l temporal lobe hypodensities, radiology
   not clear if chronic, but stable from last CT.  I added on acyclovir
   and we should address need for LP today

The patient's hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia is managed by correcting blood glucose levels with insulin gtt and transitioning to sc insulin. Sugars are now under better control.

The patient's pancreatitis should be evaluated further, with a CT scan w/o contrast showing little utility. Elevated amylase and pancreatic edema may indicate pancreatitis, which could have precipitated the event. General surgery consultation is recommended.

The patient's acute on chronic renal failure is likely due to diabetic nephropathy, with acute worsening from volume depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state. Muddy brown casts are consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Renal recommendations should be followed, including avoiding nephrotoxic medications and holding home lisinopril.

The patient's history of hypertension should be managed by"

   Chief Complaint: Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1
   with a recent insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in
   respiratory distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   24 Hour Events:
   [**2190-12-21**]
   - spoke to PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] history of alcohol/drug abuse or suicidality
   - spoke to family; he was depressed recently because his license was
   suspended, but family doesn't think he'd attempt suicide
   - neuro consult called- EEG performed without seizure activity.  Not
   quite clear what the cause of the jerking could be
   - continued to spike temps, but slightly less.  may need to consider LP
   - OSH called, blood cx positive for GPCs
   [**12-22**]
   -- Patient taken off insulin gtt, BG under good control throughout day,
   never above 190
   - No speciation on OSH BCx
   - Repeat NCHCT w/ atypical b/l temporal lobe hypodensities, radiology
   not clear if chronic, but stable from last CT.  I added on acyclovir
   and we should address need for LP today

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- neuro reccs
   -- likely MRI head today
   -- LP
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data
   -- management of DKA as below
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1), recent insulin pump placement, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's recent events include speaking to the primary care physician (PCP), family, and neuro consult. An EEG was performed without seizure activity. The patient continues to spike temperatures, and it may be necessary to consider a lumbar puncture (LP). The Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) called, and blood culture results were positive for Gram-positive cocci.

On 12-22, the patient's blood glucose was under good control throughout the day, never above 190. No speciation on OSH BCx was done. A repeat neuroimaging with atypical bilateral temporal lobe hypodensities was noted, and radiology is not clear if chronic, but stable from the last CT. Acyclovir was added, and the need for LP today should be addressed. Renal consult moved forward with diuresis, and 40 mg IV lasix was given this morning. Allergies are not reported, and the last dose of antibiotics was Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 12-22 at 06:00 PM.

      FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- f/u CSF HSV, cultures
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- d/c'd ampicillin per ID
   -- neuro and ID reccs
   -- clarify need for head MRI
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data
   -- management of DKA as below
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w

   - f/u renal recs
   - started lasix 40 iv bid per renal
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of

The patient underwent a lumbar puncture on 2190-12-23 at 10:28 AM and blood cultures were taken at 06:19 PM on the same day. The patient has no known drug allergies.

The patient received several antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 2190-12-22 at 06:00 PM, cefepime on 2190-12-23 at 03:00 PM, and vancomycin on 2190-12-23 at 09:37 PM. Acyclovir was administered on 2190-12-24 at 02:00 AM.

The patient is currently on propofol infusion at a rate of 30 mcg/Kg/min. Other ICU medications include furosemide (Lasix) given on 2190-12-23 at 08:30 AM, pantoprazole (Protonix) given on 2190-12-23 at 09:37 PM, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis started on 2190-12-24 at 06:24 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 60 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 118/55 mmHg to 163/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 111.5 kg and height is 72 inches. Central venous pressure is 8 mmHg.

The patient has received a total of 2,452 mL of fluids since admission, with 1,095 mL of total in and 1,340 mL of total out. Blood products totaling 2,590 mL have been transfused, and the patient has had a urine output of 2,580 mL. The patient has also had 10 mL of nasogastric drainage.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 833 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, respiratory rate set at 8 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 20.

      FLUID CULTURE (Preliminary):
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- f/u CSF HSV, cultures
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- d/c'd ampicillin per ID
   -- neuro and ID reccs
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data
   -- management of DKA as below
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - continue to trend
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of
   hypertension more suggestive of central process.  Cont labatolol and
   uptitrate to 300mg for goal < 140.
   # FEN: IVFs / replete lytes prn / NPO for now
   # PPX: H2 blocker, heparin SQ, bowel regimen
   # ACCESS: PIV, R SCL from OSH will need to be replaced

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) and recent insulin pump placement, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient underwent a lumbar puncture, blood cultures were taken, and various medications were administered including antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam, cefipime, vancomycin) and acyclovir.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is 37.1°C, heart rate is 60 bpm, blood pressure is 118/55 mmHg, respiratory rate is 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with the following settings: tidal volume of 833 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 20.

The patient's physical examination reveals normal peripheral pulses and skin, but neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient's unresponsiveness. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 16.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) at 8.0 g/dL, glucose at 179 mg/d"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to severe pancreatitis. The patient's current condition remains unchanged from the previous day. Cultures are still pending from the nasogastric tube. The patient is still not following commands but is responding to noxious stimuli. Diuresis continues as per the renal team's plan.

The patient has a history of hypertension, pancreatitis, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and seizure disorder. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/56 mmHg to 153/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,487 mL and output of 2,828 mL over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.0 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 67 mg/dL to 179 mg/dL, acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL, and elevated liver enzymes including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- f/u CSF HSV, cultures
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- d/c'd ampicillin per ID
   -- neuro and ID reccs
   -- clarify need for head MRI
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data
   -- management of DKA as below
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, and hypertension. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood glucose level of 67 mg/dL. His renal function is impaired, and he is receiving diuretic therapy. The patient has multiple comorbidities and is at risk for various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections due to being intubated and receiving invasive procedures. Cultures are pending, and he is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, which may progress to end-stage renal disease if not properly managed. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate diuretic therapy are necessary.

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old man with type I diabetes mellitus who was admitted to the ICU with unresponsiveness and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been experiencing a prolonged acidemic state, and there is uncertainty regarding the cause of his unresponsiveness. A lumbar puncture suggested partially treated meningitis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving propofol for sedation.

The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/55 mmHg to 153/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 111.5 kg, and he is 72 inches tall. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an input of 3,487 mL and output of 2,828 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 659 mL. The patient is receiving fluids through intravenous (IV) administration, and there is also evidence of urine output.

The patient's respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's respiratory system compliance (RSBI) is 23, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is 11 cmH2O, and arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, normal cardiovascular examination, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurological examination shows no acute distress, and the patient responds to painful stimuli but does not have assessed movement, tone, or skin condition.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low sodium levels, normal potassium levels, moderately elevated creatinine levels, and elevated white blood cell count (WBC). Other lab values, including liver function tests, cardiac markers, and electrolyte levels, are within normal ranges.

Assessment and plan:
The patient's persistently altered mental status is likely due to resolving delirium, partially treated meningitis, or possible permanent neurologic damage from prolonged acidosis. The patient will continue to receive empirical treatment for possible bacterial and viral meningoencephalitis. A brain MRI has been ordered, and follow-up cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests for HSV and culture results will be obtained. The patient will continue on vancomycin, cefepime, and acyclovir.

The patient is ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status and cannot be extubated until his mental status improves. DKA has resolved, but acute on chronic renal failure is present,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with type I diabetes mellitus who was admitted with unresponsiveness and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has persistent unresponsiveness of unclear etiology, which is thought to be due to a prolonged acidemic state or resolving metabolic encephalopathy. A lumbar puncture was performed, suggesting partially treated meningitis.

The patient continues to be on mechanical ventilation and remains responsive only to painful stimuli when propofol is held for neurologic checks. Allergies are not reported. The patient has received various antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, vancomycin, and acyclovir.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 129/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is 111.5 kg, and height is 72 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 11 mmHg. Fluid balance indicates a total input of 3,487 mL and total output of 2,828 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 659 mL.

The patient is receiving propofol for sedation and has been on ventilator support with settings including positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive.
   Has facial and left arm myoclonos.  No seizure activity on EEG.
   -- f/u CSF HSV, cultures
   -- continue vanc, cefipime, acyclovir
   -- d/c'd ampicillin per ID
   -- neuro and ID reccs
   -- clarify need for head MRI
   -- added on vanc level
   -- f/u culture data
   -- management of DKA as below
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - started lasix 40 iv bid per renal
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of
   hypertension more suggestive of central process.  Cont labatolol and
   uptitrate to 300mg for goal < 140.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 and recent insulin pump placement, presenting in respiratory distress and altered mental status. He has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and his blood glucose levels are relatively well-controlled. Neurologic recovery prognosis is bleak, as per the neuro attending. An MRI was performed overnight, and the patient is responding to noxious stimuli but does not follow commands. Diuresis continues per renal, and Lasix started, negative over 2L. The IV nurse is unable to place a PICC line, ordered for IR.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and symptoms of myoclonus may indicate encephalopathy, potentially due to infection or DKA. Further evaluation and management are recommended.
2. Meningitis: There is concern for meningitis given the head CT results and the presence of GPCs in the blood culture. CSF HSV and cultures should be followed up, and current antibiotics should be continued.
3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented with DKA and ongoing lethargy. Blood glucose levels were corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt, and the patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. Sugars are now under better control. Basal glucose and HISS should be continued, and Lantus dosage should"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive
   with poor prognosis per neuro.
   -- f/u CSF cultures
   -- f/u head MRI
   -- continue vanc, cefipime
   -- can d/c acyclovir
   -- neuro and ID reccs
   -- added on vanc level
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] reccs
   -- patient is currently adequately resuscitated after >15L of fluid
   -- p.m. chemistry panel though do not anticipate osmolar gap re-opening
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - started lasix gtt
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # Hypernatremia:  will add Chlorothiazide but will likely need to
   increase free water boluses
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of
   hypertension more suggestive of central process.  Cont labatolol and
   uptitrate to 300mg for goal < 140.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) and recent insulin pump placement, CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) with a creatinine level of 2.3, who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.

The patient's recent events include:
- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was planned but not performed yet.
- Cultures remained negative for gram-positive cocci in the blood culture bottle.
- Antibiotics were changed, and acyclovir was stopped as there were no signs of viral infection.
- The patient's blood glucose levels are relatively well controlled throughout the day.
- Lasix (furosemide) started, but the diuresis was negative over 2 liters.
- Intravenous nurse was unable to place a percutaneous central catheter (PICC); ordered for interventional radiology (IR).
- Neuro attending feels that the prognosis for neurological recovery is bleak, and this opinion was communicated to the family.
- An MRI was done overnight.
- Heparin sodium (prophylaxis) was started at 06:00 AM on 12/26.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on 12/24 at 08:25 PM, acyclovir on 12/25 at 02:00 PM, and cefepime on 12/25 at 04:00 PM. The patient is currently receiving propofol at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min, furosemide (Lasix) at 8 mg/hour, and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 10:45 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data as of 08:14 AM on 12/26 shows the following vital signs: temperature (Tmax) at 37.1°C (98.7°F), current temperature (Tcurrent) at 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate (HR) at 63 bpm, blood pressure (BP) at 121/54 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) at 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) at 100%, and heart rhythm at sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, no malar rash or glossitis, right lower extremity edema at 2+, left lower extremity edema at 2+, clear anteriorly chest, and no withdrawal to pain.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 10.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 7.4 g"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type I who was admitted on [**2190-12-20**] with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). His blood glucose level at admission was 1200 mg/dL, and his anion gap has since closed. However, he continues to have an altered mental status. The patient's prognosis for significant neurological improvement is poor, as discussed with the neurology attending and the family.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including propofol, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), heparin sodium, labetalol, cefepime, and vancomycin. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 121/54 mmHg, heart rate of 63 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's fluid balance shows a net negative balance of 2082 mL since [**2190-12-25**] 09:30 PM. His electrolyte levels are within normal ranges, except for a slightly elevated potassium level of 4.3 mEq/L. The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Persistently altered mental status due to resolving delirium, partially
   treated meningitis, or possible permanent neurologic damage from
   prolonged acidosis. This is a diagnosis of exclusion and pt will
   continue to receive empirical treatment for possible bacterial and
   viral meningoencephalitis.
   Altered mental status
   -continues on propofol due to episodic chewing on ETT.  Will stop
   propofol to perform a neurologic exam off sedation today
   -followup results of brain MRI given areas of low attenuation in
   bilateral temporal horns
   -CSF HSV negative
   -continues on vancomycin and cefepime for 2 week course.  Vancomycin
   trough elevated, will recheck trough and dose
   Ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -unable to extubate until mental status improved.  If predicted long
   term ventilator dependence will need to consider placement of
   tracheostomy
   -continues on PS 5/5/0.4
   DKA now resolved

","The patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 who presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis and altered mental status. His anion gap has closed, but he continues to have persistently altered mental status. He has been receiving insulin therapy and his blood glucose levels have been relatively well-controlled throughout the day. Lasix has been started, and the patient has received a total of 2 liters. The patient's family was informed that his prognosis for significant neurologic improvement is poor, and an MRI was obtained overnight, with results pending.

The patient has no known drug allergies. He has received antibiotics including vancomycin, acyclovir, and cefepime. He is currently on propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min, furosemide (Lasix) at 8 mg/hour, and pantoprazole (Protonix) at 40 mg every 12 hours. Other medications include protonix, label, RISS, cefepime, and vancomycin.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the addition of respiratory distress. The flow sheet data shows stable vital signs, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 121/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus type I who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis. The anion gap has been closed, but the patient still exhibits altered mental status. The neuro attending believes the prognosis for neurological recovery is bleak. The patient's blood glucose levels have been relatively well-controlled throughout the day. Lasix has been started, but no significant output has been observed. A PICC line could not be placed, so an order for interventional radiology (IR) has been made.

The patient's medications include vancomycin, acyclovir, cefepime, propofol, furosemide (Lasix), pantoprazole (Protonix), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medical history and review of systems remain unchanged from admission.

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/54 to 157/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressures set at 5 cmH2O for peak inspiratory pressure and 5 cmH2O for positive end-expiratory pressure. The fraction of inspired oxygen is 40%, and the respiratory system compliance index is 38.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite closure of the anion gap and relatively good control of blood glucose throughout the day, he continues to have an altered mental status. The attending neurologist feels that the prognosis for neurological recovery is bleak. An MRI was performed overnight, and the family hopes to meet with the neurologist today. The patient has been receiving various medications, including insulin, Lasix, propofol, pantoprazole, and heparin sodium. He is also on prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged altered mental status: The patient's persistently altered mental status despite closure of the anion gap and controlled blood glucose levels raises concerns about potential neurological complications or sequelae from diabetic ketoacidosis.
2. Neurological recovery: Given the neurologist's pessimistic outlook on the patient's prognosis for neurological recovery, there is a potential risk of long-term disability or permanent neurological impairment.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving prophylactic antibiotics, indicating a concern for potential infection. This could include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to endotracheal intubation.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures have been taken, but"

   IMPRESSION:
   1. Multifocal subacute infarction, configuration and distribution favor
   hypoxic ischemic insult such as sustained during acute hypotension,
   cardiac
   arrest. Given gyriform configuration, the embolic etiology is felt less
   likely, however, remains a differential consideration.
   2. No evidence of mass effect, edema, herniation or hemorrhage.
   3. Pansinusitis.
   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive
   with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for anoxic brain injury
   (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- MRI with likely anoxic brain injury; possibly septic emboli though
   doesn
t have any positive blood cultures
   -- continue vanc, cefepime
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family would like PEG/trach- but will have a family meeting
   discussing all options.
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- will check c.diff
   -- cont vanco/cefepime for now which would cover sinusitis as well
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.  Resolved; stable
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, recent insulin pump placement, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with encephalopathy, low-grade fever, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, pancreatitis, acute-on-chronic renal failure, and hypertension. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, insulin, and other ICU medications. His lab results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, abnormal kidney function, elevated liver enzymes, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies reveal findings consistent with anoxic brain injury and pansinusitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's current mechanical ventilation and history of respiratory distress, there is a risk of further respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or aspiration pneumonia.
2. Infection: The patient's presentation suggests possible infections including meningitis, septic emboli, and sinusitis. These infections could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
3. Renal Failure: The patient's acute-on-chronic renal failure indicates compromised kidney function. This increases the risk of further deterioration in renal function and potential need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely from a combination of
   infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also concern for meningitis given
   head CT. Currently off sedation > 72 hrs and is minimally responsive
   with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for anoxic brain injury
   (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- f/u final head MRI
   -- continue vanc, cefipime
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family would like PEG/trach
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics.
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- will check c.diff
   -- cont vanco/cefepime for now
    #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in
   setting of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from
   OSH. Blood glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u

   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.  Resolved; stable
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - started lasix gtt; goal I/O -1 to -2L/day
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # Hypernatremia:
   - cont free H2O flush at 250 q6H; can increase if needed
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 and CRI who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The assessment and plan include several potential medical complications:

1. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to a combination of infection (given GPCs in bcx) and DKA. There is also concern for meningitis given the head CT. The patient is currently off sedation for over 72 hours and is minimally responsive with a poor prognosis per neuro. An MRI is concerning for anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH initially).

2. Low-grade temps: The patient has had low-grade temperatures, most likely a central process. No clear infectious source is present, and the patient is still on continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. Blood/urine/sputum cultures have been sent, and CSF cultures are negative. The patient will also be checked for C. difficile, and vancomycin and cefepime will be continued for now.

3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in DKA in the setting of ongoing lethargy. Blood glucose was corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt, and the patient was transitioned to sc insulin. Sugars are now under better control. Basal glucose and HISS will be continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1), recent insulin pump placement, and chronic renal insufficiency (Cr 2.3). He presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status, and was found to have profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient's encephalopathy is likely due to a combination of infection (given GPCs in blood cultures) and DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). There is also concern for meningitis given the head CT findings.

The patient has been off sedation for over 72 hours and is minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neuro. An MRI showed likely anoxic brain injury, possibly septic emboli, although no positive blood cultures were found. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vanc, cefepime) have been continued as recommended by neurology and ID (infectious disease) teams. The family has agreed to PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) and tracheostomy.

The patient has low-grade temperatures, most likely due to a central process. No clear infectious source is present, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued. MRI findings also show pansinusitis. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures have been sent for follow-up, and CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) cultures were negative. Vancomycin and cefepime have been continued"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU is as follows:

The patient has been admitted with an inability to protect their airway, which poses a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. They are currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient experienced a seizure and is now in a state of status epilepticus. They are being treated accordingly.

The patient has hypertension but it is considered benign at this time.

The patient is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis and acute renal failure (acute renal failure, ARF). These conditions require close monitoring and specific treatment.

The patient presents with altered mental status, not delirium, and hyperglycemia. These conditions need to be addressed and managed properly.

In terms of potential medical complications, based on the information provided, the following complications could arise:

1. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the inability to protect the airway, there is a risk of aspirating gastric contents, leading to aspiration pneumonia.

2. Sepsis: With the presence of multiple cultures taken (blood, urine, sputum), there is a possibility of developing sepsis if an infection is identified and not appropriately managed.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU. Prophylaxis measures are in place but close monitoring is still required"

 GPCs on gram stain
   Blood, Urine, CSF all NGTD
   MRI
 Multifocal diffuse infarction, favor anoxic/hypotensive injury
   versus less likely embolic etiology
   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI.  Poor neuro exam.  Cannot exclude
   superimposed CNS infectious process (although cultures unrevealing) or
   hyperosmolar injury.  Had myoclonic movements on admission, EEG
   negative.
   - Appreciate neuro input, feel minimal chance of recovery
   - Tentative plan for trach/PEG, but will rediscuss with family
 Respiratory Insufficiency
 Intubated largely for airway protection,
   doing well on [**4-13**], good cough and gag, so could consider trying to
   extubate without going to trach.  RSBI 40.
   - Will discuss GOC with family, if they want PEG, consider extubating
   after PEG.
 Fever
 Has pan-sinusitis by CT, also consider VAP, C diff, or
   central process.  On broad spectrum abx (vanco, cefepime) for 7 days,
   will continue for now.
Slow decrease in Hct
 Unclear etiology, stool heme negative two days
   ago.  Likely secondary to phlebotomy but follow.
Hypernatremia
 Improving with free water boluses
   - Continue free water bolus
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 Likely ATN given
   muddy brown casts, baseline Cr 2.0-2.3, avoiding nephrotoxins,
   diuresing well.
   - I/O goal -1-2L per 24hrs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical issues. 

1. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient suffered from hypotension at the onset of symptoms, resulting in an anoxic brain injury as indicated by the MRI findings.

2. Respiratory Insufficiency: The patient is currently intubated for airway protection due to respiratory insufficiency. There is a plan to discuss tracheostomy and gastrostomy with the family, considering the possibility of extubation.

3. Fever: The patient has had persistent fever, which could be due to pansinusitis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), Clostridium difficile infection, or a central process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.

4. Slow decrease in Hematocrit (Hct): The cause of the slow decrease in Hct is unclear, but it may be secondary to phlebotomy. This will be monitored and followed.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are improving with free water boluses. Continued administration of free water is recommended.

6. Acute Renal Failure: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) based on muddy brown casts, baseline creatinine levels, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and good urine output. The goal is to maintain a urine output of 1-2 liters per 24 hours and monitor electrolytes and creatinine trends.

7. Hyperglycemia: The patient is on insulin therapy (Lantus and regular insulin), which is being adjusted as needed based on fasting blood sugar levels.

8. Hypertension/Hyperlipidemia: The patient is receiving a statin and labetalol for blood pressure control and lipid management.

9. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient had resolved acute pancreatitis.

10. ICU Care: The patient requires tube feeds, close monitoring of glycemic control, and prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CNS infectious process: Despite negative cultures, there is a possibility of a superimposed CNS infectious process due to the altered mental status.
2. Hyperosmolar injury: The patient's hyperosmolar state may contribute to ongoing neurological impairment.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory insufficiency may lead to further complications if not managed properly.
4. VAP: The persistent fever raises concerns for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
5. C. difficile infection: The patient's antibiotic use increases the risk of developing Clostridium difficile infection.
6. Renal failure progression: Acute renal failure may worsen if appropriate measures are not taken to prevent further kidney damage.
7. Poor glycemic control: Inadequate management of hyperglycemia may lead to further complications.
8. Hypertension: Uncontrolled hypertension could have long-term consequences.
9. Hyperlipidemia: Poor management of hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of cardiovascular events."

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI.  Poor neuro exam.  Cannot exclude
   superimposed CNS infectious process (although cultures unrevealing) or
   hyperosmolar injury.  Had myoclonic movements on admission, EEG
   negative.
   - Appreciate neuro input, feel minimal chance of recovery
   - Tentative plan for trach/PEG, but will rediscuss with family
 Respiratory Insufficiency
 Intubated largely for airway protection,
   doing well on [**4-13**], good cough and gag, so could consider trying to
   extubate without going to trach.  RSBI 40.
   - Will discuss GOC with family, if they want PEG, consider extubating
   after PEG.
 Fever
 Has pan-sinusitis by CT, also consider VAP, C diff, or
   central process.  On broad spectrum abx (vanco, cefepime) for 7 days,
   will continue for now.
Slow decrease in Hct
 Unclear etiology, stool heme negative two days
   ago.  Likely secondary to phlebotomy but follow.
Hypernatremia
 Improving with free water boluses
   - Continue free water bolus
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 Likely ATN given
   muddy brown casts, baseline Cr 2.0-2.3, avoiding nephrotoxins,
   diuresing well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient was admitted to the ICU in a state of altered mental status due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar state. They were obtunded and required intubation for airway protection. The patient's condition has been relatively stable since admission, with improvements in their respiratory support and blood glucose levels. However, they continue to experience episodes of apnea, and their neurologic status remains poor with sedation and unresponsiveness.

The patient's medical history includes type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. They have been diagnosed with acute renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), pancreatitis, and anoxic brain injury. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, blood glucose levels, and liver enzymes. The electrolyte levels are within normal limits, except for hypernatremia, which is improving with free water boluses.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory insufficiency: The patient is still intubated, and there is a possibility of tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) being planned. This could potentially lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy site infection.
2. Neurological complications: Given the patient's poor neurologic exam and history of anoxic brain injury, there is a risk of further neurological deterioration or the"

 GPCs on gram stain
   Blood, Urine, CSF all NGTD
   MRI
 Multifocal diffuse infarction, favor anoxic/hypotensive injury
   versus less likely embolic etiology
   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI.  Poor neuro exam.  Cannot exclude
   superimposed CNS infectious process (although cultures unrevealing) or
   hyperosmolar injury.  Had myoclonic movements on admission, EEG
   negative.
   - Appreciate neuro input, feel minimal chance of recovery
   - Family meeting to discuss management options, goals
 Respiratory Insufficiency
 Intubated largely for airway protection,
   doing well on [**4-13**], good cough and gag, so could consider trying to
   extubate without going to trach.  RSBI 40.
   - Will discuss GOC with family, if they want PEG, consider extubating
   after PEG.
 Fever
 Has pan-sinusitis by CT, also consider VAP, C diff, or
   central process.  On broad spectrum abx (vanco, cefepime) for 7 days,
   will continue for now.
Slow decrease in Hct
 Unclear etiology, stool heme negative two days
   ago.  Likely secondary to phlebotomy but follow.
Hypernatremia
 Improving with free water boluses
   - Continue free water bolus
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 Likely ATN given
   muddy brown casts, baseline Cr 2.0-2.3, avoiding nephrotoxins,
   diuresing well.
   - I/O goal -1-2L per 24hrs
   - Trend lytes, Cr
 HYPERGLYCEMIA
 On lantus, q6h regular, sliding scale, follow.  One
   high sugar yesterday, adjust if needed.
 HYPERTENSION/HYPERLIPIDEMIA
 Continue statin and labetalol.  Good BP
   control
 PANCREATITIS, ACUTE
 Resolved.

","The patient presents with a chief complaint of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and coma, as mentioned in the admission note. The patient was found obtunded in DKA and hyperosmolar state. 

The patient is currently on ventilatory support due to respiratory insufficiency, which is likely secondary to anoxic brain injury as indicated by the MRI findings. The plan is to discuss tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) with the family. The patient has had brief episodes of apnea and has been on mechanical ventilation, but is now on pressure support ventilation (PSV).

The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (VAP), central line infection, or Clostridium difficile infection. Fever has been present, and the patient has pan-sinusitis on CT scan.

The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been slowly decreasing, which is unclear in etiology. There is no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding as stool heme has been negative. It is likely secondary to phlebotomy, and the trend should be followed.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving with free water boluses. The goal is to continue free water boluses.

The patient likely has acute renal failure (ARF), possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The baseline creatinine level was 2.0-"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT. Currently off sedation and is
   minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for
   anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- MRI with likely anoxic brain injury; possibly septic emboli though
   doesn
t have any positive blood cultures
   -- TTE to r/o vegs
   -- MVI and thiamine started empirically
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family interested in NEOB, extubation with evaluation for mental
   status improvement and possible cmo
   -- keep propofol off
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- will check c.diff
   -- cont vanco/cefepime ([**2190-12-23**]) for now which would cover sinusitis as
   well
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in setting
   of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from OSH. Blood
   glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
   -- q6h FS
   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.  Resolved; stable
   - trend LFTs, lipase
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - started lasix gtt; goal I/O -1 to -2L/day
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - hold home lisinopril
   # Hypernatremia:  resolved.
   - decrease free H2O flush to 100 q6H; can increase if needed
   # HL: cont home statin, hold ASA
   # HTN:  Holding home lisinpril giving renal failure.  Degree of
   hypertension more suggestive of central process.
   - Cont labatolol and uptitrate for goal < 140. currently well

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) and CRI (chronic renal insufficiency) who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. He has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors:

1. Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's symptoms, including altered mental status and respiratory distress, are likely due to a combination of infection (given Gram-positive cocci in the blood culture) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There is also concern for meningitis given the head CT results. The patient is currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with a poor prognosis according to the neurologist. An MRI shows concerning signs of anoxic brain injury, possibly septic emboli although there are no positive blood cultures.

2. Low-grade temps: The patient has had persistent low-grade temperatures, suggesting a central process. No clear infectious source has been identified, and the patient is still on broad-spectrum antibiotics. An MRI shows pansinusitis.

3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in DKA in the setting of ongoing lethargy reported by the family, and Gram-positive cocci were found in the blood culture from OSH (out-of-hospital setting). The patient's blood glucose has been corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt (intravenous insulin),"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT. Currently off sedation and is
   minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for
   anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- MRI with likely anoxic brain injury; possibly septic emboli though
   doesn
t have any positive blood cultures
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family interested in NEOB, extubation with evaluation for mental
   status improvement and possible cmo
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- will check c.diff
   -- cont vanco/cefepime ([**2190-12-23**]) for now which would cover sinusitis as
   well
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in setting
   of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from OSH. Blood
   glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u

   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.  Resolved; stable

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including:

1. Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's symptoms are likely due to a combination of infection (given the presence of gram-positive cocci in the bronchoalveolar lavage) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There is also concern for meningitis given the head CT findings. The patient is currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with a poor prognosis per neurologist.

2. Low Grade Temps: The patient has low-grade temperatures, suggesting a central process. No clear infectious source is present, and the patient is still on continued broad-spectrum antibiotics. An MRI reveals pansinusitis.

3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in DKA in the setting of ongoing lethargy. Blood glucose levels were corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt, and the patient was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. Sugars are now under better control.

4. Pancreatitis: The patient could have pancreatitis, which precipitated the event. Elevated amylase levels and pancreatic edema suggest this possibility. Consultation with general surgery has been made.

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and persistent altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient's family has indicated that he would not have wanted to live with minimal cognitive function. Neurological evaluation shows that the patient has extensive abnormalities on MRI, and there is a lack of improvement with no recovery of higher cerebral function. The prognosis is extremely poor.

The patient has been receiving MVI and thiamine supplementation, and blood cultures are pending. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.1°C (100.5°F). Blood pressure is within normal limits at 129/57 mmHg, heart rate is 64 bpm, respiratory rate is 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 100%. The patient's weight is currently 111.5 kg, and height is 72 inches.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 4,424 mL and total output of 4,130 mL, resulting in a balance of 294 mL. The patient has been receiving furosemide (Lasix) at a rate of 10 mg/hour. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg.

Laboratory results indicate the following: hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.6 g/dL, leukocyte (WBC"

   I have seen and examined the patient with the fellow and agree with

   Assessment:
   1-       Unresponsiveness: I thoroughly reviewed the case, reviewed the
   MRI findings with the neuroradiologist, and discussed with the
   neurology attending.  The MRI findings are most consistent with an
   anoxic injury though the patient never had full cardiac arrest.  There
   was no involvement of thalamus or other basal ganglia structures and
   thus not suggestive of WE or CO toxicity.  Also, though embolic on the
   differential, it is deemed less likely radiographically  Despite this,
   we will obtain an ECHO to see if any vegetations.  There were also
   findings on the MRI consistent with chronic microvascular disease.
   Thus, putting this altogether, I suspect that the patient had
   underlying predisposition through microvascular disease in the brain
   and the severe insult of acidosis/hypotension/hyperosmolar coma
   combined to create an anoxic injury pattern.  The prognosis is likely
   not good and we will discuss further with the family.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and altered mental status. He required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient's prognosis is poor due to extensive abnormalities on MRI and lack of recovery of higher cerebral function. The patient has been on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and cefepime, for presumed meningitis. He also receives thiamine and multivitamin supplementation. The patient has low-grade fevers, ventilator dependence, and acute renal failure. His blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and he requires ongoing management for glycemic control.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing further infections due to his immunocompromised state and prolonged ICU stay. Regular monitoring of vital signs and repeated cultures are important to identify any new infections promptly.

2. Ventilator Dependence: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation. His ability to wean off the ventilator will depend on his neurological status and respiratory function. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular reassessment of neurological status are necessary to determine the appropriate timing for extubation.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function needs close monitoring, and appropriate measures should be taken to optimize his fluid balance and urine output. Adjustments in diuretic therapy may be required to manage fluid overload and prevent further deterioration of renal function.

 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI vs embolic phenomenon (although
   neurology feels latter is unlikely as a vascular territories
   involved).
   -will talk to neurology and ID to determine: if MRI changes are related
   to embolic phenomenon, would more time on IV antibiotics lead to an
   improvement in mental status?
   -if neurology does not feel more time would give us a sense of improved
   prognosis will speak to family about extubation and placement of
   DNR/DNI status.  Patient will likely do well immediately post
   extubation as able to take in tidal volumes>1L on PS 5/5
   -empiric vancomycin and cefepime for 14 day course for presumed
   meningitis
   -TTE to rule out vegetation
   -thiamine and MVI supplementation
low grade fevers of unclear etiology
   -await repeat cultures
   -no eosinophilia to suggest drug reaction
   -will remove TLC after PICC placed today
ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -await defined neurologic status prior to decision to extubate
acute renal failure
   -will decrease free water boluses
   -monitor urine output

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and altered mental status. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support device.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 64 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 129/57 to 157/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 40%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 4,424 mL, output of 4,130 mL, and a positive balance of 294 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. The kidney function tests indicate mild elevation in creatinine levels, while liver function tests are within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are also within normal range.

The patient's imaging studies reveal extensive abnormalities on MRI, which neurology believes may be related to an anoxic brain injury or embolic phenomenon. The patient has received multiple antibiotics, including acyclovir, vancomycin, and cefepime, for presumed meningitis. Th"

   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT. Currently off sedation and is
   minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for
   anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- MRI with likely anoxic brain injury; possibly septic emboli though
   doesn

   -- MVI and thiamine started empirically
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family interested in NEOB, extubation with evaluation for mental
   status improvement and possible cmo
   -- keep propofol off
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, pancreatitis, acute on chronic renal failure, hypernatremia, hypertension, and altered mental status. The patient is currently receiving various treatments and medications in the ICU, including diuretics, insulin, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and renal replacement therapy. The family is considering extubation and focusing on comfort measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Brain Injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and MRI findings suggest a hypoxic brain injury, which can lead to long-term neurological deficits and disability.
2. Low-Grade Temps: The presence of persistent low-grade temperatures may indicate an underlying central process such as an infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient's hyperglycemia and hyperosmolaremia can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS). Proper glycemic control is crucial to prevent these complications.

   60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
   seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve appears structurally normal
   with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. The pulmonary artery
   systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial
   effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT. Currently off sedation and is
   minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neuro.  MRI concerning for
   anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH initially)
   -- CSF- no growth
   -- MRI with likely anoxic brain injury; possibly septic emboli though
   doesn
t have any positive blood cultures
   -- TTE to r/o vegs
   -- MVI and thiamine started empirically
   -- neuro and ID recs
   -- family interested in NEOB, extubation with evaluation for mental
   status improvement and possible cmo
   -- keep propofol off
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- will check c.diff
   -- cont vanco/cefepime ([**2190-12-23**]) for now which would cover sinusitis as
   well
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in setting
   of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from OSH. Blood
   glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- increased lantus to 22u

   # Pancreatitis:  CT scan w/o contrast of little utility.  Could see
   such a picture in DKA, but additionally could have pancreatitis which
   precipitated event.  With elevated amylase and pancreatic edema, c/s
   general surgery.  Agree with current manegment and will continue to
   follow.  Resolved; stable

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI vs embolic phenomenon (although
   neurology feels latter is unlikely as all vascular territories
   involved).
   -no improvement in his mental status, propofol off for 48 hours now
   -family appears to understand there is a minor chance of recovery of
   cognitive function given that we have little clinical experience with
   brain injury due to severe acidosis.  However, they do not want to risk
   a persistent vegetative state
   -plan for extubation on [**Year (4 digits) 511**]
   -in the interim continue meningitis coverage
   -hold sedatives
low grade fevers of unclear etiology
   -await repeat cultures
   -no eosinophilia to suggest drug reaction
   -given family
s decision to likely withdraw care on [**Year (4 digits) 511**] will hold on
   PICC placement now
ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -extubation [**Year (4 digits) 511**] as above
acute renal failure
   -increase lasix drip for goal out 1-2L daily
   -continue lantus and RISS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type I who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has been unresponsive since admission, and an MRI of the brain shows evidence of anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis and ketosis.

The patient's vital signs remain relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 150/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. The neurologic examination shows that the patient's eyes are open but there is no blinking or response to threats or pain.

Laboratory results indicate hyperglycemia, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and elevated troponin-T. All cultures are negative.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to have suffered anoxic brain injury, likely due to hypotension at the onset of symptoms. There is a minor chance of recovery of cognitive function, but the family does not want to risk persistent vegetative state.
2. Ventilator Dependence: The patient is currently dependent on the ventilator due to altered mental status.

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI vs embolic phenomenon (although
   neurology feels latter is unlikely as a vascular territories
   involved).
   -will talk to neurology and ID to determine: if MRI changes are related
   to embolic phenomenon, would more time on IV antibiotics lead to an
   improvement in mental status?
   -if neurology does not feel more time would give us a sense of improved
   prognosis will speak to family about extubation and placement of
   DNR/DNI status.  Patient will likely do well immediately post
   extubation as able to take in tidal volumes>1L on PS 5/5
   -empiric vancomycin and cefepime for 14 day course for presumed
   meningitis
   -TTE to rule out vegetation
   -thiamine and MVI supplementation
low grade fevers of unclear etiology
   -await repeat cultures
   -no eosinophilia to suggest drug reaction
   -will remove TLC after PICC placed today
ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -await defined neurologic status prior to decision to extubate
acute renal failure
   -will decrease free water boluses
   -monitor urine output
   -increase lasix drip for goal out 1-2L daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type I, admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has persistent unresponsiveness, and an MRI brain is consistent with anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis and ketosis. The patient has a history of recent placement of an insulin pump.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator dependence due to altered mental status: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and it is unclear when he will be able to breathe independently. This will depend on his neurological status improving.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidney function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and adjustment of diuretic medication (lasix) will be necessary to manage this condition.
3. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics (cefepime and vancomycin) for presumed meningitis. Repeat cultures are pending to determine if there is an ongoing infection. Low-grade fevers may suggest an underlying infection.
4. Thiamine deficiency: Patients with diabetes are at risk for thiamine deficiency. Thiamine supplementation should be considered to prevent Wernicke encephalopathy.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing blood clots due to immobility and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures should be taken to prevent DVT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type I and recent placement of insulin pump, admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and high blood sugar levels. He has persistent unresponsiveness and MRI brain findings consistent with anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis and ketosis. The family has agreed to extubation on [**Year (4 digits) 511**]. The patient remains afebrile, without vegetations on transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE), and no known drug allergies. The patient is currently receiving various medications including furosemide, heparin sodium, chlorhexadine, labetalol, Lantus, and RISS. He is also receiving nutrition through Nutren 2.0 at 40 mL/hour.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness and MRI findings indicate a potential anoxic brain injury. There is a minor chance of recovery of cognitive function, but the family does not want to risk persistent vegetative state.
2. Ventilator Dependence: Due to the altered mental status, the patient is ventilator-dependent. Extubation is planned on [**Year (4 digits) 511**].
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, and the plan is to increase the lasix drip for a goal output of 1-2 liters daily.
4. Infection: Despite being on prophylactic antibiotics, the patient has low-grade fevers of unclear etiology. Repeat cultures are pending, and there is no evidence of eosinophilia to suggest a drug reaction.
5. Possible Withdrawal of Care: Given the family's decision to likely withdraw care on [**Year (4 digits) 511**], the plan is to hold off on PICC placement now.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and treatment plan for the patient."

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI vs embolic phenomenon (although
   neurology feels latter is unlikely as all vascular territories
   involved).
   -no improvement in his mental status, propofol off for 48 hours now
   -family appears to understand there is a minor chance of recovery of
   cognitive function given that we have little clinical experience with
   brain injury due to severe acidosis.  However, they do not want to risk
   a persistent vegetative state
   -plan for extubation on [**Year (4 digits) 511**]
   -in the interim continue meningitis coverage
   -hold sedatives
low grade fevers of unclear etiology
   -await repeat cultures
   -no eosinophilia to suggest drug reaction
   -given family
s decision to likely withdraw care on [**Year (4 digits) 511**] will hold on
   PICC placement now
ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -extubation [**Year (4 digits) 511**] as above
acute renal failure
   -increase lasix drip for goal out 1-2L daily
   -continue lantus and RISS

   Total time spent:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with diabetes mellitus type 1 who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and currently unresponsive with an MRI brain consistent with anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis and ketosis. The patient has persistent unresponsiveness and is on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 151/56 mmHg to 122/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 111.5 kg and height is 72 inches.

The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics including cefipime and vancomycin, and is currently on furosemide infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications such as chlorhexadine, labetalol, Lantus, and RISS.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for recent placement of insulin pump. The flow sheet data shows ongoing fluid balance, hemodynamic monitoring, and respiratory support.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, bilateral lower extremity edema, and neurologic exam showing eyes open but no blinking to threat, no grimace or withdrawal to pain.

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results show elevated troponin-T and CK-MB levels, elevated amylase and lipase levels, and electrolyte imbalances.

The patient's imaging studies include an MRI brain showing findings consistent with anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis and ketosis.

The assessment and plan include altered mental status due to hypotension and subsequent anoxic brain injury or embolic phenomenon. The patient's family has agreed to extubation on [**Year (4 digits) 511**] and withdrawal of care. The patient will continue with meningitis coverage, hold sedatives, await repeat cultures, and monitor for low-grade fevers. Ventilator dependence is noted due to altered mental status, and the patient may require extubation on [**Year (4 digits) 511**]. Acute renal failure is also present, and the plan is to increase lasix drip for goal out 1-2L daily."

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT, but cultures remained negative.
   Currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with poor prognosis
   per neuro.  MRI concerning for anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH
   initially)
   -- likely withdraw care on Friday based on family
s wishes
   -- continue to f/u culture data and supportive care

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (likely Type 1 diabetes mellitus) and CRI (chronic renal insufficiency). The patient presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. He was found to have hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, likely due to a combination of infection (given the presence of GPCs in blood cultures) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). There is also concern for meningitis, but cultures remained negative.

The patient is currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with poor prognosis according to neurologic assessment. An MRI revealed anoxic brain injury, which is consistent with the hypotensive state at OSH initially. Based on family wishes, withdrawal of care is recommended by Friday.

Other medical complications and ongoing assessments include:

1. Low-grade temperatures: The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures, most likely due to a central process. No clear infectious source is present, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued. An MRI with pansinusitis was noted, and blood/urine/sputum cultures are being followed up. CSF cultures have been negative, and vancomycin/cefepime coverage has been continued.

2. Hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in DKA and now has GPCs in the blood culture from OSH. Blood glucose"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of DKA and altered mental status. He was admitted with DKA and is now likely experiencing anoxic brain injury or injury from severe acidosis. The patient's condition has been monitored closely in the ICU. Notable events include FSG of 500s covered with sliding scale insulin, use of antibiotics, and various infusions and medications. The patient's vital signs have been stable, with some fluctuations in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,882 mL and output of 5,420 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,538 mL. The patient is on ventilator support and has respiratory parameters within normal ranges. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, and right and left lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows no blink to threat and withdrawing to pain when lower extremities are pinched. Laboratory results indicate elevated glucose levels, high WBC count, low Hct, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal range. The patient's family understands the minor chance of recovery of cognitive function but does not want to risk persistent vegetative state. The plan is to discuss continuation of care with the family tomorrow. The patient's condition is being managed with appropriate ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis, and medication administration.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with diabetic mellitus who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now likely suffering from anoxic brain injury or injury due to severe acidosis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, blood pressure ranging from 138/57mmHg to 143/57mmHg, heart rate of 65 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, the patient shows no response to threat, withdrawal to pain, and grimacing to ear pinching. The patient's laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit, and abnormal liver function tests.

The patient's conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to have suffered anoxic brain injury, as indicated by MRI findings. There has been some improvement in the neurologic exam with response to noxious stimuli. The family is considering withdrawing care on Friday if there is no significant improvement.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on ventilator support due to altered mental status. Extubation is planned for Friday."

   Assessment and Plan
 Altered Mental Status
 Appears to have been hypotensive at OSH and
   suffered anoxic brain injury by MRI vs embolic phenomenon (although
   neurology feels latter is unlikely as all vascular territories
   involved).
   -no improvement in his mental status, propofol off for 48 hours now
   -family appears to understand there is a minor chance of recovery of
   cognitive function given that we have little clinical experience with
   brain injury due to severe acidosis.  However, they do not want to risk
   a persistent vegetative state
   -plan for extubation on Friday
   -in the interim continue meningitis coverage
   -hold sedatives
low grade fevers of unclear etiology
   -await repeat cultures
   -no eosinophilia to suggest drug reaction
   -given family
s decision to likely withdraw care on Friday will hold on
   PICC placement now
ventilator dependence due to altered mental status
   -extubation Friday as above
acute renal failure
   -increase lasix drip for goal out 1-2L daily
   -continue lantus and RISS

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old man with a history of depression and medication overdose admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and altered mental status. The patient's condition has been monitored closely, with regular assessments and interventions.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Persistent vegetative state: The family has expressed their decision to likely withdraw care on Friday due to the minor chance of recovery of cognitive function. This could lead to the patient remaining in a persistent vegetative state.

2. Ventilator dependence: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to altered mental status. Extubation is planned for Friday, but the patient may continue to require ventilator support.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, as indicated by elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. The plan is to increase the lasix drip for a goal output of 1-2 liters daily and continue with ongoing management.

4. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient has low-grade fevers of unclear etiology. Repeat cultures are pending to determine if there is an ongoing infection that requires further treatment.

5. Malnutrition: The patient is receiving Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 40 mL/hour to provide adequate nutrition. This is important to prevent malnutrition, which can worsen overall health and recovery"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and subsequent anoxic brain injury. The patient is currently comatose and requires intubation. The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy placement and is unable to have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) due to overlying colon, with plans to place PEG in the operating room on Monday. The patient is receiving sedation with propofol for tracheostomy placement. 

The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient received cefepime and vancomycin for presumed meningitis, but the fever has resolved. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 115/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurologic examination shows altered mental status, but no acute distress or focal neurologic deficits.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and renal insufficiency. Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient's renal function is being managed with furosemide, and the plan is to transition from a continuous infusion to intermittent dosing. The patient will continue with l"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM1), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and recent insulin pump placement. He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute on chronic renal failure, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypertension, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:

1. Hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy: This condition can lead to permanent neurological damage and impaired cognitive function.

2. Low-grade temperatures: Persistent low-grade fever may indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process, which could potentially worsen if not appropriately managed.

3. Hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to further complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), or both. These conditions require immediate medical attention and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's underlying renal dysfunction may be exacerbated by factors such as dehydration or nephrotoxic medications. This can result in further deterioration of renal function, potentially leading to acute kidney injury (AKI) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

5. Pancreatitis"

The patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.

The patient underwent several procedures and interventions, including percutaneous tracheostomy, multi-lumen central venous catheter placement, and placement of a PICC line. The patient also received blood cultures and had various lab tests done.

The patient's condition was complicated by several medical complications, including hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar state, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypertension, and potential medication-related issues (HL and HTN).

The patient's current status is as follows:
- Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube.
- Cardiovascular: The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits.
- Neurologic: The patient is minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neurologic evaluation.
- Renal: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, likely due to diabetic nephropathy and volume depletion.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) who presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient was found to have profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient underwent percutaneous tracheostomy and was placed on mechanical ventilation. The tracheostomy was performed without difficulty, and a PICC line was also placed. However, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) could not be done in the ICU and will be performed in the operating room on Monday.

The patient has a history of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) with a creatinine level of 2.3. There are concerns about hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy due to the combination of infection and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Meningitis is also a concern, but cultures have remained negative.

The patient's low-grade temperatures are most likely due to a central process, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued. An MRI with pansinusitis is planned to further evaluate the source of the fever.

The patient's hyperglycemia/hyperosmolar state was managed by correcting blood glucose levels with insulin gtt and transitioning to subcutaneous insulin. Basal glucose and HISS (home insulin secretion study) have been continued.

The patient's acute renal failure is likely secondary to diabetic nephropathy, with acute"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1, recent insulin pump placement, and chronic renal insufficiency who presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status. He was found to have profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypertension, and ineffective coping.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 140/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose level is within normal range, but there are abnormalities in electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and phosphorus levels. Other lab values including BUN, creatinine, liver enzymes, and lipase are also abnormal.

The patient has a tracheostomy in place and is being weaned off sedation. He is minimally responsive with poor prognosis per neurology. The patient is withdrawing to pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include seizure, hypertension, pancreatitis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT, but cultures remained negative.
   Currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with poor prognosis
   per neuro.  MRI concerning for anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH
   initially).  Now ?withdrawing to pain.
   -- trach placed, attempt to wean to pressure support, trach collar
   -- continue to f/u culture data and supportive care
   -- neuro and id reccs
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- cont vanco/cefepime ([**2190-12-23**]) likely for 14 day course for
   meningitis though low suspicion
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in setting
   of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from OSH. Blood
   glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- increase lantus to 24u
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
   -- q6h FS
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) and chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. 

The patient's current conditions include hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, and hypertension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ineffective coping, such as airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), seizure with status epilepticus, hypertension (benign), pancreatitis, acute renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), and hyperglycemia.

The patient's current ICU care includes nutrition support with Nutren 2.0 (full), glycemic control, lines such as a PICC line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with subcutaneous unfractionated heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions, and code status of do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics, blood transfusion, and adjustments to fluid and medication regimens. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but there are concerns regarding ineffective coping, airway management, seizure activity, hypertension, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, hyperglycemia, and altered mental status. The patient is receiving nutritional support through a feeding tube and has multiple lines inserted for medication administration. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers have been implemented. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) and do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective Coping: The patient may experience psychological distress or difficulty coping with their current health condition, which can affect their overall well-being.
2. Airway Management: The patient's inability to protect their airway increases the risk of aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance, potentially leading to respiratory complications.
3. Seizure Activity: The patient has a history of seizure activity, which may recur and require appropriate management to prevent further complications.
4. Hypertension: The patient's elevated blood pressure indicates hypertension, which if left uncontrolled, can lead to cardiovascular complications.
5. Acute Pancreatitis: The patient is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, a"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1, recent insulin pump placement, CRI, and presentation in respiratory distress and altered mental status. The patient has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. There are concerns for hypoxic brain injury, meningitis, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia, acute-on-chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, and hypertension. The patient is currently minimally responsive with poor prognosis, withdrawing to pain, and has tracheostomy placement. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, insulin gtt, sc insulin, and other supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and respiratory distress may lead to further neurological damage if not managed properly.
2. Infection/Meningitis: Despite negative cultures, the patient's symptoms suggest possible infection or meningitis. Continued monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary.
3. Acute-on-chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function may worsen due to volume depletion and hyperosmolar state. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood glucose levels need to be controlled through insulin therapy to prevent further complications.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed with transfusions and further evaluation.
6. Pancreatitis: Although the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, recent insulin pump placement, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues including hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypertension, and ineffective coping.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure, with status epilepticus: The patient has had a seizure and is at risk for developing status epilepticus.
2. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, it is important to monitor and manage blood pressure levels to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac issues.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a risk of further deterioration, which can lead to complications such as fluid overload, electrolyte imbalances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored and managed to prevent complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis, infections, and poor wound healing.
5. Ineffective airway clearance: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired air"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a 52 year old male with a history of DM1 with a recent
   insulin pump placement, CRI (Cr 2.3) who presented in respiratory
   distress and altered mental status, found to have profound
   hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis.
   # Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy:  Precipitating symptoms likely
   from a combination of infection given GPCs in bcx and DKA.  Also
   concern for meningitis given head CT, but cultures remained negative.
   Currently off sedation and is minimally responsive with poor prognosis
   per neuro.  MRI concerning for anoxic brain injury (hypotensive at OSH
   initially).  Now ?withdrawing to pain.
   -- trach placed, attempt to wean to pressure support, trach collar
   -- continue to f/u culture data and supportive care
   -- neuro and id reccs
   # Low Grade Temps: most likely central process.  No clear infectious
   source present, and still on continued broad spectrum antibiotics. MRI
   with pansinusitis
   -- f/u blood/urine/sputum cultures
   -- CSF cultures negative
   -- cont vanco/cefepime ([**2190-12-23**]) likely for 14 day course for
   meningitis though low suspicion (last day [**1-6**])
   #  Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia:  Patient presented in DKA in setting
   of ongoing lethargy by family and now with GPCs in BCx from OSH. Blood
   glucose corrected in first 24 hrs with insulin gtt, and was
   transitioned to sc insulin.  Sugars are now under better control.
   -- cont basal glucose and HISS
   -- [**Last Name (un) 303**] recs
   -- q6h FS
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Likely underlying renal dysfunction
   from diabetic nephropathy.  Suspect acute worsening from volume
   depletion in the setting of hyperosmolar state.  Muddy brown casts c/w
   ATN
   - f/u renal recs
   - hold on Lasix bolus for now given worsening renal failure
   - avoid nephrotoxic meds
   - 5 pm lytes
   # Anemia: Has anemia of chronic inflammation and likely marrow
   suppression.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of DM1 (diabetes mellitus type 1) who presented with respiratory distress and altered mental status. He has profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient is currently off sedation and minimally responsive with a poor prognosis per neurologist. MRI findings suggest anoxic brain injury.

The patient's medical conditions include hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, pancreatitis, hypernatremia, hypertension, and ineffective coping.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure and is at risk for status epilepticus.
2. Inability to protect airway: The patient has an altered gag reflex and impaired airway clearance, putting him at risk for aspiration.
3. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may require dialysis and careful management of fluid and electrolyte balance.
4. Infection: Despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient still has a risk of developing infections, especially considering his altered immune response due to diabetes.
5. Pressure ulcers: The patient is at risk for developing pressure ulcers due to immobility.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with DKA and altered mental status.
- The patient was found to have suffered anoxic brain injury, possibly due to hypotension at OSH or embolic phenomenon.
- The patient is currently ventilator-dependent due to altered mental status.
- There are concerns about a potential line infection, but the patient's fevers have resolved.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is receiving lasix drip to manage fluid output.
- The patient's glycemic control and nutrition are being closely monitored.
- The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is dependent on the ventilator, there is a risk of developing pneumonia due to prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and altered mental status increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins, which could lead to a potentially life-threatening condition if they travel to the lungs.
3. Stress ulcer: The patient's altered mental status and ICU stay may increase the risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum, which can bleed.
4. Line infection: The presence of multiple lines and catheters increases the risk of infection, particularly if proper hygiene and care are not maintained.
5. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's acute renal failure may progress to AKI, which can"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU and has experienced several events over the past 24 hours. These include PEG placement, myoclonic jerks after the procedure, persistent hypernatremia despite fluid resuscitation, and worsening renal function. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Vital signs include a temperature of 99.2°F, blood pressure of 134/58 mmHg, pulse rate of 60 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema, non-tender abdomen, and wincing to pain without movement of extremities. Laboratory results show elevated glucose levels, increased white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's altered mental status is attributed to anoxic brain injury, likely caused by hypotension at the onset of symptoms. The patient is also diagnosed with acute on chronic renal failure, and plans include completing a course of antibiotics for presumed meningitis, attempting weaning from mechanical ventilation, and considering a trial of therapeutic hypothermia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he will require planning for discharge."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old man with a chief complaint of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis) and altered mental status. He has a history of prolonged acidosis vs anoxic brain injury. The patient underwent PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) placement and experienced myoclonic jerks, which were reported to neurology. He also has persistent hypernatremia despite being febrile.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/48 mmHg to 144/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 9 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 111.5 kg, and his height is 72 inches.

The patient's labs show a glucose level of 104 mg/dL, sodium level of 148 mEq/L, potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride level of 40 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 23.2%, BUN level of 47 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.8 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 228 K/uL. The patient's white blood cell count ranges from 11.5 to 6.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level ranges from 24.5 to 21.7 g/dL, and platelet count ranges from 271 to 281 K/uL.

The patient's respiratory support includes an oxygen delivery device of tracheostomy tube, ventilator mode of MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 8 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen of 40%.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient appears to have suffered anoxic brain injury, possibly due to hypotension at the onset of symptoms or an embolic phenomenon. Myoclonic jerks were noted but are believed to be related to medications received during PEG placement. If persistent, an EEG may be considered. A complete course of vancomycin and cefepime is being given empirically for meningitis. Ventilator dependence is due to altered mental status, and after resolution of myoclonic jerks, a TCM trial will be attempted.
2. Acute on Chronic RF: Lasix will be held for today, and renal comments will be requested. Lantus and clinic follow-up will continue.
3. ICU Care: Nutrition will be resumed through tube feeds, and glycemic control will be monitored. Lines include a PICC line placed on 12/31. Prophylaxis measures include DVT prevention with he"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, likely due to a combination of infection and diabetic ketoacidosis. He is currently minimally responsive with a poor prognosis. The patient also has anemia, hypernatremia, hypertension, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective airway clearance: The patient's inability to protect his airway increases the risk of aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance.
2. Seizure: The patient has had a seizure and is at risk for status epilepticus.
3. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is currently well-controlled, it may still pose a risk.
4. Pancreatitis: The patient has acute pancreatitis, which can lead to complications such as abdominal pain, inflammation, and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which can worsen his pre-existing chronic renal insufficiency and result in further kidney damage.
6. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium or other cognitive impairments.
7. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels can lead to diabetic"

","The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1, recent insulin pump placement, chronic renal insufficiency (Cr 2.3), and a current admission for respiratory distress, altered mental status, profound hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoxic brain injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's presentation with respiratory distress and altered mental status may have caused a hypoxic brain injury, leading to encephalopathy.
2. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms and head CT findings raised concerns for meningitis, although cultures remained negative.
3. Anoxic brain injury: The presence of myotonic jerks raises concern for anoxic brain injury, especially considering the hypotensive episode at OSH initially.
4. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is at risk for hyperglycemia and hyperosmolaremia.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal failure. The recent episode of overdiuresis may have exacerbated the condition.
6. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit, which needs to be corrected once total fluid intake is resumed.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia of chronic inflammation and likely marrow suppression"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis). The patient underwent a PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) procedure and is currently receiving various medications including labetalol, peridex, insulin, famotidine, colace, vancomycin, and cefepime. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 132/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and diffuse anasarca. Neurologically, the patient is unresponsive with non-purposeful movements and increased muscle tone. Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging reveals clear chest X-rays. The patient's airway management is complicated due to an inability to protect it, and there is a risk of aspiration. The patient also has acute renal failure that has not improved following a fluid challenge. The patient's mental status remains altered, and hyperglycemia is being monitored. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient underwent a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure. Allergies, last doses of antibiotics, and current infusions are documented. There are no known drug allergies. The patient's vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and neurologic status are provided. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obesity. Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, tracheostomy, clear lung fields, right and left lower extremity edema, diffuse anasarca, stiff digits due to edema, warm skin with rashes on posterior calves and flanks, and unresponsiveness with non-purposeful movement. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose, creatinine, BUN, and lactate levels, along with other abnormalities. Imaging and previous lab values are also noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged endotracheal tube placement.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and lower extremity edema.
3. Nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI) or wound infections from the PEG procedure.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or chronic kidney disease (CK"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, along with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has been diagnosed with ineffective coping, airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration), seizure with status epilepticus, hypertension, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, altered mental status (not delirium), and hyperglycemia.

Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxic Brain Injury/Encephalopathy: The patient's symptoms are likely due to a combination of infection (given GPCs in bcx) and DKA. There is also concern for meningitis given the head CT, but cultures remained negative. The patient is minimally responsive with a poor prognosis per neuro. MRI shows anoxic brain injury.

2. Hyperglycemia/Hyperosmolaremia: The patient presented in DKA in the setting of ongoing lethargy by family. Blood glucose was corrected in the first 24 hours with insulin gtt, and then transitioned to sc insulin. Sugars are now under better control.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: Renal failure has been identified due to elevated creatinine levels. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage it, such as holding lasix, continuing 1/2NS@100"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type 1 and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented in respiratory distress and altered mental status, with profound hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis. The patient has multiple medical complications, including ineffective coping, airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration), seizure with status epilepticus, hypertension, acute pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic brain injury/encephalopathy, low-grade temperatures, hyperglycemia/hyperosmolaremia, acute on chronic renal failure, anemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, and hyperphosphatemia. The patient is also on various medications, including insulin, heparin sodium, famotidine, and others.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory distress, further deterioration in mental status, progression of acute renal failure, and development of additional infections. Close monitoring and management of the patient's airway, respiratory support, fluid balance, electrolyte levels, and medication administration will be crucial in preventing and managing these potential complications."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. The following potential medical complications can arise:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is a risk of continued respiratory failure or the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is a risk of worsening renal function or the development of chronic kidney disease.

3. Anoxic Brain Injury: The patient has an anoxic brain injury, which may lead to long-term neurological deficits or persistent vegetative state.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has lower extremity edema, which increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylactic measures such as subcutaneous heparin are being used.

5. Pressure Ulcers: The patient's immobility increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers.

6. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections, especially since they are on prolonged mechanical ventilation and have a compromised immune system.

7. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has a G-tube, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

8. Cardiac Complications: The patient's cardiovascular status should be closely monitored for any signs of cardiac complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure.

It is crucial to closely monitor the patient's"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving antibiotics, specifically cefepime and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs remain stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/55 to 149/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight has increased from 107.5 kg at admission to 111.5 kg currently. Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,320 mL, output of 1,600 mL, and a positive balance of 1,720 mL since 92 AM. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube with ventilator mode set at MMV/PSV/AutoFlow, with a tidal volume of 500 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 15 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 38. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normocephalic head, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, tender abdomen around the gastrostomy tube, and bilateral lower extremity edema.
