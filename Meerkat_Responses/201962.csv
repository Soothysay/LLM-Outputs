   Chest xray from this morning (my read): evidence of volume overload,
   more than yesterday
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence on imaging or direct
   observation during ENT surgery. There was initially concern for
   bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted blood seen by
   IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of
   bleeding from tonsils or GI source. Currently doing well on PS
   - Continue on PS vent setting, plan to extubated later this afternoon
   - wean down propofol and fentanyl
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 now, need to diurese her before attempting to
   extubate as pt is volume overloaded which makes extubation difficult in
   this chronic COPDer
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot with copious irrigation. No
   active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any, symptoms patient may have
   had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes,
   she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID per family she has been
   taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put her at higher risk for
   peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also being worked up for SCC
   malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach, however she could have
   esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD in esophagus). Other
   possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion. Per GI team, it does
   not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was from tonsilar or
   upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow q12 HCT's
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - extubated today
   - can advance to clear liquids later today after extubation
   - Keep NG tube to low intermittent suction, per discussion with GI,
   mainly to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: Suspected to be SCC, unknown primary. Being
   followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8796**] in oncology.
   - Follow up final pathology reports
   - Further diagnosis and work-up per oncology and ENT teams
   - Continue antibiotics per ENT for now
   - Follow up with ENT re: removal of sutures,  check if sutures are
   absorbable/non-absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN, fentanyl on ventilator
   .
   #) HIV: Continue home medications, however there are no IV
   substitutes.. Last viral load was undetectable.
   - F/u with patient
s HIV physician if has to miss today
s dose after
   extubation
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications. Per outpatient notes, patient has been referred for lung
   transplant evaluation.

","The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She presents to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after a biopsy of a right neck mass and tonsil. 

Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and evaluation of bleeding etiology.
- She has a large right-sided neck mass, but there is no evidence of bleeding from the airway based on imaging or direct observation during the ENT surgery.
- The initial concern for bleeding in the airway was due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or a GI source.
- The patient is on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is doing well. The plan is to wean down propofol and fentanyl.
- Lasix 20mg IV x 1 was given to diurese the patient before attempting extubation, as she is volume overloaded.
- The patient's home COPD medications (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva) are to be continued, with no evidence of exacerbation at present.
- Hematemesis occurred, and repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a clot in the gastric cardia, which could not be dislodged with irrigation. No active bleeding was noted.
- The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which puts her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis.

   Chest xray from this morning (my read): right middle lobe infiltrate, ?
   aspiration after vomiting blood in the OR
   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence on imaging or direct
   observation during ENT surgery. There was initially concern for
   bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted blood seen by
   IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of
   bleeding from tonsils or GI source.
   - Continue on AC overnight, titrating down oxygen as tolerated and
   following ABG's; will plan to place a-line. Will likely go down on rate
   to avoid air-trapping given severe COPD
   - Continue propofol for now, would consider switch to versed/fentanyl
   if extubation appears to be delayed after repeat EGD
   - Follow up AM chest x-ray, as most recent one does not demonstrate any
   consolidation
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   - Will consider diuresis as she stabalizes to help move towards
   extubation, monitor I/O
s carefully
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Unclear what, if any, symptoms patient may have had
   prior to events today. Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes, she

   notes), so this would put her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease
   and gastritis. She is also being worked up for SCC malignancy, which
   would be rare in the stomach, however she could have esophageal SCC
   (though nothing reported on EGD in esophagus). Other possibilities
   include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion. Per GI team, it does not appear that
   the clot noted in her stomach was from tonsilar or upper respiratory
   tract source. No active bleeding noted.
   - Follow q8 HCT's

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of HIV and COPD, presenting to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after a biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil. She is intubated for airway protection and evaluation of bleeding etiology. The initial concern for airway bleeding has been ruled out, and the clotted blood seen during bronchoscopy was likely due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or a GI source.

The patient is being treated for respiratory failure, hematemesis, right-sided neck mass, and HIV. She has been taking ibuprofen, which puts her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. The cause of hematemesis is unclear, but possibilities include peptic ulcer disease, esophageal SCC, AVM, or Dieulfoy's lesion. A repeat EGD is planned tomorrow, and the NG tube will be kept to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding.

The patient's right-sided neck mass is suspected to be squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), unknown primary, and is being followed by oncologists. Further diagnosis and work-up are being conducted by the oncology and ENT teams. The patient's HIV is being managed with home medications, and her COPD is being treated with home medications as well. She has been referred for lung transplant evaluation.

ICU care includes nutrition via NG tube, glycemic control without insulin currently, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence on imaging or direct
   observation during ENT surgery. There was initially concern for
   bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted blood seen by
   IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of
   bleeding from tonsils or GI source.
   - Continue on AC overnight, titrating down oxygen as tolerated and
   following ABG's; will plan to place a-line. Will likely go down on rate
   to avoid air-trapping given severe COPD
   - Continue propofol for now, would consider switch to versed/fentanyl
   if extubation appears to be delayed after repeat EGD
   - Follow up AM chest x-ray, as most recent one does not demonstrate any
   consolidation
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   - Will consider diuresis as she stabalizes to help move towards
   extubation, monitor I/O
s carefully
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Unclear what, if any, symptoms patient may have had
   prior to events today. Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes, she
   had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID, including this morning [**Name8 (MD) 77**] RN
   notes), so this would put her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease
   and gastritis. She is also being worked up for SCC malignancy, which
   would be rare in the stomach, however she could have esophageal SCC
   (though nothing reported on EGD in esophagus). Other possibilities
   include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion. Per GI team, it does not appear that
   the clot noted in her stomach was from tonsilar or upper respiratory
   tract source. No active bleeding noted.
   - Follow q12 HCT's
   - Keep NG tube to low intermittent suction, per discussion with GI,
   mainly to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient to remain intubated and plan is for repeat EGD tomorrow
   - [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - Will discuss further with GI team potential benefit of erythromycin
   in setting of suspected upper GI Bleed
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: Suspected to be SCC, unknown primary. Being
   followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8796**] in oncology.
   - Follow up final pathology reports
   - Further diagnosis and work-up per oncology and ENT teams
   - Continue antibiotics per ENT for now
   - Follow up with ENT re: removal of sutures
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN, may also switch to fentanyl for
   bolus pain control while intubated
   - Check if sutures are absorbable/non-absorbable
   .
   #) HIV: Continue home medications, however there are no IV
   substitutes.. Last viral load was undetectable.
   - F/u with patient
s ID physician
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications. Per outpatient notes, patient has been referred for lung
   transplant evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [Known lastname] is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after undergoing a biopsy of a right neck mass and tonsil. The patient is currently intubated due to respiratory failure and airway protection.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated for both airway protection and further evaluation of bleeding etiology. She has severe COPD, and there is a concern about air-trapping leading to respiratory failure. The plan is to continue on AC overnight, titrating down oxygen as tolerated, and following ABG's. A chest x-ray will be followed up to monitor any consolidation.

2. Hematemesis: The cause of hematemesis is unclear. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which puts her at a higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also being worked up for SCC malignancy, which could involve the stomach or esophagus. Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion. The patient's HCT's will be monitored every 12 hours, and an NG tube will be kept in place for low intermittent suction to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding. If evidence of bleeding reoccurs, the GI team will be called urgently, and IR embolization may be considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence on imaging or direct
   observation during ENT surgery. There was initially concern for
   bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted blood seen by
   IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of
   bleeding from tonsils or GI source. Currently doing well on PS
   - Continue on PS vent setting, plan to extubated later this afternoon
   - wean down propofol and fentanyl
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 now, need to diurese her before attempting to
   extubate as pt is volume overloaded which makes extubation difficult in
   this chronic COPDer
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot with copious irrigation. No
   active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any, symptoms patient may have
   had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and outpatient pulmonary notes,
   she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID per family she has been
   taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put her at higher risk for
   peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also being worked up for SCC
   malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach, however she could have
   esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD in esophagus). Other
   possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion. Per GI team, it does
   not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was from tonsilar or
   upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow q12 HCT's
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - extubated today
   - can advance to clear liquids later today after extubation
   - Keep NG tube to low intermittent suction, per discussion with GI,
   mainly to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: Suspected to be SCC, unknown primary. Being
   followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8796**] in oncology.
   - Follow up final pathology reports
   - Further diagnosis and work-up per oncology and ENT teams
   - Continue antibiotics per ENT for now
   - Follow up with ENT re: removal of sutures,  check if sutures are
   absorbable/non-absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN, fentanyl on ventilator
   .
   #) HIV: Continue home medications, however there are no IV
   substitutes.. Last viral load was undetectable.
   - F/u with patient
s HIV physician if has to miss today
s dose after
   extubation
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications. Per outpatient notes, patient has been referred for lung
   transplant evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and COPD who was admitted to the ICU for further management of hematemesis following a biopsy of a right neck mass and tonsil. She is intubated due to respiratory failure and for airway protection. The initial concern for bleeding in the airway has been ruled out, and the clotted blood observed during bronchoscopy was likely due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or a GI source. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is expected to be extubated later in the afternoon. She will be weaned off propofol and fentanyl soon. Lasix 20mg IV will be administered to diurese her before attempting extubation as she is volume overloaded, which makes extubation difficult in chronic COPD.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is doing well on PS vent settings, and there are plans to extubate her later this afternoon. She will be weaned down from propofol and fentanyl, and Lasix 20mg IV will be given now to diurese her before attempting extubation. This is necessary due to volume overload, which makes extubation challenging in chronic COPD. She will continue on home COPD medications, and no evidence of exacerbation is present at present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva).

2. Hematemesis: The repeat EGD showed"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK):  Transient in the OR, transiently on
   pressors. Hemodynamically stable in ICU overnight.
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH):  Remains intubated given hematemesis x 2.  No
   further evidence of active bleeding.
 CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD, BRONCHITIS, EMPHYSEMA)
   WITH ACUTE EXACERBATION:  In anticipation of extubation will give 20 mg
   IV lasix given positive fluid balance and likely increased venous
   return when coming off positive pressure in a patient with known
   underlying severe COPD.
 HEMATEMESIS (UPPER GI BLEED, UGIB):  Most likely source seems to be
   GI.  Still unable to visualize given adherent clot.  Recommendation per
   GI is to continue PPI, extubate when awake, follow serial hcts.  Guaiac
   stools.
 ANEMIA SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS:  As above.
 HIV:  Holding po meds for now.  Reassured family and patient that
   missing few doses in light of recent GIB is preferable.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient presents with hematemesis and a right-sided neck mass (SCCa) undergoing biopsy. The patient has been intubated due to hematemesis and remains intubated with invasive ventilation. The patient has been receiving propofol and fentanyl for sedation and pain management.

The patient's vital signs show relative hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the high 80s to low 90s. The patient has been transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) due to a significant drop in hemoglobin concentration from 33 to 28.

The patient's respiratory support consists of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's respiratory system compliance is 50 cmH2O/mL, and plateau pressure is 18 cmH2O.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.36, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 58 mmHg, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 194. The patient's white blood cell (WBC) count is elevated at 14"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.  Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence of airway compresion on
   imaging or direct observation during ENT surgery. There was initially
   concern for bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted
   blood seen by IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to
   aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or GI source. Currently doing well
   on PS
   - Continue on PS vent setting, plan to extubated later this afternoon
   - wean down propofol and fentanyl
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 now, need to diurese her before attempting to
   extubate as pt is volume overloaded which makes extubation difficult in
   this chronic COPDer
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot in her gastric antrum with
   copious irrigation. No active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any,
   symptoms patient may have had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and
   outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID
   per family she has been taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put
   her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also
   being worked up for SCC malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach,
   however she could have esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD
   in esophagus). Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion.
   Per GI team, it does not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was
   from tonsilar or upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow HCT's [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - extubate today
   - can advance to clear liquids later today after extubation
   - Keep NG tube to low intermittent suction, per discussion with GI,
   mainly to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: Suspected to be SCC, unknown primary. Being
   followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8796**] in oncology.
   - Follow up final pathology reports
   - Further diagnosis and work-up per oncology and ENT teams
   - Continue antibiotics per ENT for now
   - Follow up with ENT re: removal of sutures,  check if sutures are
   absorbable/non-absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN, fentanyl on ventilator
   .
   #) HIV: Continue home medications, however there are no IV
   substitutes.. Last viral load was undetectable.
   - F/u with patient
s HIV physician if has to miss today
s dose after
   extubation
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications. Per outpatient notes, patient has been referred for lung
   transplant evaluation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after a biopsy of a right neck mass and tonsil. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and evaluation of bleeding etiology. She has a large right-sided neck mass but no evidence of airway compression on imaging or direct observation during ENT surgery. The initial concern for bleeding in the airway seems to be due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or a GI source. The patient is doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is planned to be extubated later in the afternoon. Propofol and fentanyl infusions are being weaned down.

The repeat EGD showed a clot in the cadia, which could not be dislodged despite copious irrigation. No active bleeding was noted. The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which increases the risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also being worked up for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) malignancy, although it is rare in the stomach. Other possibilities include arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or Dieulfoy's lesion. The GI team does not believe that the clot noted in her stomach was from a tonsilar or upper respiratory tract source.

Ms. [Known lastname] has a fever, which is concerning given the cessation of HIV medications. Antibiotics have been started and will continue until cultures return. She has a right-sided neck"

   Microbiology: Sputum-->25 PMN's, 2+ budding yeast
   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with hematemesis following biopsy of neck lesion with
   bronchoscopy and EGD performed to clear bleeding and clot.  At this
   time patient has likely ulcer identified in area of stomach as possible
   source in the stomach for bleeding.  She does have evolution of fever
   and concern for hospital acquired pneumonia is significant in that
   setting.  Overall, she tolerates minimal ventilatory support at this
   time.
   1)Hematemsis-H/O Ibuprofen use at relatively high dosing
   -HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   -Continue PPI IV
   -Diet can advance to clears
   2)Respiratory Failure-Initial intubation was for airway protection in
   the setting of significant bleeding.  She has had continued diuresis
   over past day.  She has had fever and with suggestion of persistence of
   left lower lobe infiltrate but realtively minimal sputum production.
   -Alb/Atrovent
   -Levoflox/Vanco
   -Will need to consider anesthesia presence at the time of extubation
   given failure in past.
   -At this time has reasonable optimization of volume status,  good cuff
   leak and good mental status which makes extubation reasonable to pursue
   with mental status assured
   3)Neck Mass-Biopsy results have returned with Squamous Cell
   -Will discuss with primary teams and consider timing and plan for
   informing patient and consideration of treatment options.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with hematemesis following a neck lesion biopsy. She has respiratory failure requiring intubation for airway protection and a neck mass with invasive squamous cell carcinoma confirmed by biopsy. The patient is currently sedated and unable to provide history. She has a fever, and there are concerns about hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient tolerates minimal ventilatory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Hematemesis: The patient's upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding may lead to further blood loss and potential anemia or hypotension.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could worsen, leading to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, potentially resulting in hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
3) Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia: The patient's fever and left lower lobe infiltrate suggest the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia. If not appropriately managed, this could progress to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
4) Extubation Failure: Given the patient's previous failure to wean off mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of extubation failure, which may necessitate re-intubation.
5) Neck Mass: The presence of invasive squamous cell carcinoma indicates a need for further evaluation and treatment planning, which could involve discussions with primary teams and consideration of treatment options.

Please note that this analysis is based on the provided progress note, and additional information or tests may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.  Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence of airway compresion on
   imaging or direct observation during ENT surgery. There was initially
   concern for bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted
   blood seen by IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to
   aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or GI source.
   - Currently doing well on PS, will plan to extubate later this
   afternoon.  Given history of prior difficult reintubation, will need to
   contact anesthesia to be present for extubation
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 now, need to diurese her before attempting to
   extubate as pt is volume overloaded which makes extubation difficult in
   this chronic COPDer
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot in her gastric antrum with
   copious irrigation. No active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any,
   symptoms patient may have had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and
   outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID
   per family she has been taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put
   her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and COPD who was admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management of hematemesis after a biopsy of the right neck mass and tonsil.
- The patient is intubated for airway protection and to evaluate the bleeding etiology. She is currently doing well on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and will be planned for extubation later in the afternoon.
- Lasix 20mg IV was given to diurese the patient before attempting extubation due to volume overload.
- The patient's repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a clot in the gastric antrum but no active bleeding.
- The patient has been taking ibuprofen, which puts her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is being worked up for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) malignancy, but further evaluation is needed.
- The patient has a fever, and her HIV medications have been temporarily stopped. Levoquin/vanc will be continued until cultures return.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.  Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #) Respiratory failure:  Intubated for both airway protection and for
   further evaluation of bleeding etiology. Although she does have large
   right-sided neck mass, there is no evidence of airway compresion on
   imaging or direct observation during ENT surgery. There was initially
   concern for bleeding in the airway, however it appears that clotted
   blood seen by IP team during bronchoscopy was more likely due to
   aspiration of bleeding from tonsils or GI source.
   - Currently doing well on PS, will plan to extubate later this
   afternoon.  Given history of prior difficult reintubation, will need to
   contact anesthesia to be present for extubation
   - Lasix 20mg IV x 1 now, need to diurese her before attempting to
   extubate as pt is volume overloaded which makes extubation difficult in
   this chronic COPDer
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot in her gastric antrum with
   copious irrigation. No active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any,
   symptoms patient may have had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and
   outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID
   per family she has been taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put
   her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also
   being worked up for SCC malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach,
   however she could have esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD
   in esophagus). Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion.
   Per GI team, it does not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was
   from tonsilar or upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow HCT's [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - can advance to clear liquids today
   - Keep NG tube to low intermittent suction, per discussion with GI,
   mainly to monitor for new or recurrent bleeding
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) fever: concern given cessation of HIV meds.  Will continue
   levoquin/vanc until cultures return.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: biopsy report showed SCC, unknown primary.
   Being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in oncology
   - F/u with oncology and ENT teams
   - Continue antibiotics per ENT for now
   - per ENT, sutures are absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN, fentanyl on ventilator
   .
   #) HIV: CD4 in [**12-14**] was 584.  In [**4-13**] was 543.  Continue home
   medications, however there are no IV substitutes.. Last viral load was
   undetectable.
   - per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], patient is ok to miss [**First Name (Titles) 8843**] [**Last Name (Titles) 8844**] until

   medications. Per outpatient notes, patient has been referred for lung
   transplant evaluation.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname] is a 55-year-old female with a medical history of HIV and COPD. She presented to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after a biopsy of her right neck mass and tonsil. She is hemodynamically stable but requires respiratory support due to respiratory failure. She also has a right-sided neck mass, which was biopsied and confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with an unknown primary source. Additionally, she experienced hematemesis, and further evaluation is needed to determine the bleeding etiology. Her fever is concerning, especially considering the cessation of HIV medications. She is currently on antibiotics per ENT recommendations, and her pain is being managed with dilaudid q3H PRN and fentanyl on the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for both airway protection and evaluation of the bleeding etiology. Since she has a history of difficult reintubation, close monitoring and coordination with the anesthesia team are essential during the extubation process.

2. Hematemesis: The patient experienced hematemesis, and a repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed a clot in the cadia, which could not be dislodged. There is no active bleeding noted at this time. The possible causes of hematemesis include peptic ulcer disease and gastritis due to the use of ibuprofen, SCC malignancy,"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.  Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #) Respiratory distress: Extubated now. Initially intubated for both
   airway protection and for further evaluation of bleeding etiology.
   Although she does have large right-sided neck mass, there is no
   evidence of airway compresion on imaging or direct observation during
   ENT surgery. There was initially concern for bleeding in the airway,
   however it appears that clotted blood seen by IP team during
   bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils
   or GI source. Patient has COPD and appears to be volume overloaded on
   exam.  For her COPD, per outpatient notes, patient has been referred
   for lung transplant evaluation.
   - goal I/O -1L today, lasix IV 20mg x 1 now. Pt is on lasix PO 40mg
   daily at home
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot in her gastric antrum with
   copious irrigation. No active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any,
   symptoms patient may have had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and
   outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID
   per family she has been taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put
   her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also
   being worked up for SCC malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach,
   however she could have esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD
   in esophagus). Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion.
   Per GI team, it does not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was
   from tonsilar or upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow HCT daily
   - per GI, will re-scope tomorrow
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - can advance to clear liquids today, if GI is agreeable
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) fever: concern given cessation of HIV meds.  Will continue
   levoquin/vanc until cultures return.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: biopsy report showed SCC, unknown primary.
   Awaiting tonsil biopsy result, will be back next week (one week after
   bx). Being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in oncology.  The sutures on right
   tonsil are absorbable per ENT.
   - F/u with oncology and ENT teams
   - f/u tonsil bx result
   - per ENT, sutures are absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN
   .
   #) HIV: CD4 in [**12-14**] was 584.  In [**4-13**] was 543.  Continue home
   medications, however there are no IV substitutes.. Last viral load was
   undetectable.
   - pt missed anti-HIV meds for 3 days as she was intubated. Will restart
   today
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications.

   -SCCA--will need to have staging, treatment planning all completed as
   patient stabilizes from respiratory status
   3)Hematemesis-
   -None further seen
   -Likely local insult at biopsy site
   -Will continue with normalization of coags
   -EGD tomorrow to clarify potential for primary source of malignancy as
   well as concern for possible source of recurrent bleeding
   -[**Hospital1 **] PPI and will be NPO after midnight

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of HIV and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure following a biopsy of her right neck mass. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation but has now been successfully extubated without any complications.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/53 to 153/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on aerosol-cool delivery device with a FiO2 of 40%. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 63 mmHg, PaO2 of 47 mmHg, and HCO3- of 34 mEq/L.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is overweight/obese, has symmetric chest expansion, dullness on percussion, and diminished breath sounds. There is also edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.3 g/dL, platelet count of 226 K/uL, creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, and sodium of 137 mEq/L.

Medical Complications:
1) Respiratory Failure: The patient is at risk for continued respiratory failure due to her underlying COPD and recent extubation. She will need close monitoring, incentive spirometry, and gradual weaning off supplemental oxygen.
2) Neck Mass: The patient has a suspected squamous cell carcinoma of the neck (SCCA). Further staging and treatment planning will be necessary once her respiratory status stabilizes.
3) Hematemesis: The patient experienced hematemesis following the biopsy procedure. It is likely due to local bleeding at the biopsy site. Coagulation normalization and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) tomorrow will help identify the primary source of malignancy and potential bleeding sites.
4) HIV: Anti-retroviral therapy will be continued after discussion with Dr. [Last Name (STitle)].

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
- Prolonged respiratory failure leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia.
- Development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and risk factors.
- Nosocomial infections due to invasive lines and procedures.
- Recurrent bleeding from the neck mass biopsy site or gastrointestinal tract.
- Worsening of HIV-related symptoms and opportun"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a 55 year old female with past medical history of HIV and
   COPD, who presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 4**] for further management of hematemesis
   after biopsy of right neck mass and tonsil.  Hemodynamically stable.
   .
   #) Respiratory distress: Extubated now. Initially intubated for both
   airway protection and for further evaluation of bleeding etiology.
   Although she does have large right-sided neck mass, there is no
   evidence of airway compresion on imaging or direct observation during
   ENT surgery. There was initially concern for bleeding in the airway,
   however it appears that clotted blood seen by IP team during
   bronchoscopy was more likely due to aspiration of bleeding from tonsils
   or GI source. Patient has COPD and appears to be volume overloaded on
   exam.  For her COPD, per outpatient notes, patient has been referred
   for lung transplant evaluation.
   - goal I/O -1L today, lasix IV 20mg x 1 now. Pt is on lasix PO 40mg
   daily at home
   - Continue home COPD medications, no evidence of exacerbation at
   present (Advair, Albuterol, Spiriva)
   .
   #) Hematemesis: Per GI, the repeat EGD again showed the clot in the
   cadia, still cannot dislodge the clot in her gastric antrum with
   copious irrigation. No active bleeding noted. Unclear what, if any,
   symptoms patient may have had prior to hematemesis. Per ENT team and
   outpatient pulmonary notes, she had been taking ibuprofen (800 mg TID
   per family she has been taking ibuprofen 800mg [**Hospital1 **]), so this would put
   her at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis. She is also
   being worked up for SCC malignancy, which would be rare in the stomach,
   however she could have esophageal SCC (though nothing reported on EGD
   in esophagus). Other possibilities include AVM or Dieulfoy's lesion.
   Per GI team, it does not appear that the clot noted in her stomach was
   from tonsilar or upper respiratory tract source.
   - Follow HCT daily
   - per GI, will re-scope tomorrow
   - continue [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI
   - can advance to clear liquids today, if GI is agreeable
   - Should patient demonstrate evidence of bleed, will call GI urgently,
   however would likely need IR embolization first
   - Patient currently with two 20 gage IV, one 18.
   .
   #) fever: concern given cessation of HIV meds.  Will continue
   levoquin/vanc until cultures return.
   .
   #) Right-sided neck mass: biopsy report showed SCC, unknown primary.
   Awaiting tonsil biopsy result, will be back next week (one week after
   bx). Being followed by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in oncology.  The sutures on right
   tonsil are absorbable per ENT.
   - F/u with oncology and ENT teams
   - f/u tonsil bx result
   - per ENT, sutures are absorbable
   - Pain control with diluadid q3H PRN
   .
   #) HIV: CD4 in [**12-14**] was 584.  In [**4-13**] was 543.  Continue home
   medications, however there are no IV substitutes.. Last viral load was
   undetectable.
   - pt missed anti-HIV meds for 3 days as she was intubated. Will restart
   today
   .
   #) COPD: As discussed above in respiratory failure, continuing home
   medications.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a past medical history of HIV and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after a biopsy of a right neck mass and tonsil. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable.

However, the patient has COPD and appears to be volume overloaded on examination.

2. Hematemesis: The patient experienced hematemesis, which was initially thought to be due to bleeding in the airway. However, it appears that the bleeding was more likely from the tonsils or gastrointestinal source. The repeat EGD showed a clot in the cadia, which could not be dislodged despite copious irrigation. No active bleeding was noted. The patient is at higher risk for peptic ulcer disease and gastritis due to ibuprofen use.

3. Fever: The patient has a concern for fever, especially given the cessation of HIV medications. Cultures are pending.

4. Right-sided neck mass: The patient has a biopsy-confirmed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of unknown primary. The tonsil biopsy result is still pending.

","Summary:
Ms. [Known lastname] is a 55-year-old female with a medical history of HIV and COPD. She presented to the ICU for further management of hematemesis after undergoing a biopsy of her right neck mass and tonsil. She is hemodynamically stable but has several ongoing medical issues that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient initially required intubation due to respiratory distress, but she has since been extubated. She has a history of COPD and appears to be volume overloaded. The goal is to maintain appropriate fluid balance and optimize her respiratory function.
2. Hematemesis: The patient experienced hematemesis, likely due to a peptic ulcer or gastritis caused by the use of ibuprofen. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact source of the bleeding. Currently, there is no active bleeding observed, but the patient has a clot in her gastric antrum.
3. Fever: The patient had a fever, which appears to be resolving. Cultures have been taken and show no signs of infection.
4. Right-sided Neck Mass: The biopsy of the right neck mass revealed squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but the primary source is unknown. The tonsil biopsy results are pending. The patient will be followed up by an oncologist, considering induction therapy for the SCC, taking into account her HIV-positive status.
5. HIV: The patient's CD4 count has been"

   Assessment and Plan
   55 yo female with concerning neck mass, now s/p biopsy with squamous
   cell CA seen on pathology.  Procedure was complicated by some
   significant bleeding with concern for GI as well as upper airway source
   and patient now has tolerated extubation without event and has not had
   recurrent evidence of bleeding.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient extubated has remained on reasonable
   continued wean of FIO2
   -OOB to chair
   -Will need to mobilize for improved recruitment of lung function
   -Albuterol nebs q 4 hours/Advair to continue
   -Ambulation is most important part of continued progress for her
   today
   2)Squamous Cell Carcinoma--primary not clear as neck mass did not
   appear to be associated with mucosal surface.
   -Sutures absorbable and to remain
   -Has tonsil that appears uninvolved but with significant neck lesion
   confirmed.
   3)Hematemsis/ANemia Secondary To Blood Loss-
   -GI to perform EGD in follow up to further define possibility of
   primary GI source for bleeding--would favor waiting for EGD with
   patient showing continued clinical improvement in respiratory status
   and with patient refusal
   -No further evidence of bleeding seen
   -INR has been normalized
   4)HIV-
   -Medications ordered but patient unable to take
   -Will work to control nausea
   Additional issues to be addressed as defined in the housestaff note of
   this date
 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
she is not able to identify
   source, describes overall ache in body, back, stomach and will use
   local Rx with Lidocaine to minimize impact upon respiratory drive and
   capacity to remain extubated.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 55-year-old female with a concerning neck mass that was found to have squamous cell carcinoma on biopsy. The procedure was complicated by significant bleeding, which could be from a gastrointestinal (GI) or upper airway source. The patient tolerated extubation without event and did not have recurrent evidence of bleeding.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was previously intubated but has now been extubated. She remains on reasonable continued wean of FIO2 and will need to be mobilized for improved recruitment of lung function. Albuterol nebs every 4 hours and Advair will continue.
2. Squamous Cell Carcinoma: The primary source of the carcinoma is unclear as the neck mass does not appear to be associated with a mucosal surface. Sutures are absorbable and will remain in place.
3. Hematemesis/Anemia Secondary to Blood Loss: The patient experienced significant bleeding during the procedure, which may have a primary GI source. Further investigation with an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is planned to define the possibility of a primary GI source for bleeding. However, with the patient showing continued clinical improvement in respiratory status and refusal of the procedure, it may be appropriate to wait for the EGD.
4. HIV: The patient is unable to take medications due to nausea. Pain control measures should be implemented,"
