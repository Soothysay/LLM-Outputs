   Patient's dyspnea is likely multifactorial with anemia, hypoxemia,
   acidemia, restrictive lung disease from pleural mets and probably
   lymphangitic tumor. Renal function is improving - renal failure likely
   due to intravascular volume depletion. Treating possible pneumonia with
   antibiotics. Patient to have LENI's to assess for DVT - possible PE.
   Patient being transfused for his anemia (likely due to chemo; possible
   contribution from low level GI bleed). Will begin opiates for dyspnea

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual who is experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by the need for oxygen supplementation and increased work of breathing. The patient's vital signs indicate hypotension and tachycardia, with a blood pressure reading of 109/53 mmHg and a heart rate of 103 bpm. The patient also has a history of hoarseness, for which an ENT consult has been deferred. The patient has been prescribed morphine for respiratory anxiety, restarted on Klonopin, and is currently receiving antibiotics (Vanc, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin). The patient's transthoracic echo revealed several cardiac abnormalities, including increased left ventricular filling pressure, moderate right ventricular dilatation, and moderate global hypokinesis. There is also mild mitral regurgitation and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a fluid balance with a net loss of 2,622 mL over the past 24 hours. The patient's recent lab results indicate acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, as well as elevated liver enzymes and abnormal platelet count. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating within the normal range. The patient's code status has been updated to DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's ongoing respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and oxygen"

   1. Hypoxia: Known metastatic lung cancer, but presents with change in
   sputum with occasional hypoxia. Given CXR and recent chemo, infection
   likely.  Thus have started on broad spectrum antibiotics and sputum
   cultures are sent.  Other potential infections include fungal and
   viral.  Non infectious etiologies include pulmonary embolism and
   progression of his cancer.   Given acute renal failure and abnormal
   chest x-ray, both CTA and V/Q scan are suboptimal choices.  Though
   getting a Q scan to assess solely perfusion could be considered.
   Having progression of his know metastatic disease especially in the
   form of lymphangitic spread could explain current hypoxia, though the
   progression may be somewhat acute.
   - Vanc, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Consider non-contrast CT versus perfusion scan
   - follow up viral and sputum cultures
   - urine legionella antigen
   2. Hypotension Acute Renal failure: Patient presents with acute renal
   failure in the setting of hypotension, NSAID use, and hypovolemia.
   Thus cause for renal failure is likely multifactorial.  Will evaluate
   with u/a, urine culture, will need to evaluate urine sediment. As well
   will give aggressive IVF.  Concern with AMS, hypotension, ARF and LFT
   abnormalities, that patient could have tamponade.  Pulsus 6 on initial
   eval but will recheck.
   - IVF
   - urine studies
   - renally dose meds
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, concerning for TTP, DIC or
   consumption in the setting of occult bleeding.  Will repeat diff in AM
   and hct.  If persistent low plt with schistocytes and no signs of DIC
   will contact heme for phasmaphoresis.
   - Tx plt if <20
   - [**Last Name (un) 4201**] hct/plt
   - consider heme c/s if still low and concern for TTP
   4. Acute hepatitis: Given hypotension, potentially ischemic secondary
   to poor perfusion.  Will also send off hepatitis serologies as could
   have reactivation of Hep B in the setting of chemotherapy.
   Additionally could be infection or metatastases.
   - hepatitis serologies
   - repeat LFTs

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with known metastatic lung cancer, presenting with acute renal failure, respiratory failure, hypotension, and thrombocytopenia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further management. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 109/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a non-rebreather mask. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a sinus tachycardia rhythm. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,228 mL and output of 3,850 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,622 mL. The patient is receiving morphine for respiratory anxiety and has been restarted on Klonopin. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, revealing increased left ventricular filling pressure, moderate global hypokinesis, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The patient's blood tests show elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and D-dimer. The patient's blood cultures and sputum cultures have been sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated due to suspected infection. The patient's"

 ANXIETY
   1. Hypoxia: Known metastatic lung cancer, but presents with change in
   sputum with occasional hypoxia. Given CXR and recent chemo, infection
   likely.  Thus have started on broad spectrum antibiotics and sputum
   cultures are sent.  Other potential infections include fungal and
   viral.  Non infectious etiologies include pulmonary embolism and
   progression of his cancer.   Given acute renal failure and abnormal
   chest x-ray, both CTA and V/Q scan are suboptimal choices.  Though
   getting a Q scan to assess solely perfusion could be considered.
   Having progression of his know metastatic disease especially in the
   form of lymphangitic spread could explain current hypoxia, though the
   progression may be somewhat acute.
   - Vanc, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin
   - Repeat CXR in AM
   - Consider non-contrast CT versus perfusion scan
   - follow up viral and sputum cultures
   - urine legionella antigen
   2. Hypotension Acute Renal failure: Patient presents with acute renal
   failure in the setting of hypotension, NSAID use, and hypovolemia.
   Thus cause for renal failure is likely multifactorial.  Will evaluate
   with u/a, urine culture, will need to evaluate urine sediment. As well
   will give aggressive IVF.  Concern with AMS, hypotension, ARF and LFT
   abnormalities, that patient could have tamponade.  Pulsus 6 on initial
   eval but will recheck.
   - IVF
   - urine studies
   - renally dose meds
   3. Thrombocytopenia: Unclear etiology, concerning for TTP, DIC or
   consumption in the setting of occult bleeding.  Will repeat diff in AM
   and hct.  If persistent low plt with schistocytes and no signs of DIC
   will contact heme for phasmaphoresis.
   - Tx plt if <20
   - [**Last Name (un) 4201**] hct/plt
   - consider heme c/s if still low and concern for TTP
   4. Acute hepatitis: Given hypotension, potentially ischemic secondary
   to poor perfusion.  Will also send off hepatitis serologies as could
   have reactivation of Hep B in the setting of chemotherapy.
   Additionally could be infection or metatastases.
   - hepatitis serologies
   - repeat LFTs
   - Likely do CT torso
   - echo

","The patient is a 71-year-old male with a history of metastatic lung cancer, presenting with acute hypoxia and respiratory failure. The patient also has acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and potential acute hepatitis. The patient's condition is complicated by the possibility of right ventricular pressure/volume overload, pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, mild mitral regurgitation, and moderate global left ventricular hypokinesis. The patient has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to suspected infection, and further investigations are planned to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. These may include repeat chest X-ray, consideration of a non-contrast CT or perfusion scan, follow-up viral and sputum cultures, urine Legionella antigen, aggressive IV fluid administration, renal dosing of medications, and reevaluation of the patient's condition."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and acute changes on chest X-ray concerning for infection. The patient required non-invasive respiratory support and was given morphine for anxiety and pain management due to inability to receive IV medication. The patient experienced a run of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but it self-limited. Vital signs remained mostly stable with heart rate around 110 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, and oxygen saturation ranging from 82-83%. The patient had an episode of urinary incontinence and received lasix previously. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the increased shortness of breath. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Malignancy: The patient's acute infectious process indicated by the changes on chest X-ray and increased work of breathing can lead to further respiratory failure and hypoxia.
2. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, AKI): The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 3,459 mL, indicating potential dehydration and possible renal dysfunction.
3. Respiratory Failure, Acute (not ARDS/[Doctor Last Name 11]): The patient's reliance on non-invasive respiratory support and low oxygen saturation suggests ongoing respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
4. Anxiety: The patient received SL morphine for anxiety, indicating ongoing anxiety symptoms that require management.

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) multiple times during the day due to respiratory distress. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were low, ranging from 74-83%. The patient also experienced an episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) but self-resolved. The patient received morphine for anxiety and was positioned to relieve breathing difficulties. The patient's vital signs remained relatively stable, with a heart rate of 110 bpm and blood pressure within normal limits. The patient is incontinent of urine and had a significant amount of lasix administered previously. The patient is expected to be discharged to home with hospice care today. The family is not emotionally prepared to take on hospice care on their own.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's repeated episodes of respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation levels indicate a potential respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying lung pathology or inadequate ventilation support.
2. Renal failure: The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. This could be secondary to hypotension, dehydration, or other factors.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which can contribute to poor organ perfusion and further complications.
4. Anxiety: The patient received morphine for anxiety, indicating that anxiety may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and shortness of breath. On the third day of his ICU stay, the patient's condition has worsened, with increased shortness of breath requiring non-invasive respiratory support. The patient also appears somnolent and minimally arousable. A chest X-ray showed significant changes concerning an acute infectious process. The patient made a do-not-resuscitate (CMO) decision last night, and plans are in motion for discharge to home with hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's increased work of breathing and dependence on non-invasive respiratory support indicate a potential respiratory failure. This could be due to the underlying lung cancer or an acute infectious process suggested by the chest X-ray changes.

2. Renal Failure: The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a significant negative balance, indicating a high output of fluids. This could be a sign of renal failure, as the kidneys may not be able to adequately remove waste products from the body.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings throughout the day show varying degrees of hypotension. It is essential to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure to ensure adequate organ perfusion.

4. Anxiety: The patient appears somnolent and minimally arousable, which may indicate anxiety or discomfort. Proper pain management and"

   Assessment and Plan
   ICU Care
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics, including levofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show a high heart rate (116 bpm) and low oxygen saturation (79%). The patient is receiving respiratory support through a non-rebreather mask and CPAP/PSV ventilator mode. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of -3,459 mL. There are no labs or radiology studies mentioned in the note.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoxemia: The low oxygen saturation level (79%) indicates hypoxemia, which may be due to respiratory distress or inadequate oxygen delivery.

2. Infection: The administration of multiple antibiotics suggests a possible infection. However, the specific type of infection is not mentioned in the progress note.

3. Fluid overload: Despite the negative fluid balance, the patient has received a significant amount of IV fluids (250 mL) and has had a total output of 3,790 mL. This could indicate ongoing fluid overload or inadequate urine output.

4. Respiratory failure: The use of CPAP/PSV mode and the need for high FiO2 suggest the possibility of respiratory failure. The patient's respiratory rate is also elevated.

5. Cardiac issues: The elevated heart rate (116"
