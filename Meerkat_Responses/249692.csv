   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo female with diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and has had hospital
   course complicated by paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Now she has
   evolved hypoxemia upon the medical floor and now complicated by
   tachycardia and possible evolution of atrial fibrillation.  Since
   arrival patient has had some improvement in oxygenation but tachycardia
   remains.
   1)Hypoxemia-
   -[**Month (only) 60**] be related to recurrent aspiration event as was acute onset.
   Primary insult with pulmonary edema is less likely as tachycardia was
   not initial presenting finding. PE has been evaluated with CT but does
   seem less likely, mucus plug, aspiration, further atelectasis are all
   certainly likley as primary drivers of recurrent hypoxemia.  Will-->
   -F/U final read of CTA
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -Repeat cultures as possible infectious trigger for acute changes
   -Continue with Caspo/Vanco/Cefepime/Flagyl/Vanco po
   -Monitor for worsening mental status and need for intubation
   -NPO for now
   -Unlikely CHF as primary driver here given exam and findings on imaging
   -No change in effusion and doubt contribution from this for hypoxemia
   but is not responding quickly could consider therapeutic tap of
   effusion with acceptable risk of re-accumulation.
   2)Tachycardia-Atrial Fibrillation
   -Diltiazem IV
   -Will need to Rx underlying pulmonary issue before expectation of
   improved heart rate will be seen
   -B-blocker to continue
   -Amiodarine to continue
   -Cardioversion to be considered if hemodynamic insult seen
   -Digoxin to consider start

   be in acute respiratory distress with sats 84-86% on 3L NC where has
   she has previously been 93% on 3L. She got lasix 20mg IV x 2.  Her
   heart rate was noted to be in the 80s at that time.  A CXR was
   performed and unchanged from prior study, therre was no note of
   pulmonary edema.  Pt was placed on a non-rebreather and her sats
   improved to 97%. In the interim, the patient's heart increased to the
   140s. The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further evaluation.
   .
   On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], the patient was afebrile, heart rate was 146,
   BP 106/81, RR 32 with a sat of 97% on 100% non-rebreather.  The patient
   was given 5mg IV metoprolol, and two dosed of 10mg IV diltiazem, and
   then was transitioned to an dilt drip.  The patient was titrated down
   to 60% face mask and was noted to be breathing comfortably.  Pt had not
   received her am amio, dilt or BBlocker, all were given as prescribed on

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation and recently diagnosed nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. She presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress, and her symptoms have been worsening. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to poor rate control rates in the 140s. The patient has a long history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She has been started on beta-blockers, diltiazem, and amiodarone. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing increased oxygen requirements and crackles on auscultation, indicating possible pulmonary edema or infection. A chest X-ray was performed but showed no significant findings. The patient has been given Lasix for concern of pulmonary edema. She also has a history of aspiration and mucus plugging.
2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Despite being on beta-blockers, diltiazem, and amiodarone, she has had multiple admissions to the ICU due to poor rate control rates in the 140s. It is uncertain whether the rhythm is sinus or fib, so adenosine will be given to assess the rhythm. Consideration will be given to digoxin if in fib and persistently tachycardic.

   59 y/o F with h/o mental retardation, recent dx of Nodular sclerosing
   Hodgkins Lymphoma s/p chemo on [**2144-10-9**] presented with tachycardia and
   respiratory distress.
   .
   Respiratory distress - Increased O2 requirement this am.  CXR
   unchanged.  ECHO borderline pulmonary hypertension. Patient has history
   of aspiration and mucus plugging.  Lasix given for concern of pulmonary
   edema.  Pt also restarted on soft diet after transfer from unit.  Has
   extensive history of aspiration.
   - PE CT chest - r/o PE
   - cont nebs
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - chest PT
   - thoracentesis tomorrow, will need platelets prior to procedure
   .
    # Paroxysmal A-fib: Multiple recent admissions to ICU due to poor rate
   control rates in 140s, otherwise hemodynamically stable.  Patient has
   long history of atrial fibrillation with RVR.  Typically not responsive
   to IV BBlocker.  Often spontaneously converts.  On BBlocker, Diltiazem
   and Amiodarone.  Had not received am meds.  AM meds given, plus
   additional IV BB and dilt before transitioning to Dilt drip.
   - on telemetry
   - repeat EKG
   - dilt gtt
   - continue BBlocker, titrate as blood pressure will tolerate
   - continue amiodarone at current dose
   - given, uncertaintly of sinus versus fib, will try dosing with
   adenosine to be assess rhythm
   - consider digoxin if in fib and persistently tachycardia
   .
   # Hodgkins Lymphoma: Pt is s/p EACoPP protocol on [**2144-7-21**] with
   cytoxan, doxorubacin on day 1 and etoposide on days [**2-13**]. Pt has also
   had pericardial tamponade s/p pericardiocentesis on [**2144-6-24**] and
   pericardial window on [**2143-7-25**]. Pt initiated ICE chemo reg on
   [**2144-10-9**].  WBC trending down after chemotherapy. Ideally should be
   transfused for hct>30 to maintain oxygenation.
   - continue Acyclovir & Bactrim ppx
   - crit today is 24.9, HCT goal 25, plt goal 20
   - patient is now neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary
   to chemo nadir, on filgrastrim
   - continue vanc, cefepime and caspo for empiric neutropenic coverage
   # H/o megacolon/Diarrhea: Pt is s/p volvulous & sigmoid resection with
   large dilated loops of colon visible on portable films.  She has
   required intermittent rectal tubes.  recent C. Diff toxin + [**2144-8-8**] &
   [**2144-9-1**].  C. diff [**10-19**] negative.
   - pt on definitive treatment for C. diff with IV flagyl and PO vanco
   - will continue for as long as patient on additional antibiotics
   .
   # F/E/N: Was transferred from unit on tube feeds and transitioned to
   soft regular diet and thin liquids following speech and swallow
   evaluation.  Patient has extensive history of aspiration.
   - NPO for now
   - restart tube feeds tomorrow if stable
   - replete lytes per onc sliding scales

","The patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB) and tachycardia. The 24-hour events indicate that the patient had a multi-lumen central venous catheter insertion and removal, as well as the placement of a peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line. The patient also received various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and heparin sodium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/71 to 119/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 85%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The fluid balance shows an intake of 1,332 mL and output of 4,300 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 2,968 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with high-flow nasal cannula and their ABG results indicate a pH of 7.45, PaCO2 of 42 mmHg, PaO2 of 468, and a FiO2 of 31%.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished but overweight/obese, with pale conjunctiva and poor dentition. The cardiovascular examination is normal, with symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and clear breath sounds. The abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress. The patient has undergone multiple medical interventions, including pericardiocentesis, pericardial window, sigmoid resection, and chemotherapy.

Current Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress has improved with diuresis, but there is a possibility of mucus plug or atelectases causing her symptoms. A therapeutic pleural effusion may be considered to expand the right lower lobe.

2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has episodes of atrial fibrillation/flutter, sometimes rate-controlled and sometimes with rapid ventricular response. She is currently on amiodarone, diltiazem, and metoprolol. If she has another episode, loading digoxin may be considered.

3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient has been treated with the EACoPP protocol including cytoxan, doxorubicin on day 1, and etoposide on days 2-13. She also had pericardial tamponade and pericardial window. Currently, she is undergoing ICE chemotherapy. Her white blood cell count is trending down after chemotherapy.

   Loculated left sided effusion with small volume of fluid
   Significant right sided effusion which has not changed in size from
   previous examination some months ago
   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo female with history of Hodgkin's Disease now admit to ICU with
   worsening respiratory distress.  This event was followed by significant
   tachycardia and likely evolution of atrial fibrillation as a secondary
   trigger.  Interestingly her pulmonary exam and pulmonary imaging does
   not reveal a significant new insult leaving recurrent aspiration,
   intermittent collapse, pulmonary edema or new pulmonary infection as
   most likely sources for the changes.  Of note patient overnight did
   have significant negative fluid balance with Lasix given.  There is an
   open question as to the relative contribution of the right sided
   effusion to the ongoing respiratory compromise.
   1)Respiratory Distress
based on response to diuresis certainly some
   component of volume overload may have been at play.  CTA shows no
   evidence of pulmonary emboli but was a limited study.   Her effusion
   really looks unchanged from previous.  This episode may have been a
   component of volume overload, small areas of mucus plugging and
   background compromise of respiratory status with chronic at this point
   effusions.
   -Continue with negative fluid balance
   -If effusion is tapped would have to consider continued drainage to
   allow time for re-expansion of lung which has been chronically
   collapsed and unlikely to re-expand quickly.
   -Wean O2 as possible to goal of NC support as was seen on the onc floor
   (3 lpm)
   -Have discussed with IP the possibility of drainage of the effusion and
   the risk of chest tube drainage would be substantial in neutorpenic
   state and we would favor a trial of thoracentesis to look for evidence
   of clinical response and consider chronic drainage only with clinical
   improvement seen and reaccumulation noted.
   2)Atrial Fibrillation
   -Continue with Amiodarone
   -Continue with beta blocker in place
   -Dilt gtt. Stopped
   -Given current sinus bradycardia would be cautious with further nodal
   blockade

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's Disease admitted to the ICU with worsening respiratory distress. The patient experienced significant tachycardia and likely evolved into atrial fibrillation. There are no new insults found in her pulmonary exam or imaging, leaving recurrent aspiration, intermittent collapse, pulmonary edema, or new pulmonary infection as potential sources for the changes. The patient had a negative fluid balance overnight and a CT scan showed loculated left-sided effusion with a small volume of fluid and a significant right-sided effusion that has not changed in size from previous examinations.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The respiratory distress may be due to a component of volume overload, small areas of mucus plugging, and background compromise of respiratory status with chronic effusions. Continuing with negative fluid balance, considering continued drainage of the effusion, weaning oxygen as possible, and discussing the possibility of drainage of the effusion are recommended.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: Continuing with amiodarone and beta-blocker is advised. Diltiazem should be stopped due to current sinus bradycardia, and caution should be exercised with further nodal blockade.
3. ID/Lymphoma: Prophylactic antibiotics (Bactrim/Acyclovir), treatment for Clostridium difficile (Flagyl/po Vanco), and management for febrile neutropenia (Vanco"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and has a pericardial effusion. She is currently on amiodarone, diltiazem, and metoprolol for rate control. The patient also has a history of pericardial tamponade, pericardial window, and sigmoid resection with volvulus. She is currently neutropenic with decreased platelets likely secondary to chemotherapy nadir. The patient's recent CT scan showed large pleural effusions on the right side with right lower lobe collapse, and loculated effusions on the left side, appearing unchanged from a previous scan. Thoracentesis was performed, with pre-transfusion of platelets and the fluid sent for culture. No pneumothorax was seen on chest X-ray. The patient has been on various antibiotics and antivirals for prophylaxis against infections. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 35.6°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's labs show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, an"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented to the ICU with shortness of breath and atrial fibrillation. A thoracentesis was performed, with pre-transfusion of platelets and fluid sent for culture. The patient has large pleural effusions on the right side, along with right lower lobe collapse, and loculated effusions on the left side, appearing unchanged from the previous CT scan. The patient's diet was changed to soft solids and thin liquids due to speech and swallowing difficulties. There was an episode of desaturation to 85% at 8 pm, which improved after administration of Lasix and nebulizer treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 106/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 178. The physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished but overweight/obese, with pale conjunctiva and poor dentition. The cardiovascular examination is normal, with no jugular venous distention seen. The respiratory examination shows symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, and clear breath sounds. The abdominal examination reveals a soft, non-tender abdomen with bowel sounds present, but the patient is described as distended and obese"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old individual with mental retardation and a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma. They were admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure, which was initially managed with intubation. The patient improved and was transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU yesterday with respiratory distress. A CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed, ruling out pulmonary embolism. Thoracentesis was also performed. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, diuretics, and other ICU medications. The patient's vital signs indicate a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure of 111/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on high-flow oxygen therapy and their ABG results show a pH of 7.36, PaCO2 of 59 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 99. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bibasilar region of the lungs and the patient is considered critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to pulmonary edema, which may be caused by fluid overload or heart failure.
2. Recurrent Aspiration: The patient's mental retardation and large bilateral effusions increase the risk of recurrent aspiration, leading to respiratory failure.
3. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a possibility of infection,"

The patient is a 69-year-old individual with mental retardation, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and a history of recurrent respiratory failure. They were originally admitted for respiratory failure and required intubation in the MICU. After improvement, the patient was transferred to the floor but returned to the MICU yesterday due to respiratory distress. A computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) was performed, which was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient received diuretics and showed some improvement but continues to periodically desaturate.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's respiratory distress may be caused by pulmonary edema, which is likely multifactorial due to transudative effusions and recurrent aspiration. The patient's low blood pressure and fluid balance indicate a possible overload of fluids in the lungs.
2. Recurrent Aspiration: The patient's history of mental retardation and recurrent aspiration events suggests an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma: The patient's underlying Hodgkin's lymphoma may contribute to their overall critical condition. The disease itself can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of infections.
4. Neutropenia: The patient was previously neutropenic, indicating a compromised immune system. This puts them at a higher risk for infections and complications.
5. Code Status: The patient has a do not resuscitate (D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy on 10/9/2144. She presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress. The patient is currently on non-invasive ventilation and has been improving with BIPAP. She has a transudate pleural effusion that reaccumulated after tapping, but no signs of congestive heart failure on echocardiogram. She is at high risk of aspiration with multiple witnessed episodes.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress and required non-invasive ventilation. She responded to diuretics and is improving.
2. Hypercarbic distress: The patient had an episode of hypercarbic respiratory distress, which improved with BIPAP.
3. Transudate pleural effusion: The patient has a transudate pleural effusion that reaccumulated after tapping. There are no signs of congestive heart failure on echocardiogram.
4. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has had episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter. She is currently on amiodarone, diltiazem, and metoprolol. If she has another episode, digoxin loading may be considered.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB). She was placed on non-invasive ventilation due to progressive hypercarbic respiratory distress and improved with BIPAP. Her hemodynamics are stable, and both urine and sputum cultures are positive for yeast. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and sedatives.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on non-invasive ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary to prevent and manage this complication.

2. Nosocomial infections: The presence of yeast in both urine and sputum cultures suggests a possible nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infection. It is crucial to identify the specific fungal organism causing the infection and initiate appropriate antifungal treatment promptly.

3. Fluid overload: The patient has received a significant amount of fluid over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative fluid balance. Close monitoring of fluid intake and output is essential to prevent fluid overload and associated complications such as pulmonary edema.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities, which increases the risk of developing DVT. Regular assessment of peripheral pulses"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of mental retardation, recent diagnosis of Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's Lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy. She presented with tachycardia and respiratory distress. The patient has been experiencing episodes of hypercarbic respiratory distress, but responded to non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and is now on bipap. She has a history of mental retardation, mental status changes, and recent episodes of agitation. The patient has a positive yeast culture in both urine and sputum, indicating a possible fungal infection. She is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungal medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may worsen, leading to the need for endotracheal intubation.
2. Fungal Infection: The positive yeast cultures in urine and sputum suggest a potential fungal infection. If left untreated, this can lead to further complications such as pneumonia or disseminated infection.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low (95/55 mmHg), indicating potential hypotension. If not adequately managed, this could lead to organ hypoperfusion and dysfunction.
4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's laboratory results show abnormalities in potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), magnesium (Mg++), and calcium (Ca++) levels. These im"

   Imaging: CXR--Improved aeration of lungs bilaterally.
   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo female with history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma and admission with
   respiratory compromise and tachycardia who is now s/p tap of
   signfiicant effusion with a trend to improved CXR findings but
   persistent O2 requirement and tachycardia.  She has had excellent
   response to diuresis and positive airway pressure in regards to lung
   expansion.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Intermittent BIPAP at night may provide some additional support and
   maintain lung recruitment in the setting of bed-ridden status and
   inability to comply with incentive spirometry
   -Continue with negative fluid balance today

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of Hodgkin's Lymphoma admitted to the ICU for respiratory compromise and tachycardia. She underwent a thoracentesis of a significant effusion and showed improvement in chest X-ray findings, but still requires supplemental oxygen and has persistent tachycardia. The patient has responded well to diuretics and positive airway pressure for lung expansion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure:
- Intermittent BIPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) at night may provide additional support and maintain lung recruitment due to the bedridden status and inability to comply with incentive spirometry.
- Continue with negative fluid balance today.
- Wean O2 as tolerated.
- Encouraging trend seen.

2. Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia:
- Control heart rate with Diltiazem (Dilt gtt).
- Continue telemetry monitoring.
- Trial of Amiodarone and Beta Blocker for recurrent issues.
- Consider Digoxin load to maintain stabilization of heart rate.

3. Hodgkin's Lymphoma:
- ANC (Absolute Neutrophil Count) has improved.
- Discuss discontinuation of prophylaxis after discussion with oncology team.

ICU Care:
- Continue with PO intake supervised.
- Maintain glycemic control.
- PICC Line in place.
- Prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP ("

   requested cardiology consult yesterday, cards said no to digoxin for
   atrial fibrillation better to maximize diltiazem. diltiazem was changed
   from 30 to 60 QID yesterday. Oncology said that if ANC was > 1000 then
   could d/c antibiotics, so d/c all antibiotics except for c. diff

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation, recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma, and previous chemotherapy treatment. She presented with acute respiratory distress, likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient required non-invasive ventilation but was later intubated.

The patient's 24-hour events include netting out 500 cc, pulling the PICC line, and requesting a cardiology consult for atrial fibrillation. The consult recommended against using digoxin and instead increased the dose of diltiazem. Antibiotics were discontinued except for C. diff treatment. The patient received an extra dose of Neupogen and underwent aggressive chest physiotherapy with fentanyl for pain management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with mental retardation and a recent diagnosis of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma. She underwent chemotherapy on October 29th and presented with acute respiratory distress, likely due to aspiration and mucus plugging. The patient was placed on non-invasive ventilation from 05:30 PM to 06:00 PM on October 30th.

Over the past day, the patient had a net output of -500 cc, and more lasix was prescribed. The patient pulled out her PICC line, and a new IV was placed. A cardiology consult was requested yesterday, and it was decided not to use digoxin for atrial fibrillation, instead opting for maximizing diltiazem. Diltiazem was increased from 30 to 60 QID yesterday. Oncology advised discontinuing antibiotics, except for C. diff treatment, which will be completed. The patient received an extra dose of Neupogen. The patient moved her bowels on her own yesterday and received aggressive chest physical therapy for pain. Pleural fluid gram stain showed no polys, no microrganisms, and no growth. Urine culture grew yeast > 100,000.

The patient's allergies include no known drug allergies. The last doses of antibiotics were administered on October 29th.
