 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism.
   Presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. Recently returned
   from [**Country 3310**].
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy:
   Concerning that patient has diagnosis of HIV (though CD4 was 288 on
   [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable) and additionally has
   immunosuppression related to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and
   Remicade. UA was slightly positive in the ED and may contribute to
   fevers, though an underwhelming explanation of fevers up to 103 and
   facial lymphadenopathy. Patient reported to have dental infections in
   the past; however, no current evidence to suggest a dental etiology.
   Patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has
   experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked
   by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Patient was in
   [**Country 3310**] without malarial prophylaxis, so will need to rule-out malaria.
   Meningitis seems unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy;
   further, patient's loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam
   limited by pain from lymphadenopathy. Distant possibility is
   hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, which would be hard to distinguish
   clinically from adult Still's disease flare given that both can present
   with fever, lymphadenopathy, increased ferritin level. Going against
   HLH is the patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's along with
   abscence of two-line cytopenia associated with HLH.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, at increased dosing for meningitis pending final CSF
   results
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal
   serologies, HBV viral load
   - Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending
   that result
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's
   flare
   - Trend ferritin
   - Trend CBC and check triglycerides and fibrinogen level for HLH
   #. Hypotension:
   Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia and
   distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital in
   past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on broad
   spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that time.
   - Fluid boluses with goal of decreased pressor requirement and
   increased UOP
   - Support blood pressure with vasoactive agents
   - Patient being broadly treated with Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin at
   this time
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6H for stress dose steroids in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. HIV:
   Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and undetectable
   VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease:
   Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain after returning from a trip to [Country 3310]. The patient has been diagnosed with bacterial meningitis and is experiencing hypotension. She has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has experienced flares in the past. Other conditions that need to be ruled out include malaria, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and dental infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient is already being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting final CSF results.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial, including hypovolemia and septic physiology. She is being treated with fluid boluses, vasoactive agents, and stress dose steroids.
3. HIV: The patient's HIV control is good, with a recent CD4 count of 288 and undetectable viral load. She will continue her current antiretroviral therapy and prophylaxis with Bactrim SS.
4. Adult Still's Disease: This flare could be a presentation of adult Still's disease. Rheumatology input is appreciated, and the patient's treatment with Remicade and methotrexate should be held temporarily.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 MENINGITIS, BACTERIAL
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism.
   Presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. Recently returned
   from [**Country 3310**].
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy:
   Concerning that patient has diagnosis of HIV (though CD4 was 288 on
   [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable) and additionally has
   immunosuppression related to chronic prednisone, methotrexate, and
   Remicade. UA was slightly positive in the ED and may contribute to
   fevers, though an underwhelming explanation of fevers up to 103 and
   facial lymphadenopathy. Patient reported to have dental infections in
   the past; however, no current evidence to suggest a dental etiology.
   Patient has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has
   experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked
   by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Meningitis seems
   unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy; further, patient's
   loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam limited by pain
   from lymphadenopathy. Distant possibility is hemophagocytic
   lymphohistiocytosis, which would be hard to distinguish clinically from
   adult Still's disease flare given that both can present with fever,
   lymphadenopathy, increased ferritin level. Going against HLH is the
   patient's prior diagnosis of adult Still's along with abscence of
   two-line cytopenia associated with HLH.  Cryptococcal and malaria
   negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, at increased dosing for meningitis pending final CSF
   results.  Also add Flagyll today for anaerobic coverage.
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, urine culture, cryptococcal
   serologies, HBV viral load
   - Send influenza DFA and treat empirically with oseltamivir pending
   that result
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Consult rheumatology for assistance in management of adult Still's
   flare
   -check EBV, CMV PCR
   -confirm with radiology that could view teeth or ask if they want
   panorex.
   - Trend ferritin
   #. Hypotension:
   Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia and
   distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital in
   past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on broad
   spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that time.
   - Has had good UOP, and now off pressors.  Bolus IVF to keep off if
   possible.
   - Patient being broadly treated with Vanc, ceftriaxone, ampicillin at
   this time, adding flagyll
   - Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6H for stress dose steroids in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time.

","The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism. She presents with fevers, neck pain, and facial pain. The patient recently returned from [Country 3310]. She has a known diagnosis of adult Still's disease and has experienced flares in the past during which her course has been marked by submental lymphadenopathy, fever, and hypotension. Meningitis seems unlikely to cause this degree of lymphadenopathy; further, the patient's loss of supple neck is easily confused with an exam limited by pain from lymphadenopathy. 

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.8 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels at 81, and an increased lactate dehydrogenase level of 293 IU/L. The patient's potassium level is low at 2.9 mEq/L, and her magnesium level is also low at 0.8 mg/dL. 

The patient has multiple medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin), antivirals (Efavirenz, Emtricitabine-Tenofovir), and steroids (Hydrocortisone). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include bacterial meningitis, septic shock, and adult Still's disease flare.

   Chief Complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.  Consider TTE in am for
   ?pericarditis/effusion.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV  (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Feel that this is most
   consistent with Still
s flare given past presentations, but must rule
   out infection first.  Also now with positive blood cultures that worsen
   worry for infection.
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]. The patient's condition is summarized as follows:

1. Fever and lymphadenopathy: The patient has a broad differential diagnosis of infectious versus rheumatologic causes. There is concern for infection due to chronic immunosuppression from treatment for Still's disease and HIV. However, given the patient's past presentations, it is more consistent with a Still's flare. Infection must be ruled out first. Cryptococcal and malaria tests were negative. Empiric antibiotic coverage should be continued with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Follow-up blood and urine cultures should be done, and pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load should be followed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial, including hypovolemia and distributive/septic physiology. Fluid boluses should be given to maintain adequate blood pressure, and broad-spectrum antibiotics should be continued. The possibility of pericardial effusion from pericarditis related to a Still's flare should be considered, and a TTE should be performed today to assess for vegetations due to bacter"

   Chief Complaint: Fever, lymphadenopathy
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV
   20mg TID.  Page [**Hospital1 609**] pager [**Numeric Identifier 12269**] with questions ([**Doctor Last Name 3314**])
   - Gave hydroxyzine for itching
   - Wasn't eating very much and slightly tachycardic with BPs 90's/40's
   so gave 1L NS bolus.  Then got tachycardic to the 110's and complaining
   of thirst with fever of 100.7, blood cultures sent and given another
   liter of NS, then a liter of LR.

   Assessment and Plan
   49 yo female with HIV, adult onset Still
s disease, and hypothyroidism
   who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain and hypotension after
   a recent trip to [**Country 3310**]
   #. Fever / lymphadenopathy: Broad differential is infectious vs
   rheumatologic.  Concern for infection given chronic immunosuppression
   due to treatment for Still
s disease and diagnosis of HIV (though CD4
   was 288 on [**2193-10-14**] and VL was undetectable).  Also now with positive
   blood cultures that worsen worry for infection.  Feel that she also
   likely has Still
s flare on top of an infection given past
   presentations..
   - Cryptococcal and malaria negative.
   - Continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone,
   Ampicillin, and Flagyl (for anaerobic coverage)
 can likely stop
   ampicillin if CSF cultures negative x 48 hours as less likely
   meningitis
   - FU blood and urine cultures
   - Follow-up pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load
   - Negative for flu
   - Appreciate ID recs
   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   - Consider TTE to look for endocarditis if Staph in cultures
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibiotics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm vs tomorrow morning to assess for
   progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. The patient has been diagnosed with cellulitis with possible Ludwig's angina, swelling of the hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient's blood cultures grew Gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a bacterial infection. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. Other pending tests include CMV and EBV viral load, stool culture, and urine culture. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/54 mmHg to 65/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, normal hemoglobin, and elevated C-reactive protein level. Urinalysis reveals a few leukocytes, 3 white blood cells per high power field, and 30 mg/dL protein. The patient is currently receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, and stress dose steroids. The patient's condition requires close monitoring in the ICU for any potential complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Given the patient's immunosuppressed state due to HIV treatment and adult-onset Still's disease, the risk of infection is high. The positive blood cultures indicate a bacterial infection, and further testing is needed to identify the causative organism.
2. Abscess formation: The swelling of the hypopharynx and possible evolving abscess suggest the possibility of an abscess formation. Close monitoring and repeat imaging are necessary to assess for any progression or resolution.
3. Septic shock: The patient's hypotension and tachycardia may indicate septic shock. Close monitoring of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial. Prompt administration of antibiotics and IV fluids is essential.
4. Throat edema: The significant swelling of the throat may compromise the patient's airway. ENT follow-up and repeated CT scans are necessary to assess for any changes or worsening of the edema.
5. Endocarditis: The presence of Gram-positive cocci in clusters in the blood cultures raises concern for endocarditis. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) should be considered if Staphylococcus species are identified in the cultures.
6. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient's chronic use of steroids for Still's disease and stress dose steroids may have caused iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression. Monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency, such as hypotension and hyperpigmentation, is important.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - Final CT Head/Neck showed significant swelling of SQ fat of face, and
   sublingual space representing cellulitis with possible Ludwig's,
   swelling of hypopharynx, possible evolving abscess, and cervical LAD
   increased from [**2192-11-10**].
   - Grew GPC in clusters in blood from ED (1/4 bottles)
   - Flu swab negative, precautions dc'ed
   - ID recs: Continue Abx, when CSF negative, can cut back to
   ceftriaxone, add Flagyl (which we had already done), check CMV and EBV
   viral load, can dc flu precautions
   - ENT recs: Definite laryngeal edema but no active airway compromise,
   will rescope tomorrow, rescan [**2193-12-30**] for evolution of abscess (48
   hours after last one) - CT with contrast.  Full note in OMR
   - Radiology thought CT neck better than dental films to look for tooth
   abscess
   - Rheum recs: Likely is Still's flare but can't rule it out, consider
   echo because of GPC in clusters, consider lupus-like picture, [**Doctor First Name **],
   dsDNA, consider LN biopsy if doesn't improve, would start solumedrol IV

   - Appreciate rheum recs
   - FU EBV, CMV PCR
   - Trend ferritin, now increasing
   - Consider lymph node biopsy if doesn
t improve
   #. Hypotension: Possible that this is multifactorial from hypovolemia
   and distributive/septic physiology. Patient has presented to hospital
   in past with hypotension without definitive cause. She improved on
   broad spectrum antibiotics as well as stress dose steroids at that
   time.  Requiring fluid boluses both for tachycardia and low urine
   output, although feel that the tachycardia may have been related to
   fevers.
   - Monitor UOP.  Bolus IVF to keep off pressors if possible.
   - Continue antibioitics as above
   - Have switched to solumedrol 20mg IV TID per rheum recs in setting of
   chronic iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression
   - Could possibly have a pericardial effusion from pericarditis from
   Still
s flare contributing to tachycardia and hypotension, will get TTE
   today which can also look for vegetations due to bacteremia
   #. Throat edema/lymphadenopahty: ENT following who said she has
   significant swelling but no difficulty breathing or maintaining O2
   sats.
   - Appreciate ENT recs
   - Will repeat CT scan today at 6pm to assess for progression/resolution
   - ENT will rescope her today to assess for interval change
   #. HIV: Good outpatient control with most recent CD4 of 288 and
   undetectable VL.
   - Continue Efavirenz-Emtricitabin-Tenofov [ATRIPLA] 600 mg-200 mg-300
   mg DAILY
   - Continue prophylaxis with Bactrim SS daily
   #. Still's disease: Possible this presentation is a flare as above.
   CRP markedly elevated
   - Appreciate Rheumatology input
   - Hold on Remicade, methotrexate at this time
   - FU [**Doctor First Name **], dsDNA
   - Continue solumedrol

   Disposition: ICU for now given throat edema
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism who presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. 

The patient's current condition includes fever, lymphadenopathy, hypotension, throat edema, and possible evolving abscess in the hypopharynx. The patient has positive blood cultures showing growth of Gram-positive cocci in clusters, indicating a possible bacterial infection. 

The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics including Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, Ampicillin, and Flagyl for anaerobic coverage. The cultures are pending, and the patient's blood and urine cultures have been sent for further testing.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, low blood pressure, and a slightly elevated respiratory rate. The patient has received fluid boluses due to tachycardia and low urine output.

The assessment and plan include ruling out infection and considering the possibility of a Still's flare given the patient's past presentations. The patient's HIV status is well-controlled with a recent CD4 count of 288 and undetectable viral load. 

The patient is currently receiving solumedrol IV due to possible iatrogenic adrenal axis suppression from chronic treatment for Still's disease. The patient will undergo a repeat CT scan and ENT rescope to assess"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently critically ill and presenting with sepsis and hypotension. The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluids. There are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to immunosuppression from rheumatologic disease and ongoing antibiotic treatment. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results, especially white blood cell count, is necessary.

2. Organ dysfunction: The patient's kidneys are at risk due to hypotension and potential septic shock. Monitoring urine output and serum creatinine levels is important to assess kidney function.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is slightly low (190 K/uL), which can increase the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters and consideration for platelet transfusion if significant bleeding occurs.

4. Hypoglycemia: The patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to avoid hypoglycemia.

5. Diarrhea: The patient is experiencing diarrhea, which could be due to antibiotics or an underlying infection. Stool cultures and further evaluation may be needed to identify the cause and manage it appropriately.

6. Respiratory complications: The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula. Monitoring oxygen saturation levels and respiratory status is important to detect any worsening respiratory distress or infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old female with HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/52 mmHg to 140/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals edematous face, particularly eyelids, bulky submandibular and cervical lymphadenopathy, crackles at both lung bases, and edematous hands/arms.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, normal creatinine levels, mildly elevated troponin T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient also has positive blood cultures for coagulase-negative staphylococcus.

The patient is currently on multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and metronidazole, as per ID recommendations. The plan includes following up on blood and urine cultures, awaiting pending CSF, blood cultures, HBV viral load, and considering a lymph node biopsy if there is no improvement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 49-year-old female with a history of HIV, adult-onset Still's disease, and hypothyroidism. She presented with fevers, neck pain, facial pain, and hypotension after a recent trip to [Country 3310]. The patient's condition is complicated by chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and HIV.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has positive blood cultures that worsen the worry for infection. There is a concern for infection given her chronic immunosuppression due to treatment for Still's disease and diagnosis of HIV. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been continued with Vancomycin, Ceftriaxone, and Flagyl.
2. Still's disease flare: The patient may have a Still's disease flare presenting with symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy. Rheumatology input is appreciated, and solumedrol has been continued.
3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be multifactorial from hypovolemia and distributive/septic physiology. Fluid boluses are being given as needed, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued.
4. Throat edema/lymphadenopathy: The patient has significant swelling of the throat and lymphadenopathy. ENT follow-up is appreciated, and a repeat CT scan is planned today to assess for progression/resolution.
5. HIV management: The patient's HIV"
