   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   .
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diuresis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - continue phenylephrine drip as needed
   - Continue midodrine
   - Consider CRRT again if pt does not put out adequate urine, however
   patient responded to IV lasix yesterday.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Consider restarting CRRT
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on

   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi

   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed

   Got blood and crystalloid; now on low dose phenylephrine
   Bps now in ok range; urine output has picked up considerably (and
   predictably, with volume resuscitation)
   I remain cautiously optimistic about possibility of TV repair to
   improve her overall cardiac function.  She has a normal pulmonary
   vascular resistance and has major left ventricular preload dependence
   issue.  A failing right ventricle with 3+ tricuspid regurgitation
   cannot provide adequate left heart venous return.  Possibility of
   worsening right heart failure after elimination of tricuspid
   regurgitation can probably be minimized through judicious volume
   management postoperatively.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, and has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal function, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient underwent percutaneous closure of a patent foramen ovale without complication, but has a mild residual shunt on echo. She is also diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, possible sepsis, hyponatremia, and diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is resistant to diuresis due to poor forward flow from right heart failure. The main concern is gross fluid overload, which can lead to worsening diastolic dysfunction and potentially pulmonary edema.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure): The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, suggesting worsening renal function. This could be secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure or other factors. If not managed properly, it may progress to chronic renal failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient has grown Serratia from urine and CoNS from blood culture and catheter tip culture. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, but there is a consideration to broaden gram-negative coverage with aztreonam if the patient decompensates.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (SHF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and percutaneous pulmonary artery occluder (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) due to failure to increase urine output (UOP) on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is resistant to diuresis, suggesting that she may not be responding to the diuretic treatment. This could be due to poor forward flow from right heart failure, leading to worsening diastolic dysfunction. Removing the excess fluid is crucial for her improvement.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels continued to trend up, indicating worsening renal function. This is likely secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure, and urine microscopy does not suggest acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The patient has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   .
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diureisis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - Will start pt on phenylephrine drip
   - Continue midodrine
   - Consider CRRT again if pt does not put out urine.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Consider restarting CRRT
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on
   vanc and cipro
   -consider broadening gram neg coverage to aztreonam
   -consider starting flagyl for suspected c diff
   -renally dose vanc
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi
   - PIV x2
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   .
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely from volume overload due to heart failure.
   - Trend lytes
   - 1000ml fluid restriction
   .
   # Diarrhea: [**Month (only) 60**] be from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, perforated patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with endovascular device, and transfer from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU).

The patient is currently experiencing several medical complications:

1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is resistant to diuretics, suggesting that she may have poor forward flow from right heart failure, leading to low filling volumes for the left heart. This condition is causing gross fluid overload and a dilated right ventricle, which is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction. The only way for the patient to improve clinically is by removing excess fluid. The plan is to start the patient on a phenylephrine drip, continue midodrine, and consider continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) if the patient does not produce urine.

2. Acute renal failure (ARF), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have continued to trend upward over the course of yesterday, suggesting worsening renal function. This is likely secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure, and urine microscopy does not suggest acute tubular necrosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and percutaneous patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair. She has been resistant to diuresis despite an aggressive diuretic regimen and is now in the cardiac critical care unit (CCU).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is showing signs of volume overload and poor forward flow due to right heart failure, which can worsen diastolic dysfunction. Removing excess fluid is crucial for her improvement.
2. ARF (acute renal failure), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are trending upwards, indicating worsening renal function. This could be secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure. CRRT (continuous renal replacement therapy) may be necessary if the patient does not produce urine.
3. Sepsis: The patient has grown serratia from urine and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from blood culture and catheter tip culture. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, but gram-negative coverage may need to be broadened, and flagyl may be considered for suspected Clostridium difficile infection"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 50-year-old male admitted to the ICU for management of acute renal failure, heart failure (CHF), impaired skin integrity, anemia secondary to blood loss, and gastrointestinal bleed. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/38 to 116/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on room air. The patient is off pressors and has been maintaining stable blood pressures.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's hemoglobin (Hct) level has remained stable at 33%, without the need for transfusions. Fluid balance has been maintained with a total input of 1,354 mL and output of 1,215 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 139 mL. The patient has received pantoprazole and heparin sodium as part of their ICU medications. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was ciprofloxacin at 10:00 PM on 04/08/2108.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for occasional hives. The patient's WBC count has decreased from 7.7 to 6.0, while the platelet count has increased from 96,000 to 321,000. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels have risen from 21 mg/d"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   .
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diuresis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - continue phenylephrine drip as needed
   - Continue midodrine
   - Consider CRRT again if pt does not put out adequate urine, however
   patient responded to IV lasix yesterday.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Appreciate renal recs
   - Consider restarting CRRT
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on
   vanc and cipro
   -consider broadening gram neg coverage to aztreonam if pt decompensates
   -renally dose vanc
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi
   - PIV x2
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   .
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely from volume overload due to heart failure.
   - Trend lytes
   - 1000ml fluid restriction
   .
   # Diarrhea: [**Month (only) 60**] be from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.
   - C Diff neg on [**3-22**]. will resend given new episode of diarrhea.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   .
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diuresis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - Continue midodrine
   - UOP on her own kept her at even balance over the day and night
   yesterday.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Getting better
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on
   vanc and cipro
   -consider broadening gram neg coverage to aztreonam if pt decompensates
   -renally dose vanc
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed

   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi

   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   .
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks

   Her bp remains tenuous and she should remain in ccu.  I am waiting for
   [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name 5649**] to weigh in on the matter of the tricuspid valve repair.
   It should be noted that her mean right atrial pressure at cath has
   consistently been equal to her mean pulmonary artery pressure.  What
   does that mean?  It means that eliminating the tricuspid regurgitation
   by repairing or replacing the tricuspid valve should not result in any
   more demand for stroke work out of the right ventricle compared to the
   current status.  Would continue midodrine and ccu observation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, with a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and repair of patent foramen ovale (PFO) with an endovascular device. The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) and has been resistant to diuresis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's diastolic dysfunction is worsening due to fluid overload, leading to poor forward flow. This can result in further deterioration of heart function and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. ARF (Acute Renal Failure), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by the rising creatinine levels. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and the need for renal replacement therapy.
3. Sepsis: The patient has grown Serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cultures, indicating a possible infection. If not appropriately managed, this could lead to sepsis and septic shock.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic persistent atrial fibrillation, which can lead to an increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular complications if not properly controlled.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PFO) repair.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient is resistant to diuretics, suggesting poor forward flow due to right heart failure. This may worsen diastolic dysfunction and fluid overload.
2. ARF (acute renal failure), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been trending up, suggesting pre-renal azotemia. This may be secondary to poor forward flow from heart failure. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure and has been on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) before.
3. Sepsis: The patient has grown serratia from urine and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from blood cultures and catheter tip cultures. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, but there is a consideration for broadening gram-negative coverage to aztreonam if the patient decompensates.

   I will discuss TV repair with patient and Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) 5649**] this
   afternoon.  As I have indicated, it is my belief that correction of the
   TR offers the only hope of a durable (relatively speaking)
solution
   to her predicament which consists of volume overload vs systemic
   hypotension and azotemia.  I have also emphasized repeatedly both to
   the patient and her entire family that TV repair ([**Last Name (un) 8769**] [**Doctor Last Name 6610**]
   semirigid annuloplasty ring implantation) carries with it considerable
   operative mortality risk (5-10%) and is not guaranteed to improve her
   condition at all.  However, given her normal PVR, healthy lungs,
   relatively healthy kidneys, and the ability of her RV to generate high
   MAP (which means that it has significant contractile reserve, or in
   other words, a fairly well-preserved capacity to generate stroke-work,
   or pressure*volume work), I think she should both tolerate as well as
   benefit from a technically successful TV repair.  I do not think she
   has constrictive disease, as the cardiac MRI scan demonstrated a normal
   appearing pericardium.  However, if there is an element of constrictive
   pericardial disease, then this should be apparent during open heart
   surgery and could be addressed at that time.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (SHF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a peripherally inserted inferior vena cava (PIVC) line placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's heart failure is causing fluid overload, leading to symptoms such as shortness of breath and edema. This condition can be managed through aggressive diuretic therapy and ultrafiltration (UF).
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to volume depletion, anemia, or blood loss. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) has helped improve her condition, and she will continue to be monitored for any signs of further blood loss.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF), stage III chronic renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, leading to the accumulation of waste products in her body. This condition needs to be closely monitored, and the patient may require dialysis.
4. Bacteremia: The patient has developed an infection in her bloodstream, as indicated by the presence of bacteria in her urine and blood cultures. She is currently receiving treatment with vancomycin and ciprof"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension, and has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and a perforated foreign object (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. 

The patient has been transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) due to her inability to increase urine output despite an aggressive diuretic regimen. She is currently being evaluated for the possibility of tricuspid valve replacement.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 84 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 110/43 to 73/36 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.

The patient's physical examination reveals anasarca, crackles in the lower left lung lobe, mild distended right lower quadrant with no rebound or guarding, and peripheral edema in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she is alert and oriented, with appropriate speech and behavior.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, slightly elevated platelet count,"

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diuresis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - Continue midodrine
   - UOP on her own kept her at even balance over the day and night
   yesterday.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Getting better
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on
   vanc and cipro
   -consider broadening gram neg coverage to aztreonam if pt decompensates
   -renally dose vanc
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi
   - PIV x2
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement. The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) and is resistant to diuretic therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Decompensated Diastolic Failure: The patient's resistance to diuretic therapy suggests poor forward flow due to right heart failure, which may worsen diastolic dysfunction. This can lead to further fluid accumulation and potential cardiac arrest.
2. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels are increasing, indicating worsening renal function. This may progress to end-stage renal disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Sepsis: The patient has grown bacteria from urine and blood cultures, suggesting a possible infection. If left untreated, this could lead to sepsis and organ dysfunction.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has chronic persistent atrial fibrillation. If not controlled, it can lead to increased risk of stroke and heart failure.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Although stable currently, there is a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Re-bleeding or complications from the underlying condition (such as ulcer disease) could occur.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient has shown improvement post ultrafiltration (UF) and aggressive fluid removal. However, ongoing monitoring is required to ensure continued improvement.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to volume depletion in the setting of diarrhea. Anemia suggests blood loss, possibly from her history of ulcerative colitis. Improved with packed red blood cell transfusions and minimal pressor use. Monitoring hematocrit levels is important, and further gastrointestinal evaluation may be necessary if the levels decrease.
3. ARF (acute renal failure), stage III chronic renal failure: Improvement is observed, but ongoing monitoring is required.
4. Sepsis: The patient grew serratia from urine and coagulase-negative staphylococci from blood cultures and catheter tip cultures. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin. Broadening gram-negative coverage to aztreonam may be considered if the patient decompensates, and vancomycin dosage should be adjusted based on renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   62 year old woman with severe diastolic CHF and R systolic HF admitted
   for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension with long hospital course
   complicated by volume overload (ongoing), worsening renal failure
   (ongoing), GI bleeding (stable), PFO repair with endovascular device,
   transferred from cardiology floor to CCU failing to increase UOP on
   aggressive diuretic regimen.
   .
   # Acute decompensated diastolic failure: Pt resistant to diuresis.
   Suspect not diuresing due to poor forward flow from right heart failure
   (left heart seeing low filling volumes). With gross fluid overload
   dilated right ventricle is likely worsening diastolic dysfunction and
   removing the excess fluid is likely the only way the patient will
   improve clinically.
   - Continue midodrine
   - UOP on her own kept her at even balance over the day and night
   yesterday.
   .
   # ARF, stage III chronic renal failure: Cr continued to trend up over
   the course of yesterday. Lytes suggested pre-renal. Likely secondary to
   poor forward flow from heart failure; urine microscopy not suggestive
   of ATN. has been on CRRT before.
   - Getting better
   - Renally dose meds and avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # ?Sepsis: Pt grew serratia from urine and CoNS from blood cx and
   catheter tip cx. Also having diarrhea since on the floor. currently on
   vanc and cipro
   -consider broadening gram neg coverage to aztreonam if pt decompensates
   -renally dose vanc
   .
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Patient has chronic persistent AF.
   - Control rate with beta blocker to allow as much diastolic filling of
   hypertrophied LV as possible.
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # GI BLEEDING: Stable now. History of UC. Status post clipping/
   injection of ulcers, baseline hct mid-upper 20s. All future GI
   procedures should be done through Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] her primary GI doctor.
   - Daily hct.
   - No need to guaiac stool, as may expect slight residual bleeding
   post-procedure.
   - Continue ppi
   - PIV x2
   - Active T+S
   - Transfuse for hct < 22
   .
   # s/p PFO closure: s/p percutaneous closure [**2108-3-14**] without
   complication. Echo [**3-15**] shows mild residual shunt.
   - Repeat echo in 8 weeks
   - Not on aspirin due to GI bleed
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Likely from volume overload due to heart failure.
   - Trend lytes
   - 1000ml fluid restriction
   .
   # Diarrhea: [**Month (only) 60**] be from blood in GI tract still. Also consider C diff
   given prolonged hospitalization. No fevers, no evidence of infectious
   colitis on scope.
   - C Diff neg on [**3-22**]. will resend given new episode of diarrhea.
   - consider empirically starting flagyl

","The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. Her hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and percutaneous patent foramen ovale (PFO) repair with an endovascular device.

The patient is currently in the critical care unit (CCU) and is resistant to diuretic therapy for acute decompensated diastolic failure. She has a history of chronic renal failure, stage III, and her creatinine level continues to trend upward. She also has atrial fibrillation and a history of ulcerative colitis with GI bleeding.

The patient has grown serratia from urine and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) from blood cultures, indicating possible sepsis. She is currently on vancomycin and ciprofloxacin, but may require broadening of gram-negative coverage if she decompensates.

She has mild residual shunting after PFO closure and will undergo repeat echocardiography in 8 weeks. The patient is not on aspirin due to her history of GI bleeding. She also has hyponatremia likely due to volume overload and diuretic use, as well as diarrhea, which may be related to her GI bleeding or Clostridium difficile infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and a perforated ulcer (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. The patient was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) due to failing to increase urine output (UOP) on an aggressive diuretic regimen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's severe diastolic CHF may lead to acute decompensation, which can result in pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or cardiogenic shock.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to volume depletion from diarrhea and blood loss. If not properly managed, it can lead to organ hypoperfusion and ischemia.
3. Anemia: The patient's history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and ongoing blood loss may result in anemia, leading to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and potential tissue hypoxia.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function may progress to end-stage renal disease, requiring renal replacement therapy.
5. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream from urine, blood"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. She has a history of severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (HFrEF). She has been experiencing worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and anemia. The patient underwent percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement (PFO) repair with an endovascular device and was transferred from the cardiology floor to the critical care unit (CCU) due to her condition worsening despite aggressive diuretic therapy. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to fluid overload and pulmonary edema.
2. Hypotension: The patient may experience recurrent episodes of low blood pressure, potentially resulting in inadequate organ perfusion.
3. Anemia: The patient's anemia may worsen, leading to fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Chronic renal failure: The patient's kidney function may continue to decline, necessitating further management and potential dialysis.
5. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream increases the risk of sepsis and septic shock.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm disorder may persist or worsen, increasing the risk of thromboembolic events and hemodynamic instability.
7. GI bleeding:"

- The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure.
- She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension.
- She has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, GI bleeding, and a perforated foreign object (PFO) repair with endovascular device.

- She has acute decompensated diastolic failure, which improved after ultrafiltration (UF) and aggressive fluid removal.
- An echocardiogram showed evidence of improvement, and there is an ongoing evaluation of the possibility of tricuspid valve replacement.
- The patient also has chronic persistent atrial fibrillation, which is becoming more tachycardic as beta blockers have been held for hypotension.
- Rate control with a beta blocker will be restarted to allow as much diastolic filling of the hypertrophied left ventricle as possible.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and right-sided systolic heart failure (HFrEF). She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient has had a long hospital course complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and a percutaneous pulmonary valve (PFO) repair with an endovascular device. She underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) for massive fluid overload and was transferred back to the critical care unit (CCU) for hypotension and decreased hematocrit (Hct) with diarrhea. The patient's condition has improved post-ultrafiltration (UF) and aggressive fluid removal, as evidenced by an echocardiogram showing improvement. There is currently an evaluation of the possibility of transcatheter valve replacement (TVR). The patient will undergo a cardiac MRI today to assess right ventricular (RV) function and continue to monitor her volume status. She is also being continued on midodrine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's severe diastolic CHF may lead to further complications such as pulmonary edema or acute pulmonary hypertension.
2. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient's chronic persistent AF may result in embolic events or stroke if not adequately anticoag"

   [**Known firstname 3799**] is doing surprisingly well off pressors and off diuretics.  We
   can get her to [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 3 today and see how long it is before she triggers
   for low bp or low uop.  If she triggers, as I expect she will
   eventually, then we should proceed with our plan for tricuspid valve
   repair.  However, if she last a few consecutive days with a robust
   blood pressure, stable creatinine, and reasonable uop (with or without
   diuretics) thyen maybe we can actually get her home (and then we will
   wait and see how long it takes for her to get hospitalized again for

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old woman with severe diastolic heart failure and right-sided systolic heart failure. She was admitted for hypoxia, diarrhea, and hypotension. The patient's hospital course has been complicated by volume overload, worsening renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, and a prosthetic heart valve repair. She underwent continuous veno-venous hemofiltration for massive fluid overload and was transferred back to the cardiac care unit for hypotension and decreased hematocrit with diarrhea. Her current conditions include acute decompensated diastolic failure, atrial fibrillation, chronic renal failure, bacteremia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is currently on various medications and treatments, including midodrine, beta blockers, ciprofloxacin, heparin, and diuretics. Her code status is full code, and she may be discharged to the floor today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute decompensated diastolic failure: The patient's heart failure can lead to further deterioration in cardiac function, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's chronic persistent atrial fibrillation may progress, leading to an increased heart rate and potential complications like stroke or heart rhythm abnormalities.
3. Chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function can continue to progress, leading to further fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased toxicity from"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male with a history of chronic heart failure, acute renal failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, impaired muscle performance, and impaired knowledge. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 95/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is alert and oriented, but has anasarca (generalized swelling) and distended abdomen. There is also evidence of peripheral edema in the lower extremities. The patient's labs indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. The patient's blood glucose levels are stable. The patient has impaired kidney function and elevated liver enzymes. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated and there are crackles in the left lower lobe, which could indicate an underlying lung infection.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has reduced mobility due to anasarca and peripheral edema, which increases the risk of developing blood clots in the legs.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): If a DVT dislodges and travels to the lungs, it can lead to a potentially life-threatening PE.
4. Worsening Heart Failure:"
