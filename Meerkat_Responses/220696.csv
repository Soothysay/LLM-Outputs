","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old obese female with a history of asthma/copd and essential tremor. She presented initially to the emergency department unresponsive in the setting of a possible suicide attempt and was transferred for further management. The patient had a fall during which she hit her head but was ambulatory without any problems afterward. However, by the afternoon, she became difficult to arouse and remained in that state. She was intubated for unresponsiveness and a head CT showed no abnormalities. Toxicology screen revealed the presence of benzodiazepines, ethanol, barbiturates, and opiates, and Narcan had no effect. A chest X-ray showed right upper lobe pneumonia, and her CPK levels were elevated to 3000. She was given IV fluids and transferred to another hospital for further care.

Upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient's temperature was 100.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure was 114/66 mmHg, heart rate was 73 bpm, respiratory rate was 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 96% on Fio2 1.0. Nebulizations and bicarbonate drips were administered for presumed rhabdomyolysis, and Versed was given for agitation. The patient was also started on Flagyl and transferred to a specific hospital unit.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of COPD, asthma, obesity, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive after a fall, and a toxic screen showed positive for benzodiazepines, ethanol, barbiturates, and opiates. She had a negative head CT and was treated for pneumonia with avene and transferred to another hospital. In the ICU, she received nebs and analgesic for suspected aspiration pneumonia. She is currently on invasive ventilation, with a PSV mode set at 20 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. Her ABG results are within normal limits, and her vital signs are stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to the polysubstance overdose, underlying asthma, or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation is necessary, and adjustments to the ventilator settings may be required.
2. Unresponsiveness/Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness could be attributed to the polysubstance overdose. It is crucial to continue monitoring her closely for signs of withdrawal and obtain additional history from the family.
3. Cpk Elevation/Mild Rhabdomyolysis: The elevated Cpk levels suggest mild rhabdomyolysis. It is important to continue IV fluids, trend CK levels, and follow electrolytes."

 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   This is a 42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma,
   hypertension, and essential tremor who presents after being found
   unresponsive in setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide
   attempt with utox pos for BZ, barbs, EtOH.  Spiked to 102 this morning
   # Fever:  Likely [**2-4**] known PNA.  Currently on flagyl/levo.  Fever to
   102 this morning.  GPC on OSH blood cx
 bottles, awaiting speciation
   - will broaded coverage to Vanc for GPC and CTX  for community aquired
   PNA
   - continue levo
   - d/c flagyl as no clear evidence of anerobic PNA
 no cavitary lesion
   on CXR
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production
   - antibiotics as above for CAP coverage
   - start iv steroids for COPD exacerbation, will likely need po taper
   - start inhaled steroids
may not help in acute exacerbation but will
   need for ppx in future
   - attempt to wean pressure support
   - suctioning of secretions
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - will likely need psych c/s once more stable and may merit in patient
   pscyh placement
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 1659 from high of 3900
   - continue to trend CK and renal function

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive with a presumed suicide attempt and tested positive for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure, pneumonia, and polysubstance ingestion.

The patient has been placed on mechanical ventilation with pressure support and has been receiving sedation and analgesia. A left internal jugular (IJ) catheter was placed for access, and she was started on tube feeds. Her lactate level decreased from 1.6 to 1.0, and her CK level decreased from 3748 to 2233.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 135/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese status, normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion note, and wheezes. She is also sedated and unresponsive to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated WBC count, slightly low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Her electrolytes are within normal range, and her kidney function is also normal."

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
 MULTI LUMEN - START [**2132-1-4**] 04:45 PM
   - Patient had some blood-tinged vomit today.  Her Hct remained stable
   at 27.0 in the am and 29.4 in the afternoon.  GI was [**Name (NI) 161**], but did
   not feel that the bleeding was an acute issue and did not want to scope
   her this hospitalization unless it worsened.  IP was told about his and
   offered to do a scope to look at the PEG site if we want this (however
   this would not examine the entire abdomen and they don't think the
   blood is from the PEG site).  Her family is ok with her getting a scope
   if GI changes their mind.
   - Her tube feeds have been held given the bleeding and her meds were
   changed to IV.
   - CXR showed improving left retrocardiac opacity (thought to reflects a
   combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis); no evidence of
   aspiration.
   - Patient had elevated SBP's.  Was given an additional 5 mg IV
   metoprolol (in addition to 10 mg IV q6h), however her SBPs remained in
   the 180's to 190's (asymptomatic).  She was given 10 mg IV hydralazine
   and her metoprolol was increased to 15 mg IV q6h.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of suicide attempt, currently admitted to the ICU for pneumonia and aspiration. She has been experiencing elevated systolic blood pressures (SBP) ranging from 180's to 190's despite receiving IV metoprolol and hydralazine. The patient also has a PEG tube in place, which may not be the source of blood-tinged vomit. Her hemoglobin levels remain stable at 27.0 in the morning and 29.4 in the afternoon. The patient's tube feeds have been held due to bleeding, and she is receiving her medications intravenously. A chest X-ray showed improving left retrocardiac opacity, possibly due to a combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis, without evidence of aspiration.

The patient has multiple allergies, including Wellbutrin (Bupropion Hcl), red dye, and an unknown allergy. She is receiving various infusions and medications, including fentanyl, midazolam (Versed), lansoprazole (Prevacid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 38.3 C (100.9 F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/78 mmHg to 91/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Fluid balance shows an overall intake of 5,895 mL and output of 872 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 5,023 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 717 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 26 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values are not provided.

During the physical examination, the patient appears to be in no acute distress, with symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion, and wheezes and rhonchi in the chest. Her abdomen is soft, non-tender, and bowel sounds are present. She has absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurologically, she responds to verbal stimuli, is sedated, and has not been assessed for movement or muscle tone. Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin-T levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment includes suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, pneumonia, and aspiration. Her plan of care involves ICU nutrition, glycemic control, line management, DVT prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU."

 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   This is a 42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma,
   hypertension, and essential tremor who presents after being found
   unresponsive in setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**].
   # Respiratory failure:
   Likely a component of hypercarbic respiratory failure due to
   oversedation from combination of alcohol, benzodiazapines,
   barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by patient. Also
   complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in addition to the
   finding of right lung opacity in setting of leukocytosis, consistent
   with an aspiration event. Of note, admission CXR shows that ET tube has
   tip at level of carina.
   - Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for 5 day course
   - Metronidazole 500 mg Q8H for 7 day course
   - Pull back ET tube 4 cm and repeat CXR.
   - Check resistance of ventilation and attempt to minimize vent settings
   to a lower pressure support level
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - Contact husband to find out what potential medications to ingest are
   at home
   - Watch closely for signs of benzo or EtOH withdrawal as hospital
   course proceeds
   # Elevated CK:
   Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated to 3748 in
   setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. At this time creatinine
   0.8.
   - Trend CK
   - [**Hospital1 **] potassium, phosphate, LDH as CK resolves
   - Hydrate with IVF + bicarb x 1 L and then hydrate with NS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive after a fall on [**2132-1-2**]. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There are concerns about pneumonia and aspiration due to her history of asthma and COPD, as well as the finding of right lung opacity with leukocytosis. The endotracheal tube tip is at the level of the carina on the admission CXR. The patient has also ingested multiple substances including alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and possibly other medications. Her CK level was initially elevated but has decreased since then. She is being closely monitored for signs of benzo or EtOH withdrawal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to oversedation from ingested medications and her underlying medical conditions such as asthma and COPD. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right lung opacity and leukocytosis raises concerns for pneumonia, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory status.
3. Aspiration: Given the patient's history of asthma and COPD, there is a risk of aspiration, especially while she is on mechanical ventilation.
4. Drug Withdrawal: The patient's ingestion of benzod"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASTHMA/COPD exacerbation, pneumonia; found unresponsive with
   polysubstance overdose (apparent suicide attempt).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial; asthma/COPD with exacerbation,
   and new pneumonia (probable aspiration).  Copious secretions liklely
   contributing to persistent need for ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support, and work towards SBT.  Monitor SaO2.
   ASTHMA/COPD -- active exacerbation;  aspiration contributing to
   exacerbation.  Plan to optimize medications, add steroids (iv and
   inhaled).  Monitor exam.
   RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATE -- aspiration, likely pneumonia.  Plan expand
   coverage.
   BACTEREMIA -- gram positive cocci.  Unclear whether related to
   pneumonia or unrelated (possible contamination).  Plan cover with Vanco
   pending identification.
   POLYSUBSTANCE OVERDOSE -- suicide attempt.  Will need Psychiatry
   evaluation (contact now) and 24-hour sitter once extubated.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   UNRESPONSIVENESS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improving.
   CPK ELEVATION -- resollving.  Monitor CPK.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate medical intervention.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of a right lung infiltrate suggests the possibility of pneumonia, which can further compromise the patient's respiratory function.

3. Bacteremia: The detection of gram-positive cocci in the blood culture indicates bacteremia, which may be related to the pneumonia or unrelated (possibly due to contamination). This can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly.

4. Polysubstance overdose: The patient's unresponsiveness is attributed to a polysubstance overdose, likely an apparent suicide attempt. Monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and psychiatric evaluation are necessary upon extubation.

5. Asthma/COPD exacerbation: The patient's asthma/COPD is actively exacerbated, possibly due to aspiration contributing to the worsening of the condition. Optimizing medications and adding steroids (iv and inhaled) will be crucial in managing this complication.

6. Multi-lumen catheter-related complications: The use of a multi-lumen catheter increases the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections or thrombosis.

7. Critical care complications: Given the patient's critically ill state, there is a risk of developing ICU-acquired complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASTHMA/COPD exacerbation, pneumonia; found unresponsive with
   polysubstance overdose (apparent suicide attempt)l
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial; asthma/COPD with exacerbation,
   and new pneumonia (probable aspiration).  Copious secretions liklely
   contributing to persistent need for ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support, and work towards SBT.  Monitor SaO2.
   ASTHMA/COPD -- active exacerbation;  aspiration contributing to
   exacerbation.  Plan to optimize medications, add steroids (iv and
   inhaled).  Monitor exam.
   RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATE -- aspiration, likely pneumonia.  Plan expand
   coverage.
   BACTEREMIA -- gram positive cocci.  Unclear whether related to
   pneumonia or unrelated (possible contamination).
   POLYSUBSTANCE OVERDOSE -- suicide attempt.  Will need Psychiatry
   evaluation (contact now) and 24-hour sitter once extubated.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   UNRESPONSIVENESS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improving.
   CPK ELEVATION -- resollving.  MOnito4r CPK.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma,
   hypertension, and essential tremor who presents after being found
   unresponsive in setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide
   attempt with utox pos for BZ, barbs, EtOH.  Spiked to 102 this morning
   # Fever:  Likely [**2-4**] known PNA.  Currently on flagyl/levo.  Fever to
   102 this morning.  GPC on OSH blood cx
 bottles, awaiting speciation
   - will broaded coverage to Vanc for GPC and CTX  for community aquired
   PNA
   - continue levo
   - d/c flagyl as no clear evidence of anerobic PNA
 no cavitary lesion
   on CXR
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production
   - antibiotics as above for CAP coverage
   - start iv steroids for COPD exacerbation, will likely need po taper
   - start inhaled steroids
may not help in acute exacerbation but will
   need for ppx in future
   - attempt to wean pressure support
   - suctioning of secretions
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - will likely need psych c/s once more stable and may merit in patient
   pscyh placement
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 1659 from high of 3900
   - continue to trend CK and renal function

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive with a presumed suicide attempt and had toxic levels of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol in her system. The patient presented with fever, leukocytosis, right lung opacity, and respiratory failure. She was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by a possible pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and polysubstance ingestion. Her CK levels were elevated but have been trending down. She is currently receiving supportive care and antibiotics for suspected community-acquired pneumonia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infection. If not appropriately treated, it could lead to worsening of her respiratory status and potentially sepsis.
2. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current symptoms of increased sputum production and wheezing indicate an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. If not managed effectively, this could lead to respiratory failure and potentially death.
3. Polysubstance Overdose: The patient ingested multiple substances, including benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. While she has been stabilized, there is a risk of further complications from these substances, such as liver damage or cardiac issues.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma,
   hypertension, and essential tremor who presents after being found
   unresponsive in setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide
   attempt with utox pos for BZ, barbs, EtOH.  Spiked to 102 this morning
   # Fever:  Likely multifactorial with PNA as well as GPCs in OSH labs
   bottles on [**2131-1-2**].  Pt continues to be febrile here.  Antibiotic
   coverage broadened yesterday to Vanc, Ceftriaxone, levaquin for
   possible PNA or blood infection.  Flagyl stopped as no clear evidence
   of anaerobic PNA.  No reason to suspect pseudomonas at this point as pt
   was not recently hospitalized.
   - Vancomycin day #2 (started [**2127-1-4**])
   - Ceftriaxone, Levaquin day #3 (started [**2131-1-3**])
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   - f/u micro data from OSH
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production
   - antibiotics as above for CAP coverage
   - PO steroid taper with Prednisone 60mg today, starting 40mg PO
   tomorrow
   - beclomethasone inhaled steriods for long-term benefit
   - attempt to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - suctioning of secretions
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - will likely need psych c/s once more stable and may merit in patient
   pscyh placement
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 1659 from high of 3900
   - continue to trend CK and renal function

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive after a presumed suicide attempt and had a positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. Upon presentation to the ICU, she was febrile with a temperature of 102.1°F. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin. The patient also has respiratory failure, likely due to a combination of oversedation from medication ingestion, asthma exacerbation, and possible aspiration. She is receiving supportive care and her condition is being closely monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infection. It is important to continue monitoring her vital signs and lab results for any signs of worsening infection.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be a result of oversedation from medication ingestion, asthma exacerbation, and possible aspiration. Close monitoring of her oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential. Weaning off ventilator settings as tolerated will be attempted.

3. COPD Exacerbation: The patient's history of COPD and the current symptoms indicate an exacerbation of her condition. This can lead to increased shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. Treatment with"

   Assessment and Plan
   ASTHMA/COPD -- exacerbation, pneumonia; found unresponsive with
   polysubstance overdose (apparent suicide attempt).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial; asthma/COPD with exacerbation,
   and new pneumonia (probable aspiration).  Copious secretions liklely
   contributing to persistent need for ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support, and work towards SBT.  Monitor SaO2.
   ASTHMA/COPD -- active exacerbation;  aspiration contributing to
   exacerbation.  Plan to optimize medications, add steroids (iv and
   inhaled).  Monitor exam.
   RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATE -- aspiration, likely pneumonia.  Continue
   expanded antimicrobial coverage.
   BACTEREMIA -- gram positive cocci.  Unclear whether related to
   pneumonia or unrelated (possible contamination).  Plan cover with Vanco
   pending identification.
   POLYSUBSTANCE OVERDOSE -- suicide attempt.  Will need Psychiatry
   evaluation (contact now) and 24-hour sitter once extubated.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   UNRESPONSIVENESS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improving.  Despondent.
   Continue to taper sedation as tolerated.
   CPK ELEVATION -- resolving.  Likely due to fall.  Monitor CPK.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via NGT.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and intubation. They were found unresponsive with a suspected polysubstance overdose, likely a suicide attempt. The patient has a history of asthma/COPD exacerbation and pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration. Bacteremia caused by gram-positive cocci is also present. The patient's mental status is improving, but they remain despondent. There is a concern for withdrawal symptoms once extubated. The patient's nutritional support is being provided through tube feeding via NG tube.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and pneumonia pose ongoing respiratory complications. These include worsening lung infection, increased secretions, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's cardiovascular system may be affected by the asthma/COPD exacerbation, leading to potential cardiac complications such as arrhythmias or heart failure.
3. Infection-related Complications: The presence of bacteremia and pneumonia increases the risk of systemic infections, which can lead to sepsis and septic shock if not promptly managed.
4. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of a polysubstance overdose raise concerns for potential neurological complications, including seizures or long-term cognitive impairment.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation can lead to stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding.

","The patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU for polysubstance overdose, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient's chief complaint is unresponsiveness with a history of asthma/COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and a suspected suicide attempt. 

The patient has been on mechanical ventilator support due to respiratory failure, which is multifactorial including asthma/COPD exacerbation and new pneumonia (probable aspiration). The patient's condition requires continued mechanical ventilator support, and they are being worked towards a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). Monitoring of SaO2 and striving for a negative fluid balance with Lasix today is planned.

The patient's asthma/COPD is presumed to have been exacerbated on admission with concurrent aspiration. The patient has been on steroids but is not wheezing at all today. A rapid taper of steroids will be finished in 2 days.

The patient has a right lung infiltrate due to aspiration, likely pneumonia. They are being treated with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and levofloxacin for a total 8-day course.

There is a concern for bacteremia with one-quarter bottle coag-negative Staphylococcus in the open surgical wound (OSH) culture, which is likely a contaminant.

The patient attempted suicide with a polysubstance overdose. They will require a Psychiatry evaluation (contact now) and a 24-hour sitter once extubated. Withdrawal should be monitored.

The patient has been unresponsive and altered in mental status, but improving. They are despondent. Tapering of sedation as tolerated will continue.

The patient has had a CPK elevation that is resolving, likely due to a fall. CPK levels should be monitored.

Nutritional support will be provided through tube feeding via nasogastric tube (NGT).

ICU care includes glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, lines (20-gauge and multi-lumen), prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with elevation of head of bed (HOB) and mouth care. 

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   ASTHMA/COPD -- exacerbation, pneumonia; found unresponsive with
   polysubstance overdose (apparent suicide attempt).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial; asthma/COPD with exacerbation,
   and new pneumonia (probable aspiration).  Copious secretions- possible
   supraglottic in origin vs reflection of pulm edema- liklely
   contributing to persistent need for ETT.  Continue mechanical
   ventilator support, and work towards SBT.  Monitor SaO2. Strive for neg
   fluid balance w/ Lasix today.
   ASTHMA/COPD -- Presumed exacerbation on admission w/ concomm.
   aspiration. On steroids but not wheezing at all today. Rapid taper to
   finish in 2d.
   RIGHT LUNG INFILTRATE -- aspiration, likely pneumonia.  On vanco +
   ceftriax + levoflox for total 8d course.
   BACTEREMIA -- OSH cx now with 1/4 bottle coag neg staph, likely
   contaminant.
   POLYSUBSTANCE OVERDOSE -- suicide attempt.  Will need Psychiatry
   evaluation (contact now) and 24-hour sitter once extubated.  Monitor
   for withdrawal.
   UNRESPONSIVENESS/ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- improving.  Despondent.
   Continue to taper sedation as tolerated.
   CPK ELEVATION -- resolving.  Likely due to fall.  Monitor CPK.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via NGT.

","The patient is an ICU day 3 for polysubstance overdose, fevers, and respiratory failure. The patient has a history of asthma/COPD exacerbation with probable aspiration, pneumonia, bacteremia, and unresponsiveness/alt mental status due to a suicide attempt. The patient also has right lung infiltrate from aspiration and likely pneumonia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.9°F (39.4°C), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 132/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilator support and is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) soon. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and troponin T levels, while other lab values are within normal range. Imaging shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Microbiology results indicate negative cultures for nasal/gastric tube tip. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to asthma/COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, and aspiration; continued mechanical ventilator support and work towards SBT; monitoring SaO2 and striving for negative fluid balance with Lasix today. Other plans include presumed exacerbation of asthma/COPD with concomitant aspiration, rapid taper of steroids, treatment for right lung infiltrate likely due to pneumonia, and evaluation for polysubstance overdose and withdrawal.

 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and
   essential tremor who presents after being found unresponsive in setting
   of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide attempt with utox pos for
   BZ, barbs, EtOH now with continued fevers.
   # Fever:  Likely multifactorial with PNA as well as GPCs which grew out
   as coag neg staph in OSH labs
 bottles on [**2131-1-2**].  Pt continues to be
   febrile here.  Antibiotic coverage broadened two days ago to Vanc,
   Ceftriaxone, levaquin for possible PNA or blood infection.  Flagyl was
   stopped as no clear evidence of anaerobic PNA but restarted this
   morning given fever.  No reason to suspect pseudomonas at this point as
   pt was not recently hospitalized. Will complete a total of 7 days of
   treatment starting from today, lat dose [**2131-1-14**]
   - Vancomycin day #4 (started [**2127-1-4**])
   - Ceftriaxone, Levaquin day #5 (started [**2131-1-3**])
   - added Flgayl as above 500mg q8h
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   - f/u micro data from OSH, by reprot it was coag neg staph which would
   likely represent a contaminant
   - urine cx neg x2, sputum neg x2, blood cx [**Last Name (LF) 3824**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] f/u
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production.  Her CXR shows volume overload yesterday.
   RISB <100, will attempt to extubate today
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   - PO steroid taper with Prednisone 40mg today, 20mg PO tomorrow
   - beclomethasone inhaled steriods for long-term benefit
   - suctioning of secretions
   - extubate as above
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - psych c/s after extubation, will need 1:1 sitter
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 794 yesterday from high of 3900

   Assessment and Plan
 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and
   essential tremor who presents after being found unresponsive in setting
   of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide attempt with utox pos for
   BZ, barbs, EtOH now with continued fevers.
   # Fever:  Likely multifactorial with PNA as well as GPCs which grew out
   as coag neg staph in OSH labs
 bottles on [**2131-1-2**].  Pt continues to be
   febrile here.  Antibiotic coverage broadened two days ago to Vanc,
   Ceftriaxone, levaquin for possible PNA or blood infection.  Flagyl
   stopped as no clear evidence of anaerobic PNA.  No reason to suspect
   pseudomonas at this point as pt was not recently hospitalized.
   - Vancomycin day #4 (started [**2127-1-4**])
   - Ceftriaxone, Levaquin day #5 (started [**2131-1-3**])
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   - f/u micro data from OSH, by reprot it was coag neg staph which would
   likely represent a contaminant
   - Would consider adding back flaygl for anerobic coverage given the
   patient
s continued fevers on her current antibiotic regimen and risk
   for aspriation if she becomes unstable, for now will continue with the
   above antibiotics.
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production.  Her CXR shows volume overload and she is
   9.2 L positive for LOS.
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   - Will given 20 mg IV lasix today for gentle diuresis with a goal of
   [**1-3**].5 L negative today.
   - PO steroid taper with Prednisone 40mg today, 20mg PO tomorrow
   - beclomethasone inhaled steriods for long-term benefit
   - attempt to wean vent settings as tolerated
   - as she was becoming apneic with pressure support, will need to wean
   sedation.  Given her history of benzo use as an outpatient, will likely
   need to start standing benzo while weaning sedation to prevent
   withdrawal.  Will start 10 mg of valium [**Hospital1 **].
   - suctioning of secretions
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - will likely need psych c/s once more stable and may merit inpatient
   pscyh placement
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 794 yesterday from high of 3900

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She was found unresponsive in a setting of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide attempt. The patient has been experiencing fevers and is suspected to have pneumonia (PNA) as well as rhabdomyolysis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/61 mmHg to 135/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's medical history includes polysubstance ingestion with positive results for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol on presentation. However, only benzodiazepines and barbiturates were positive on urine toxic screen at the time of transfer to the ICU. The patient has been on various antibiotics including metronidazole, ceftriaxone, levaquin, vancomycin, and Flagyl for suspected PNA or blood infection. 

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes including asthma/COPD exacerbation and new pneumonia (probable aspiration). The patient also has a persistent fever, which is likely due to pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a history of substance abuse and attempted suicide by overdose. The patient is currently unresponsive and has altered mental status, but it is improving. There is also evidence of recent trauma with elevated CPK levels, likely due to a fall. The patient requires nutritional support through total parenteral nutrition (TF) via nasogastric tube (NGT). The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 127/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and a respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 51. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), and elevated platelet count (Plt). Other lab values are within normal limits. The patient is currently extub"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.
- The patient has a history of asthma/COPD with an exacerbation and new pneumonia (probable aspiration).
- The patient has been experiencing fevers and is being treated for pneumonia.
- The patient attempted suicide by a substance overdose and requires Psychiatry evaluation.
- The patient is showing signs of unresponsiveness and altered mental status but is improving.
- The patient's CPK levels were elevated but are now resolving.
- The patient requires nutritional support through a TF via NGT.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial respiratory failure due to asthma/COPD exacerbation and new pneumonia. This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent fevers indicate ongoing infection, which may progress to sepsis or develop into a more severe form of pneumonia.
3. Substance Overdose: The patient's substance overdose can lead to various complications such as respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, liver or kidney damage, and withdrawal symptoms.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's unresponsiveness and altered mental status could be due to sedation, intoxication, or underlying neurological issues. This requires close monitoring for any signs of deterioration or improvement.
5. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support through a TF via NGT. If this support is inadequate or if there are complications"

   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production.  Her CXR shows volume overload yesterday.

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor. She presents after being found unresponsive with a presumed suicide attempt. The patient has been intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. The patient also has evidence of rhabdomyolysis, polysubstance ingestion, and an elevated CK level. She requires close monitoring and management for various complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. It is important to monitor her response to the treatment and watch for any signs of worsening infection.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which was likely a result of oversedation from the combination of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other unknown medications. There is also a possibility of exacerbation of her pre-existing asthma and COPD. Close monitoring of her respiratory status is essential.
3. Aspiration: The presence of leukocytosis, increased sputum production, and right lung opacity suggests an aspiration event. This can lead to further lung complications and should be closely monitored.
4. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has evidence of rhabdomyolysis, which can cause kidney damage. Monitoring of her renal function and ensuring adequate fluid hydration is crucial"

","The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor who was found unresponsive in a setting of fall with presumed suicide attempt. She presented with continued fevers and tested positive for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and alcohol. She was intubated and placed on invasive ventilation but successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's current conditions include:

1. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient has elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indicating muscle breakdown. This may be due to her polysubstance ingestion and prolonged immobilization.

2. Suicidality/Suicide Attempt: The patient has a history of attempted suicide, and there is concern for ongoing suicidal ideation. She denies killing herself and wishes to go home. Psychiatric evaluation is planned once she is no longer delirious.

3. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has a low-grade fever and increased sputum production, suggesting a possible pneumonia. She also has leukocytosis, which could indicate an aspiration event. Initial respiratory failure was likely due to hypercarbic respiratory failure from oversedation and her history of asthma and COPD. She is now maintaining her airway but still has some secretions.

4. Polysubstance Ingestion: The patient tested positive for benzodiazepines, barbiturates,"

   Assessment and Plan
 RHABDOMYOLYSIS
 SUICIDALITY / SUICIDE ATTEMPT
 PNEUMONIA, ASPIRATION
   42 year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and
   essential tremor who presents after being found unresponsive in setting
   of fall on [**2132-1-2**] with presumed suicide attempt with utox pos for
   BZ, barbs, EtOH now with continued fevers.
   # Fever:  Likely multifactorial with PNA as well as GPCs which grew out
   as coag neg staph in OSH labs
 bottles on [**2131-1-2**].  Pt continues to be
   febrile here.  Antibiotic coverage broadened two days ago to Vanc,
   Ceftriaxone, levaquin for possible PNA or blood infection.  Flagyl was
   stopped as no clear evidence of anaerobic PNA but restarted this
   morning given fever.  No reason to suspect pseudomonas at this point as
   pt was not recently hospitalized. Will complete a total of 7 days of
   treatment starting from today, lat dose [**2131-1-14**]
   - Vancomycin day #4 (started [**2127-1-4**])
   - Ceftriaxone, Levaquin day #5 (started [**2131-1-3**])
   - added Flgayl as above 500mg q8h
   - trend fever curve and WBC count
   - f/u micro data from OSH, by reprot it was coag neg staph which would
   likely represent a contaminant
   - urine cx neg x2, sputum neg x2, blood cx [**Last Name (LF) 3824**], [**First Name3 (LF) 124**] f/u
   # Respiratory failure:  Initially likely a component of hypercarbic
   respiratory failure due to oversedation from combination of alcohol,
   benzodiazapines, barbiturates, and other unknown meds ingested by
   patient. Also complicating could be her history of asthma and COPD in
   addition to the finding of right lung opacity in setting of
   leukocytosis, consistent with an aspiration event.  Likely a
   significant component of COPD exacerbation with fever, leukocytosis and
   increased sputum production.  Her CXR shows volume overload yesterday.
   RISB <100, will attempt to extubate today
   - antibiotics as above for PNA
   - PO steroid taper with Prednisone 40mg today, 20mg PO tomorrow
   - beclomethasone inhaled steriods for long-term benefit
   - suctioning of secretions
   - extubate as above
   # Polysubstance ingestion:
   Patient with OSH tox screen significant for benzos, barbiturates, and
   alcohol upon presentation. At transfer to our ED had only benzos and
   barbiturates positive on urine tox screen, with both negative on serum
   tox.
   - Supportive care
   - social work c/s for family and patient
   - psych c/s after extubation, will need 1:1 sitter
   # Elevated CK: Upon presentation to our ED, patient's CK was elevated
   to 3748 in setting of a normal MBI, and negative troponin. CK
   trending down to 794 yesterday from high of 3900

","Summary:
The patient is a 42-year-old female with a history of COPD, asthma, hypertension, and essential tremor who presented after being found unresponsive in a setting of fall with presumed suicide attempt. She was intubated upon arrival due to respiratory failure and subsequently developed pneumonia and aspiration. The patient has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for possible PNA or blood infection. She also had polysubstance ingestion and is being managed with supportive care. Her elevated CK levels are being monitored.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient's fever and leukocytosis, along with the presence of copious secretions, suggest an ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the patient's response should be closely monitored.
2. Aspiration: The patient's history of COPD and asthma, combined with the finding of right lung opacity, indicates a high risk of aspiration. Monitoring for worsening respiratory status and secretions is essential.
3. Rhabdomyolysis: The patient's elevated CK levels suggest muscle breakdown, which can lead to complications such as kidney damage. Regular monitoring of renal function is necessary.
4. Suicidality/Suicide Attempt: The patient's history of a presumed suicide attempt raises concerns about ongoing risk. Close psychiatric evaluation and monitoring for suicidal thoughts or behaviors are required.
5. Fluid Overload: The patient's volume overload as seen on the chest X-ray may contribute to respiratory distress."
