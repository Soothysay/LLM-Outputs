   Fluid analysis / Other labs: Immunoglobulin G 506* mg/dL (normal:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 10254**])
   Imaging: neck ultrasound: 1. Left internal jugular vein and left
   subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
   2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
   posterior
   aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
   is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
   free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
   These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
   be related to intubated state).
   Microbiology: blood cx c gpcs in pairs and chains from day of admission
   -HIV negative, sent Immunoglobulin panel

 ANXIETY
   19 year old female presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure in the
   context of fever, myalgias, and headache found to have pneumonia and
   gram positive cocci in chains in blood.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Ultimate etiology thought due to
   primary process (likely infection) affecting the lung parenchyma.
   Given dense consolidative process appearance is more suggestive of
   bacterial pneumonia than viral process but such predictions are not
   specific.  Given pattern of positivity of blood cultures most likely
   etiology would by acute pneumococcal pneumonia.  Pt able to be
   extubated yesterday.
   -Treat presumed pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftriaxone (likely can
   narrow but will await final culture and sensitivities.)
   -Continue viral medications until antigens return negative
   2. Infection: Aside from pneumonic source other possible causes could
   include urine versus CNS infection.  For the moment we are empirically
   covering with CNS dosing and unfortunately were unable to get CSF
   fluid.  Given evidence for other cause of critical illness will
   continue to treat for pneumonia and monitor.
   -surveillance cultures
   -continue antibiotics
   3. Pt has severe iron deficiency anemia
   -will give PO iron and colace.
   -would consider iv iron except that pt is infected
   4. PPX: SC heparin.
   5.  FEN: regular diet, could consider restart home citalopram and
   adderal soon

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 19-year-old female presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has gram-positive cocci in chains in her blood. The patient was initially treated with invasive ventilation but was able to be extubated yesterday.

The patient's fever, myalgias, and headache suggest an infectious process affecting the lung parenchyma. The dense consolidative process appearance on imaging is more suggestive of bacterial pneumonia rather than a viral process. Blood cultures have shown gram-positive cocci in chains, indicating a likely etiology of acute pneumococcal pneumonia.

The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone for presumed pneumonia. Viral medications are also being continued until viral antigens return negative. The patient's infection is being monitored, and surveillance cultures have been obtained.

The patient also has severe iron deficiency anemia and is being given oral iron and colace. Prophylactic heparin is being administered due to prolonged immobilization.

Overall, the potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening respiratory failure, sepsis secondary to bacterial pneumonia, and potential thromboembolic events due to prolonged immobilization. It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, infection parameters, and coagulation profile."

   Imaging: neck ultrasound: 1. Left internal jugular vein and left
   subclavian vein are patent with normal flow characteristics.
   2. Small volume lymph nodes seen in left supraclavicular fossa and
   posterior
   aspect of left side of neck, also seen on recent CT scan.
   TTE: The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. Left
   ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic
   function are normal (LVEF >55%). The estimated cardiac index is normal
   (>=2.5L/min/m2). Transmitral and tissue Doppler imaging suggests normal
   diastolic function, and a normal left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with
   borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
   regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
   trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. There
   is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild right ventricular cavity enlargement with low normal
   free wall motion. Borderline pulonary artery systolic hypertension.
   These findings are suggestive of a primary pulmonary process (or could
   be related to intubated state).
   Microbiology: blood cx c gpcs in pairs and chains from day of admission
   -HIV negative, sent Immunoglobulin panel
   -respiratory viral antigen negative from swab and BAL, awaiting culture
   until take off respiratory precautions; still on H1N1 treatment
   ECG: -neck ultrasound shows normal flow through int jug and subclav,
   some LNs
   -echo shows no vegetations; just pulmonary artery HTN

   19 year old female presenting with hypoxic respiratory failure in the
   context of fever, myalgias, and headache found to have pneumonia and
   gram positive cocci in chains in blood.
   1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: Ultimate etiology thought due to
   primary process (likely infection) affecting the lung parenchyma.
   Given dense consoladative process appearance is more suggestive of
   bacterial pneumonia than viral process but such predictions are not
   specific.  Given pattern of positivity of blood cultures most likely
   etiology would by acute pneumococcal pneumonia.  Pt able to be
   extubated yesterday.
   -Treat presumed pneumonia with vancomycin and ceftriaxone (likely can
   narrow but will await final culture and sensitivities.)
   -Continue viral medications until antigens return negative
   2. Infection: Aside from pneumonic source other possible causes could
   include urine versus CNS infection.  For the moment we are empirically
   covering with CNS dosing and unfortunately were unable to get CSF
   fluid.  Given evidence for other cause of critical illness will
   continue to treat for pneumonia and monitor.
   -surveillance cultures
   -continue antibiotics

","Summary:
The patient is a 19-year-old female who presented with hypoxic respiratory failure, fever, myalgias, and headache. She was found to have pneumonia and gram-positive cocci in chains in her blood. She was treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone, and her condition improved enough for her to be extubated. However, she still requires close monitoring and further treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ineffective coping: The patient may experience difficulty coping with her illness, leading to increased stress and anxiety.
2. Electrolyte & fluid disorder, other: The patient's fluid balance and electrolyte levels should be closely monitored and managed to prevent any imbalances that could affect her recovery.
3. Pneumonia, other: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and it is important to continue treating it appropriately to prevent worsening of symptoms or complications.
4. Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain): The patient reported chest pain, and pain management should be implemented to alleviate her discomfort.
5. Anxiety: The patient exhibited agitation and demanded to be transferred, indicating potential anxiety related to her hospital stay. Psychological support and reassurance should be provided.
6. Respiratory failure: Although the patient was able to be extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if her pneumonia worsens or if she develops any other respiratory complications.
