The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated congestive heart failure (CHF), amyloid lesions, admitted on 12/10 for septic left wrist washout, complicated by new paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (aflutter), methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) endocarditis with new aortic regurgitation (AR)/mitral regurgitation (MR) post 6-week antibiotic therapy, right hip fracture (fx) status post hemi-arthroplasty on 1/11 with revision on 1/26, and ischemic colitis status post hemicolectomy with ostomy from 12/4-6. The patient presented with ongoing fevers, hypotension in the setting of right hip hardware removal, and bleeding from the wound site.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, likely due to blood loss from the wound site and septic physiology caused by bacteremia in the setting of right hip hardware removal.
2. Septic Shock: The initial high mixed venous oxygen (MV02) implies septic shock, indicating inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation.
3. Right Hip Infection: The patient has a history of right hip infection after hemiarthro"

   59 yo male with admission to Ortho Service for removal of right hip
   prosthesis.  In post operative period patient with hypotension
   requiring admission to ICU.  Patient with prolonged hospital course
   complicated by A-Fib, bowel ischemia and hip replacement suspected to
   be localizing focus of persistent infection.  In the post operative
   period patient did have significant hypotension noted.  This is in the
   setting of ongoing brisk drainage from surgical site--blood loss
   leading to hypovolemic shock is susptected.
   1)Shock--Hypovolemic is being considered most likely given exam and
   ongoing blood loss.  This in the setting of significant MR will likely
   lead to persistent and difficult process to move to stabilization.
   -Levophed to continue and will wean as possible
   -Initial central venous saturation is elevated which is unusual and in
   fact inconsistent with hypovolemic shock
   -Will repeat CvO2
   -Replace blood loss
   -Continue antibiotics
   2)Anemia--Secondary to blood loss
   -Transfuse to HCT=24
   -Continue drainage
   -Will need ortho to consider re-exploration threshold
   3)Chronic Renal Failure-
   -Renal consulting and considering timing of repeat dialysis
   -IVF to be used carefully

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the Ortho Service for the removal of his right hip prosthesis. He has been experiencing hypotension requiring ICU admission. The patient's prolonged hospital course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, bowel ischemia, and a suspected persistent infection localized to the hip replacement site. In the postoperative period, the patient has had significant blood loss leading to hypovolemic shock.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Shock--Hypovolemic: The patient's ongoing blood loss and low blood pressure indicate the possibility of hypovolemic shock. This will likely be difficult to stabilize due to the patient's significant blood loss and ongoing drainage from the surgical site.
2) Anemia--Secondary to blood loss: The patient's low hemoglobin levels suggest anemia secondary to blood loss. Blood transfusion may be necessary to maintain an appropriate hematocrit level.
3) Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate possible chronic renal failure. Renal consultation is recommended, and careful fluid management should be considered.
4) MSSA endocarditis: The patient's history of persistent infection at the hip replacement site raises suspicion for MSSA endocarditis. Antibiotic therapy should be continued and further evaluation is necessary.
5) Impaired skin integrity: The patient has evidence of impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of infection.
6) Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient's"

The patient has a hip infection caused by enterococcus and is being treated with vancomycin and cefepime. The patient is also experiencing bleeding from the surgical site, requiring transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and administration of desmopressin (DDAVP) for uremic bleeding. The patient's abdominal pain and dark green stools suggest a possible Clostridium difficile infection. The patient's vital signs show atrial fibrillation and hypotension. The patient's lab results indicate anemia, elevated white blood cell count, and kidney dysfunction. The patient is also at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's impaired skin integrity and acute pain need to be addressed as well. The patient's code status is full code."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He was admitted for septic left wrist washout, right hip fracture fixation, and ischemic colitis. The patient has undergone several surgeries including hemiarthroplasty of the right hip, revision surgery, hemicolectomy with ostomy, and removal of right hip hardware.

The patient is currently experiencing hypotension and ongoing bleeding from the surgical site. He has a fever and is suspected to have sepsis, possibly due to bacteremia from the right hip hardware removal. His blood culture and wound culture are pending. The patient's vital signs are unstable with a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 128/40 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on 3 liters of nasal cannula. He is also experiencing atrial fibrillation.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, high platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and abnormal liver function tests. His fibrinogen level is within normal range, but his lactic acid level is elevated.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to blood loss and"

   Assessment and Plan
   59 yo male admitted to ICU with brisk bleeding from site of hip
   surgery--in the setting of FFP and Vitamin K and DDAVP patient has had
   some meaningful decrease in drainage rate from the site.   He has
   reasonable improvement in hemodynamics with capacity to discontinue
   pressors with fluid given and decrease in blood loss rate.
   1)Blood Loss Anemia-
   -Will continue drain suction for now
   -Could have packing but would defer to surgical team
   -Reasonable to maintain INR in this range
   -HCT likely replaced to reasonable level
   2)Hypotension-Improved with stability of blood loss
   -Continue I/O even today
   -ScVO2 at 69% is fairly non-specific and clinical care for hypovolemia
   is most consistent.
   3)Endocarditis-
   -Vanco/Cefepime to continue

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male admitted to the ICU with brisk bleeding from the site of hip surgery. The patient has had some meaningful decrease in drainage rate from the site and reasonable improvement in hemodynamics with the capacity to discontinue pressors with fluid given and decrease in blood loss rate.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Blood Loss Anemia: The patient is experiencing ongoing blood loss, which can lead to anemia. This may require ongoing monitoring and management, including transfusions if necessary.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to blood loss and hypovolemia. Close monitoring of hemodynamics and fluid balance will be essential to prevent further hypotension.
3. Endocarditis: The patient is on vancomycin and cefepime, suggesting a possible concern for endocarditis. This condition should be closely monitored, and the antibiotics should be continued as prescribed.
4. Pain: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain due to the hip surgery and ongoing drainage. Adequate pain management is crucial to prevent discomfort and agitation.
5. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged bed rest, decreased mobility, and potential infection. Regular assessment and appropriate interventions should be implemented to maintain skin integrity.
6. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of infection and ongoing drainage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and amyloidosis. The patient was transferred to the ICU after undergoing right hip hardware removal. The patient experienced hypotension and bleeding from the wound site postoperatively.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension initially but is currently stable. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management will be necessary to prevent recurrence.
2. Sepsis: The patient has had multiple surgeries and is at risk for infection. The wound culture is pending, and appropriate antibiotic therapy has been initiated based on the suspected VRE infection.
3. Acute blood-loss anemia: The patient has likely developed anemia due to bleeding during surgery and coagulopathy from coumadin. Blood products will need to be transfused carefully to maintain hemoglobin concentration and avoid complications such as hypoxia.
4. CAD: The patient's bleeding complications may be exacerbated by the use of aspirin, which should be held. Close monitoring of bleeding parameters and appropriate management will be necessary.
5. Heart failure: The patient has evidence of systolic, diastolic, and right-sided heart failure. Continued optimization of heart failure management, including holding beta-blockers, will be necessary.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and amyloid lesions. He was transferred to the ICU after undergoing right hip hardware removal due to hypotension and bleeding from the wound site. The patient remains normotensive and his hematocrit (Hct) appears to be stable post-transfusion.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypotension: Resolved
   - The patient experienced hypotension post-operatively but has since stabilized.
   - A radial intra-arterial line (RIJ) was placed.

2. Sepsis:
   - The patient had sepsis following hemiarthroplasty surgery and was revised on [**1-26**].
   - A wound culture is pending from today's procedure.
   - The patient is on daptomycin and ciprofloxacin for VRE and enterobacter per ID recommendation.

3. Acute blood-loss anemia:
   - The patient likely developed acute blood-loss anemia secondary to being on aspirin and coagulopathy from coumadin.
   - Bleeding occurred at the surgical site.
   - Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is given as needed with a goal international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5.
   - Blood transfusion is given to maintain a Hct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and amyloid lesions. He was transferred to the ICU post-operatively from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after removal of right hip hardware, with hypotension and bleeding from the wound site.

The patient has a history of hip infection, which led to hemiarthroplasty on [**1-11**], revision on [**1-26**], and now removal of the hardware. He also has acute blood-loss anemia, likely due to being on aspirin and coagulopathy from Coumadin. The patient is also experiencing systolic and diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, ischemic colitis, and ESRD on HD.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 99°F, blood pressure of 92/47 mmHg on phenylephrine, pulse rate of 137 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 3L NC. Physical examination reveals a sleepy patient who is able to answer questions with significant delay but keeps falling asleep. The patient has mildly icteric sclera, dry mouth mucosa, and clear oropharynx. The neck is supple, jugular venous"

The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of asymptomatic bradycardia and ongoing orthopedic washout. The patient has no known drug allergies and has been receiving various medications including cefepime, hydromorphone (Dilaudid), and other ICU medications.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 78 bpm with a range of 67-88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 78/32 mmHg to 159/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a range of 16-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,637 mL and output of 5,060 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,423 mL. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 19 mmHg. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a non-rebreather mask, with an ABG result of pH 7.27.

Physical examination findings are not assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic responses, movement, tone, and other parameters. Laboratory results indicate elevated leukocyte count (106 K/uL) and troponin-T levels (0.27 ng/mL), with normal kidney"

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), and congestive heart failure (CHF). He underwent right hip hardware removal after experiencing hypotension and bleeding from the wound site. 

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, resolved; sepsis post hemiarthroplasty; acute blood loss anemia; AMS (altered mental status) with differential diagnosis including infection, uremia, pain, or narcotic effect; heart failure (systolic, diastolic, and right-sided); atrial fibrillation (rate controlled); recent history of ischemic colitis; and ESRD on HD.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/50 mmHg to 159/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,637 mL and output of 5,060 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 3,423 mL. The patient's blood products transfused are 700 mL.

The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab results show abnormal liver function tests, electrolyte im"
