","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), who underwent a mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and experienced an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was initially on heparin, but it was stopped due to recurrent bloody emesis and the source of the bleed was not identified through esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient received a blood transfusion overnight and has a hematocrit (Hct) level of 34.6% now. He is currently hemodynamically stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleed despite stopping heparin. There is a concern for possible dellafoises. The plan includes continuing IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gtt, transfusing to Hct >30, and maintaining active crossmatch.

2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has a troponin leak and previous NSTEMI likely due to demand ischemia. Metoprolol has been started, and further monitoring of cardiac enzymes and an echocardiogram will be obtained.

3. AVR: The patient is at risk for clot formation/stroke, although the daily risk is relatively small compared to the active GI bleed risk. INR is therapeutic at 2.2, so Coumadin has been held.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has mild hypernatremia likely"

The patient has been stabilized with a hemoglobin concentration of 29.4% after receiving a blood transfusion overnight.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. GI bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite previous intervention. The source of the bleed is still unclear, and there is concern for possible delayed bleeding. Continuing IV pantoprazole (PPI) and planning to scope tomorrow are recommended.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient has troponin leakages and evidence of NSTEMI likely due to demand ischemia. The patient's INR is 2.2, which is therapeutic, and metoprolol has been started.
3. Mechanical AVR: The patient is at risk for clot formation/stroke due to the mechanical valve. INR monitoring and holding coumadin are advised.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has mild hypernatremia likely due to free water deficit. Hydration with D5W has been given.
5. Chronic kidney disease (CKD): Baseline creatinine levels and urine output monitoring are recommended.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   On this day I examined the patient and was present for the key portions
   of the service provided.  I have reviewed Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 8085**]
s note above and
   agree with his findings and plan of care.  The following are the major
   issues:
   1.       Abnormal mentation: the pt is still acting confused, likely
   from his recent acute medical issues in the setting of dementia. We
   hope to speak with his son to assess the pt
s recent baseline.
   2.       UGI bleed: the pt has been stable without evidence of
   recurrent bleed. Right now pt on for EGD with MAC tomorrow. We
   confirm with GI and/or anethesia
   3.       Anticoagulation: INR remains elevated without coumadin, likely
   due to antibiotics. Will consult with GI to see what INR they need for
   EGD tomorrow
   4.       CAD/NSTEMI: it appears as if pt had small infarct as a result
   of blood loss and tachycardia around GI bleed.  Enzymes decreasing now
   and pt on beta blockers but will be sure GI and anesthesia are aware of
   cardiac isssues
   5.       Hematuria: traumatic foley cath insertion yesterday.  Urology
   assistance and cystocopy greatly appreciated.
   6.       Hypernatremia: improved with D5W but Na still 147.  Will

","Summary:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease and previous mechanical aortic valve replacement who presented to the ICU for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient had recurrent upper GI bleeding despite restarting heparin and underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) without finding a clear source of bleeding. The patient received a blood transfusion overnight and has a current hemoglobin concentration of 29.4 g/dL. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac ischemia due to demand ischemia. The patient's INR is therapeutic but elevated, and heparin was held due to recent bleeding. The patient also has mild hypernatremia, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and pressure ulcers. The patient's mentation is abnormal, likely due to acute medical issues and underlying dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has had recurrent bleeding despite initial management. Continued monitoring and potential endoscopic intervention may be necessary.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's troponin levels are elevated, suggesting ongoing cardiac ischemia. Monitoring for signs of worsening ischemia and optimizing cardiac support is essential.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has mild hypernatremia that needs to be addressed to prevent further complications related to electrolyte imbalance.
4. Chronic kidney disease: Monitoring renal function and adjusting medication dosages accordingly are"

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, who underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement and experienced an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The patient was transferred to the ICU after starting heparin and had recurrent bloody emesis. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed but did not reveal the source of bleeding. Heparin was stopped at 10pm, and the patient received a transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight. The patient's hemoglobin concentration decreased from 34.6% to 29.4% due to the bleeding and transfusion. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable. 

The patient's cardiac ischemia is being managed with metoprolol, and repeat EKGs will be obtained in the morning. An echocardiogram will also be performed. The patient's risk for clot formation/stroke due to mechanical aortic valve replacement is being monitored, and the INR is at 2.0. Coumadin has been held, and coagulation trends will be monitored. 

The patient has mild hypernatremia, which is likely due to a free water deficit. Hydration will be maintained, and electrolyte imbalances will be corrected. The patient has chronic kidney disease, and renal function will be monitored. 

The patient has impaired skin integrity, with pressure ulcers on the left gluteal and left lateral malleol"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and experienced an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was transferred to the ICU after the initiation of heparin and had recurrent bloody emesis despite stopping heparin. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) decreased from 34.6% to 29.4% after transfusing one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including impaired skin integrity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and a history of CAD with a recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's cardiac enzymes (troponin-T) showed a leak, but there were no new EKG changes. 

The patient also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 147 mg/dL, which is likely due to a free water deficit. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed: The patient had recurrent upper GI bleed despite stopping heparin. He continues to be at risk for further bleeding. 
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating myocardial injury. This could be due to demand ischemia caused by the bleeding while attempting to insert a foley catheter. 
3. Stroke: There is a risk of clot formation/stroke,"

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and experienced an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed after restarting heparin therapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management.

Key issues and interventions include:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite an endoscopy (EGD) not revealing a clear source. Heparin therapy was stopped due to the bleeding, but the patient experienced recurrent bloody emesis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) decreased from 34.6 to 29.4 after transfusion of one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The patient is currently hemodynamically stable. The plan includes continuing IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, transfusing to maintain Hct >30, monitoring HCT every 6 hours, and performing a follow-up EGD.

2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely due to demand ischemia, as evidenced by rising troponin levels and changes in cardiac enzymes. Due to the active GI bleed and INR of 2.2, heparin therapy was contraindicated. The patient is now on metoprolol therapy and an echo"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was admitted to the ICU after experiencing a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and initiation of heparin therapy.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Recurrent upper GI bleed: The patient had an upper GI bleed that recurred after restarting heparin therapy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) did not reveal the source of bleeding, and heparin was stopped. The patient continues to have bloody emesis, and plans are being made for a scope under general anesthesia on Friday.

2. Hypotension: The patient has episodes of hypotension, likely due to volume depletion. The patient is dry on examination, with a urine output (U/O) of 30cc/hr. Bolus lactated Ringer's (LR) will be given as needed for hypotension, and electrolytes will be rechecked in the morning. If the patient is hypernatremic, the free water deficit will be calculated and D5W will be given.

3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (RVR): The patient had an episode of RVR last night. The patient is currently on maintenance dose of amiodarone, and lopressor"

   2. Mild CHF cannot be excluded, but much of what is seen likely relates
   to
   low inspiratory volumes and vascular blurring.
   3. Right paratracheal opacity of unknown etiology. The appearance is
   somewhat more lobulated than typically seen with engorged vascular
   structures.
   If clinically indicated, recommend further evaluation, when the patient

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was transferred to the ICU after the initiation of heparin gtt and recurrence of bloody emesis.

The patient has several medical complications that need attention:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite restarting heparin gtt. An upper endoscopy (EGD) did not reveal the source of the bleed, and heparin was stopped at 10 pm with recurrent bloody emesis 4 hours later. The patient's current hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is 30.8, and there is concern for possible delayed bleeding. The plan includes continuing IV proton pump inhibitor (PPI) gtt, transfusing to maintain Hct >30, following up with HCT every 6 hours, NPO with intravenous fluids (IVF), and performing a scope under general anesthesia on Friday. An active crossmatch is also maintained due to difficult blood matching.

2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has troponin leak with increasing levels (0.18 -> 0.37 -> 0.34 -> 0.36 -> 0.41 -> 0.40), and myocardial band (MB) levels decreasing from 14 to 6. No new EKG changes were noted."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was admitted to the ICU after the initiation of heparin and recurrence of bloody emesis. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (Hct) has decreased from 34.6 to 29.4 after transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) overnight. The patient's cardiac troponin levels have increased from 0.18 to 0.37, indicating myocardial injury. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite restarting heparin. He is currently hemodynamically stable with a Hct of 30.8%. The source of the bleeding remains unclear, and there is a concern for possible delayed bleeding (delafoises). The plan includes continuing intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) infusion, transfusing to maintain Hct >30, monitoring HCT every 6 hours, keeping the patient nil per os (NPO) with intravenous fluids (IVF), and planning for an endoscopy tomorrow.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely due to demand ischemia as a result of the GI bleed. The patient's tro"

   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note above, including assessment and plan.
   HPI:
   Transfused last night with good response in Hct. Had episode of AFib
   requiring lopressor. Blood pressure was stable throughout except drops
   to 90's when IV lopressor given. Amiodarone was started this AM; had
   brief drop in BP which is now responding to fluids.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical issues, including gastrointestinal bleed, anemia, chronic renal failure, and coagulopathy. They have a history of aortic mechanical valve replacement and obstructive sleep apnea. The patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation and required treatment with medications such as lopressor and amiodarone. The patient's blood pressure was stable throughout but dropped when lopressor was given. They also had a brief drop in blood pressure after starting amiodarone. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed, and their coagulopathy increases the risk of further bleeding complications.
2. Infection: The patient is in the ICU, which increases the risk of developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Cardiac issues: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve and experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation. This increases the risk of cardiac complications such as heart failure or thromboembolism.
4. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, which can lead to complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia can worsen if there are ongoing bleeding or inadequate production of red blood cells.
6. Thrombotic events: The patient's coagulopathy and presence of a mechanical valve"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, mechanical aortic valve replacement, and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He was admitted to the ICU after the initiation of heparin and recurrence of bloody emesis. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which did not reveal the source of bleeding. Heparin was stopped due to the recurrent bleeding, and the patient is currently hemodynamically stable with a hematocrit level of 34.5.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleeding: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite previous EGD. Further investigation and intervention are required to identify and control the source of bleeding. Colonoscopy has been planned to evaluate the lower GI tract as well.
2. Hypotension: The patient experienced episodes of hypotension, likely due to volume depletion. Close monitoring and fluid resuscitation are necessary to maintain stable blood pressure.
3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient had a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of GI bleeding. Troponin levels are elevated, and there may be ongoing cardiac damage. Monitoring of cardiac enzymes and adjustment of treatment are needed.
4. Anticoagulation: The patient is at risk for clot formation/stroke due to mechanical aortic valve replacement. INR levels are therapeutic, but the use"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient was admitted to the ICU after the initiation of heparin therapy and experienced a recurrence of bloody emesis.

The patient's current assessment includes several medical complications:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite stopping heparin therapy. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed but did not reveal the source of bleeding. The plan is to perform another EGD and possibly a capsule endoscopy if the initial preparation is inadequate.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure was previously unstable, but it has now stabilized in the 120s-140s range. Anti-hypertensive medication may be reassessed pending the outcome of the scope.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has a troponin leak, with increasing levels today, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. This may be due to silent ischemia as a result of the GI bleed. The patient's INR is elevated at 2.1 while heparin therapy is on hold. An echocardiogram (echo) showed mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with low normal left ventricular systolic function, mechanical AVR with normal gradients, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid reg"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient in the ICU is being treated for multiple medical conditions including gastrointestinal bleed, non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and anemia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 76-86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/57-143/101 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 97%, and temperature within normal range. The patient is hemodynamically stable, and there is no evidence of further bleeding. An echocardiogram shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% and moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient has received an amiodarone load.

The patient's medical history includes valve replacement (aortic mechanical), impaired skin integrity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and gastrointestinal bleed. Colonoscopy is planned for further evaluation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated troponin-T levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Valve replacement: The patient has a mechanical aortic valve, which may be associated with complications such as thromboembolism, anticoagulation-related bleeding, and valve dysfunction.
2. Impaired skin integrity: The patient's obesity and immobility in the ICU could contribute to pressure ulcers or other skin integrity issues.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 88-year-old male with a medical history of coronary artery disease (CAD), mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR), and upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient was transferred to the ICU after experiencing recurrent bloody emesis despite restarting heparin therapy.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleed despite negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). The patient is currently stable with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 34.7%. Colonoscopy is not urgent, and the patient is refusing bowel prep. The plan is to maintain the patient on clear liquids and consider magnetic resonance enterography (MRI endography) to assess the small bowel. The patient will be transfused to maintain Hct >30 and will be followed up every 12 hours with a hematocrit check. An active crossmatch has been maintained due to the difficult blood match.
2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved. Vital signs should be monitored.
3. Atrial fibrillation (A-fib): The patient is on amiodarone 200mg and will continue with this medication. Lopressor will be held.
4. AVR: The patient is at risk for clot formation/stroke, although the daily risk is relatively small compared to the active GI bleed risk. The patient's International Normalized Ratio (IN"

","The patient is an 88-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and experienced an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. He was transferred to the ICU for further management.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. GI Bleed: The patient has recurrent upper GI bleeding despite a negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). His hemoglobin (Hct) level is currently at 34.7%. Colonoscopy is not urgently needed, and the patient refuses bowel prep. The plan is to maintain the patient on clear liquids and consider MRI endography to assess the small bowel. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy will be continued, and the patient will be transfused to maintain a Hct level above 30. Active crossmatching for blood products is also recommended.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has resolved. Monitoring of vital signs will continue.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (A-fib): The patient is currently on amiodarone for A-fib, and Lopressor has been held. No episodes of rapid ventricular response (RVR) were observed overnight.

4. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has elevated troponin levels, indicating myocardial injury. There is a concern for silent ischemia, especially given the patient's active GI bleed. An ECHO was performed, showing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of GI bleed, anemia, and coagulopathy. The patient underwent an EGD, which was negative. The patient's Hct has remained stable, and hemodynamics are stable as well. The patient has been receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) for stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

24-hour events include the placement of a 20-gauge line and ongoing monitoring. The patient's vital signs have been within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate between 71-90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 132/45-158/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on the ventilator but not requiring supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's physical exam is notable for a III/VI systolic murmur holosystolic radiating to the axilla. The patient's extremities show no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing. Neurologic exam reveals the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to three of five items, and has purposeful movement. 

Laboratory results show hemoglobin levels ranging from 11.3-14 g/dL, leukocyte count between 177-224 K/uL, platelet count between 170-192 K/uL, and various electrolyte im"
