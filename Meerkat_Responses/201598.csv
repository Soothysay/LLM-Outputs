   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but has bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course will treat broadly
   for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and negative
   UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - IVF to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - measure ScVO2 and consider dopamine if < 70
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - trend lactate post-fluid resuscitation
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Currently satting 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s.  Currently reporting
   inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain. Has elevated A-a
   gradient (>300).
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine 1.6 from baseline 0.9.  Likely
   prerenal in the setting of septic shock.  Will monitor creatinine
   post-resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - consider urine electrolytes and sediment if no improvement
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative.
   - r/o MI with serial cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole
   .
   FEN: IVF as above for resuscitation, NPO requiring non-rebreather,
   monitor electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   Access: Right sepsis catheter
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but has bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course will treat broadly
   for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and negative
   UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated

   - f/u sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - IVF to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - trend lactate post-fluid resuscitation
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Currently satting 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s.  Currently reporting
   inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain. Has elevated A-a
   gradient (>300).
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and have now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor creatinine
   post-resuscitation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient, a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma, presented to the ICU with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea. He was found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently being treated for septic shock, multifocal pneumonia, and respiratory distress. He has received broad-spectrum antibiotics and is receiving IV fluids to maintain hemodynamic parameters. The patient's oxygen saturation is below 90%, and he is experiencing an inability to take deep breaths due to pain. His A-a gradient is elevated (>300). The patient also has acute renal failure, which has now corrected to baseline, and isolated ST elevation that has since resolved on future EKGs. Other comorbidities include sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, and GERD. The patient is currently on several medications and is being closely monitored in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important for early detection and management.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness are risk factors for DVT."

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presented to the hospital with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, and was found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU for critical care management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's severe hemodynamic compromise indicates a likely diagnosis of septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to infection. The patient's bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension are consistent with this diagnosis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to treat resistant infections.

2. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's current oxygen saturation of 93% on 100% non-rebreather and respiratory rates in the 30s suggest respiratory distress. His elevated A-a gradient (>300) indicates impaired oxygen transfer from the lungs to the blood. Treatment involves maintaining oxygen saturation above 90% and providing pain relief to reduce splinting. If hypoxia worsens, mechanical ventilation may be necessary.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine level from 0.9 to 1.6 suggests acute renal failure, which is likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock. Close monitoring of creatinine and adjustment of medications based on renal function are recommended."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but has bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course will treat broadly
   for resistent infections.
   - vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin
   - sputum cultures
   - urine legionella
   - blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - UA negative
   - IVF to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - measure ScVO2 and consider dopamine if < 70
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - cortisol pending, if inappropriately low will perform cortisol
   stimulation and consider stress dose steroids
   - trend lactate post-fluid resuscitation
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Currently satting 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s.  Currently reporting
   inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - check A-a gradient off of ABG
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine 1.6 from baseline 0.9.  Likely
   prerenal in the setting of septic shock.  Will monitor creatinine
   post-resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine
   - renally dose medications
   - consider urine electrolytes and sediment if no improvement
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative.
   - r/o MI with serial cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole
   .
   FEN: IVF as above for resuscitation, NPO requiring non-rebreather,
   monitor electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   Access: Right sepsis catheter
   .
   Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presented with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea and was found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology.

The patient is currently being treated for several medical complications:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is likely experiencing septic shock related to known multifocal pneumonia. He has bandemia (presence of bands on a blood smear), tachycardia (high heart rate), and hypotension (low blood pressure). He was recently treated with azithromycin without improvement, so he will be treated broadly for resistant infections.

2. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient is currently saturating at 93% on 100% non-rebreather and has a respiratory rate in the 30s. He reports an inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain. Treatment includes oxygen therapy to maintain saturations >90%, checking the A-a gradient off of ABG, using small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting, and considering mechanical ventilation if progressive hypoxia occurs.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine has increased from baseline 0.9 to 1.6. This is likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock. Monitoring of creatinine post-resuscitation is advised, along with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but has bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course will treat broadly
   for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and negative
   UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - IVF to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - trend lactate post-fluid resuscitation
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Currently satting 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s.  Currently reporting
   inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain. Has elevated A-a
   gradient (>300).
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and have now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor creatinine
   post-resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative.
   - r/o MI with serial cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole
   .
   FEN: IVF as above for resuscitation, NPO overnight, will advance today,
   monitor electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   Access: Right sepsis catheter

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea and is found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is afebrile but has bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. He was recently treated with azithromycin without improvement. The patient is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics for resistant infections. He is also on medication for hypoxia, acute renal failure, isolated ST elevation, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, and GERD. The patient's condition is stable, but he requires close monitoring and ongoing treatment for his various medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience hypoxia and respiratory distress due to the underlying pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory rate is essential. If the patient's condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.

2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of developing sepsis due to the presence of bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. Close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of laboratory parameters such as white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels are crucial."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but has bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course will treat broadly
   for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and negative
   UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has elevated WBC today
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures (gram stain showing g+ve cocci and g-ve rods)
   - blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - IVF to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - CXR to evaluate effusion, if persistent, consider thoracentesis
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: Currently satting 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s.  Currently reporting
   inability to take deep breaths secondary to pain. Has elevated A-a
   gradient (>300).
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and have now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor creatinine
   post-resuscitation.
   - monitor creatinine
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole
   .
   FEN: IVF as needed for resuscitation, regular diet, monitor
   electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI
   .
   Access: Right sepsis catheter

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presented with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU due to septic shock, likely related to known multifocal pneumonia. He is being treated with vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient also has hypoxia/respiratory distress, acute renal failure, isolated ST elevation, sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, and GERD. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient is already in the ICU due to septic shock, which is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty in taking deep breaths due to pain, with a reported inability to take deep breaths. This can lead to further respiratory distress and may require mechanical ventilation.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated from 0.9 to 1.6, indicating acute renal failure. It has now corrected to baseline, but continued monitoring is necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sarcoidosis, and recent admission for septicemia and multifocal pneumonia. He was previously on pressors but has now been weaned off. The patient is currently receiving 60% fraction of inspired oxygen (FM) and is supported with high flow nasal cannula.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate of 97 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 124/59 mmHg to 135/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, central venous pressure (CVP) is 5 mmHg, and he has received a total of 2,055 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 1,950 mL.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 117 on 60% FM, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's blood cultures were drawn on 05/15/2018 at 06:16 PM and 06:28 PM, and he received vancomycin on 05/15/2018 at 08:05 PM. He also received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/17/2018 at 01:57 AM.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 10.4 on 05/15/2018 and 12.1 on 05/16/2018, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 35.6 on 05/15/2018 and 32.6 on 05/17/2018, platelet (Plt) count of 156 on 05/15/2018 and 152 on 05/17/2018, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.9 on 05/15/2018 and 05/17/2018, troponin T level of <0.01 on both dates, and blood glucose level of 95 on 05/15/2018 and 142 on 05/16/2018.

The patient's assessment and plan include severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP)/hypoxemia/respiratory distress, for which he will continue receiving vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin. The patient is also being monitored for septic shock, as he has been off pressors. Additionally, there is a mention of a pleural effusion, which may require tapping if significant. The patient is also on morphine for pleuritic pain.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and further deterioration in respiratory function."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but had bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin previously in [**Month (only) **].  Given his
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course, we are treating
   broadly for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and
   negative UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has slightly elevated WBC
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures, appears to be oral flora (gram stain showing
   g+ve cocci and g-ve rods)
   - f/u blood cultures pending from emergency room
   - IVF as needed to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: O2 saturations of 93% - 100% with
   respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 60% and have been unable to
   wean, however is now on face tent so probably receiving a lower amount
   of oxygen than on admission. Reports inability to take deep breaths
   secondary to pain.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and has now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole
   .
   FEN: IVF as needed for resuscitation, regular diet, monitor
   electrolytes
   .
   Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin, PPI

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but had bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin without improvement.  Given severe
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course treating broadly
   for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and negative
   UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has slightly elevated WBC
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures (gram stain showing g+ve cocci and g-ve rods)
   - f/u blood cultures pending from emergnecy room
   - IVF as needed to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   - CXR to evaluate effusion, if persistent, consider thoracentesis
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: O2 saturations of 93% on 100%
   non-rebreather with respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 60% and
   have been unable to wean. Reports inability to take deep breaths
   secondary to pain.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and has now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea and has been diagnosed with multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology.

The patient is currently experiencing septic shock, likely related to his known multifocal pneumonia. He is afebrile but has bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. Despite being treated with azithromycin without improvement, he has severe hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic treatment for resistant infections. His urine Legionella and urinalysis results are negative. Cortisol levels are appropriately elevated, and his white blood cell count is slightly elevated.

The patient is being treated with vancomycin, zosyn, and levofloxacin. He is also receiving IV fluids to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, and UOP > 30cc/hr, as well as levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters. A chest X-ray has been ordered to evaluate for effusion, and if persistent, a thoracentesis may be considered.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxia and respiratory distress, with O2 saturations of 93% on 100% non-rebreather. He has been unable to wean from respiratory support and reports inability to take deep breaths due to pain. His pneumonia is being treated similarly"

The patient is currently being treated for septic shock, likely related to known multifocal pneumonia. He is afebrile but has bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. He was recently treated with azithromycin without improvement, so broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered.

The patient is also being treated for hypoxia/respiratory distress, acute renal failure, isolated ST elevation (which has since resolved), sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening septic shock, progression of pneumonia, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential complications related to the patient's underlying conditions such as sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical response to treatment. Timely intervention and adjustment of the treatment plan may be necessary to prevent or manage potential complications."

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, hypotension, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient has been receiving antibiotics, pain medication, and other ICU medications. His vital signs are stable, but he has tachypnea and tachycardia. Physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side and dullness to percussion on the right side, suggesting a possible pleural effusion. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging studies are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pleural effusion: The patient's physical examination findings suggest the presence of a pleural effusion. If the effusion is large enough, it may need to be drained to prevent complications such as respiratory distress or infection.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, which can progress and lead to complications such as respiratory failure, abscess formation, or dissemination of infection.
3. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is a risk of deterioration and development of septic shock if the infection is not adequately controlled.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, indicating hypotension. This can increase the risk of organ perfusion issues and potential organ damage if not managed appropriately.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired (CAP). The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypotension (not in shock), pain control (acute and chronic pain), and pneumonia. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 144/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 35 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is receiving high-flow oxygen via a face tent and has been placed on respiratory support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and he is receiving respiratory support. This indicates potential respiratory failure, which could be due to the underlying pneumonia or complications related to mechanical ventilation.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction. If left untreated, sepsis can progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower end of the normal range. If the hypotension persists or worsens, it may indicate a decline in the patient's overall condition and could potentially lead to septic shock.
4. Pneumonia complications: The patient's pneumonia could lead to complications such as pleural effusion,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with severe COPD who presented with respiratory distress. He is currently in the ICU and requires high levels of oxygen. The patient's condition has improved slightly today. He has a history of multiple medical conditions and is on various medications. His vital signs are relatively stable, but he still experiences some pain with deep breathing. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and hypotension. He is receiving appropriate antibiotics and pain management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current diagnosis is bacterial pneumonia. If not properly treated, there is a risk of worsening infection and potentially developing complications such as abscess formation or pleural effusion.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, there is still a risk of progression to septic shock if the infection spreads and affects vital organs.
3. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure can be a sign of inadequate tissue perfusion. If not managed appropriately, it may lead to organ dysfunction or failure.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU can increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs. These clots can potentially dislodge and cause a pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition.
5. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's need for respiratory support"

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but had bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin previously in [**Month (only) **].  Given his
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course, we are treating
   broadly for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and
   negative UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has slightly elevated WBC
   - Vancomycin and zosyn switched to ceftriaxone per ID, continue
   ceftriaxone and levaquin
   - sputum cultures show sparse oral flora (gram stain showing g+ve cocci
   and g-ve rods)
   - BCx no growth to date
   - IVF as needed to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: O2 saturations of 93% - 100% with
   respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 40% on face tent plus 3 L NC.
   Respiratory status improving.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and has now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam
   .
   Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy:
   - continue finasteride
   .
   Exercise Induced Asthma:
   - continue albuterol, advair and monteleukast
   .
   GERD:
   - continue omeprazole

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including azithromycin, vancomycin, zosyn, and ceftriaxone. His vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxia. He has slightly elevated WBC count and elevated creatinine levels but has now corrected to baseline. The patient's EKG showed isolated ST elevation on admission but subsequently resolved. His sarcoidosis is manifested by pulmonary and ocular complications. The patient has multiple comorbidities including obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, GERD, and FEN.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient's O2 saturations are currently between 93% and 100% with respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 40% on face tent plus 3 L NC. This indicates respiratory distress, and there is a potential for further deterioration, which may require mechanical ventilation.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated to 1.6 from baseline 0.9 but have now corrected to baseline. Continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure renal function does not deteriorate again.

3. Isolated ST Elevation: Although the ST elevation resolved on future EKGs, the initial finding suggests the possibility of an acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac enzymes were negative, ruling out myocardial infarction (MI), but close monitoring is required to detect any changes indicative of cardiac ischemia.

4. Sarcoidosis: The patient's sarcoidosis can manifest with pulmonary and ocular complications. Monitoring for these complications and managing them accordingly is crucial.

5. Septic Shock: Given the patient's bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension, there is a risk of septic shock. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and appropriate management of infections are essential to prevent further deterioration.

6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels need to be closely monitored, and insulin sliding scale should be administered as needed to maintain glycemic control.

7. Other comorbidities: The patient has several comorbidities that require ongoing management, including obstructive sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, GERD, and FEN."

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but had bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin previously in [**Month (only) **].  Given his
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course, we are treating
   broadly for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and
   negative UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has slightly elevated WBC
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures, appears to be oral flora (gram stain showing
   g+ve cocci and g-ve rods)
   - f/u blood cultures pending from emergency room
   - IVF as needed to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: O2 saturations of 93% - 100% with
   respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 60% and have been unable to
   wean, however is now on face tent so probably receiving a lower amount
   of oxygen than on admission. Reports inability to take deep breaths
   secondary to pain.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and has now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, and has been diagnosed with multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires ongoing care and monitoring.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Septic Shock: The patient is already showing signs of septic shock, which is a severe response to infection characterized by low blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and low urine output. It is important to continue aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability.

2. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing due to pain and has been unable to be weaned off ventilatory support. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation levels and respiratory rates is essential. If the patient's condition worsens, mechanical ventilation may be required.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have increased from baseline, indicating possible acute renal failure. This could be due to prerenal causes associated with septic shock. Regular monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration.

4. Isolated ST Elevation: The patient initially had ST elevation in lead III on admission, which subsequently resolved. This may suggest a transient ischemic event or non-cardiac causes. However"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, and was found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for septic shock, likely related to the known multifocal pneumonia. He has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics due to hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic use. His vital signs are stable, but he is experiencing hypoxia and respiratory distress, which has not improved despite receiving high-flow oxygen. He is also experiencing acute renal failure, but his creatinine levels have now returned to baseline. Other conditions such as isolated ST elevation, sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, depression, benign prostatic hypertrophy, exercise-induced asthma, and GERD are also being monitored and managed accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's inability to wean off mechanical ventilation and prolonged exposure to endotracheal tubes increase the risk of developing VAP.
2. Nosocomial infections: Prolonged hospital stay and invasive procedures increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and respiratory distress could"

   Assessment and Plan
 Mr. [**Known lastname 5876**] is a 56 year old male with a history of pulmonary
   sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea and asthma who presents from home
   with right sided chest pain and dyspnea found to have a multifocal
   right sided pneumonia and septic physiology.
   .
   Septic Shock: Likely related to known multifocal pneumonia.  Patient is
   afebrile, but had bandemia, tachycardia and hypotension.  He was
   recently treated with azithromycin previously in [**Month (only) **].  Given his
   hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course, we are treating
   broadly for resistent infections. Has negative urine Legionella and
   negative UA. Cortisol appropriately elevated. Has slightly elevated WBC
   - cont vancomycin, zosyn and levofloxaxin for now
   - f/u sputum cultures, appears to be oral flora (gram stain showing
   g+ve cocci and g-ve rods)
   - f/u blood cultures pending from emergency room
   - IVF as needed to target CVP 10-12, MAP > 65, UOP > 30cc/hr
   - levophed as necessary to maintain hemodynamic parameters
   .
   Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: O2 saturations of 93% - 100% with
   respiratory rates in the 30s on FiO2 of 60% and have been unable to
   wean, however is now on face tent so probably receiving a lower amount
   of oxygen than on admission. Reports inability to take deep breaths
   secondary to pain.
   - treating pneumonia as above
   - oxygen to maintain saturations > 90%
   - small doses of morphine to allow for decreased splinting
   - if progressive hypoxia will require mechanical ventilation
   - continue home asthma regimen
   .
   Acute Renal Failure:  Creatinine was elevated to 1.6 from baseline
   0.9.  Likely prerenal in the setting of septic shock and has now
   corrected to baseline.  Will continue to monitor.
   .
   Isolted ST elevation:  Patient with [**Street Address(2) 5877**] elevation in lead
   III on admission.  Subsequently resolved on future EKGs.  One set of
   cardiac enzymes negative. Ruled out for MI with cardiac enzymes
   .
   Sarcoidosis:  Manifested by pulmonary and occular complications.  Nto
   on recent steroids.  Appearance of chest CT does not suggest severe
   disease.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   Obstructive Sleep Apnea:
   - continue home CPAP if tolerated
   .
   Hyperglycemia:  Not on medications at home.
   - insulin sliding scale
   .
   Hypercholesterolemia
   - continue cholestyramine
   .
   Depression:
   - continue effexor and clonazepam

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. He presents with right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, and was found to have multifocal right-sided pneumonia and septic physiology. The patient is currently in the ICU for ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with bandemia, tachycardia, and hypotension, which are indicative of septic shock. This condition is likely related to his known multifocal pneumonia. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics due to his hemodynamic compromise and recent antibiotic course.
2. Hypoxia/Respiratory Distress: The patient has been unable to wean off the ventilator and requires supplemental oxygen. His oxygen saturations range from 93% to 100%. He reports difficulty taking deep breaths secondary to pain.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated from 0.9 to 1.6, but have now corrected to baseline. This could be due to prerenal causes secondary to septic shock. Renal function will continue to be monitored.
4. Isolated ST Elevation: The patient had transient ST elevation in lead III on admission, which has since resolved. Cardiac enzymes are negative, ruling out myocardial infarction.
5. Sarcoidosis: The patient's sarcoid"

","Summary:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He has shown improvement overnight and is currently stable in the ICU. The patient has a history of aspirin allergy, abdominal pain, prednisone use, glaucoma, and several other medical conditions. He is receiving multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and ceftriaxone. Other medications include morphine sulfate, heparin sodium, and various other medications for different conditions. The patient's review of systems is mostly negative, except for chest pain that has improved, headache, and anemia. Physical examination findings include crackles in the bilateral lower lung fields, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin. Vital signs are generally within normal ranges, although the patient's respiratory rate is elevated. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid balance. The patient is on respiratory support with a nasal cannula and has good oxygenation. Lab results show normal white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. Electrolytes are within normal limits. The patient is alert and oriented, but movement and muscle tone assessments were not performed. The patient's condition has improved significantly, with resolution of acute respiratory failure (ARF) and septic shock."
