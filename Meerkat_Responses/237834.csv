","Summary:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation. She presents with BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood per rectal examination) and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, which is concerning for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB). Other potential causes of GI bleed include diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), and bowel ischemia. The patient also has a history of prolapse repair and normal colonoscopy in 2014 per primary care physician (PCP). In the emergency department, she received 1 liter of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), resulting in an increase in systolic blood pressure from 85 to 105. 

The patient is currently being actively transfused with 2 PRBCs, with plans to continue the transfusion. Her hemoglobin concentration will be checked every 4 hours, and she will receive transfusions for hemoglobin levels less than 27. Intravenous fluids (IVF) will be administered for hypotension and to maintain mean arterial pressures (MAPs) above 60. Invasive monitoring, including an arterial line (a-line) and central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring, will be established. A gastrointestinal consult has been requested for a colonoscopy in the morning with preparation today. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy has been initiated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, admitted to the ICU due to GI bleed. She received blood transfusions and had bowel preparation for a planned colonoscopy. Her hemoglobin levels seem stable, but she remains pale, and there is ongoing blood from the rectal tube. The patient has tachycardia and a heart murmur, and an irregular rhythm strip was ordered. Other concerns include pneumothorax, history of pelvic fracture, hypertension, potential seizure disorder, and fasting status. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Anemia (GI bleed): The patient's hemoglobin levels may continue to decrease due to ongoing blood loss from the GI bleed, which can lead to worsening anemia.
2. Tachycardia (irregular)/heart murmur: The irregular heart rhythm and heart murmur could indicate underlying cardiac issues, such as arrhythmias or structural heart disease. Further evaluation with EKG and echocardiogram is necessary.
3. Pneumothorax: The patient's respiratory support and ABG results should be closely monitored for any signs of pneumothorax, which could compromise respiratory function.
4. History of pelvic fracture: The patient's past medical history of pelvic fracture should be considered, as it may contribute to her current condition or increase the risk of complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 89-year-old female with a history of CVA, rectal prolapse, and constipation. She was admitted with BRBPR (blood-tinged red blood per rectum) and a drop in hemoglobin concentration, suggesting a lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB). Other possible causes of the bleed include diverticulosis, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), or bowel ischemia. The patient also reported melena, which can indicate an upper gastrointestinal bleed (UGIB).

The patient received 1 liter of normal saline and 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) in the emergency department, resulting in an increase in systolic blood pressure from 85 to 105. The medical team has recommended a tagged red cell scan to further investigate the source of the bleeding, along with holding off on colonoscopy at this time. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) level should be monitored every four hours, and transfusion should be considered if the Hct falls below 30. Intravenous fluids (IVF) will be administered for hypotension to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60, and additional large-bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are needed.

The patient has been diagnosed with multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), possibly due to a pneumothorax that occurred after line placement. Telemetry monitoring will continue, and a"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient in the ICU has been stable with no active bleeding, but there are several ongoing medical complications. The patient's hematocrit remains stable, indicating that the anemia from the GI bleed is not worsening. However, the patient still has a line-related pneumothorax that has not changed with oxygen therapy. 

The patient's heart rate improved after receiving blood, fluids, and a low-dose beta blocker. An ECHO revealed moderate-severe mitral regurgitation (MR) consistent with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). 

The patient also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), as evidenced by dysuria and the need to discontinue the foley catheter. Antibiotics were started, and the patient's vital signs are relatively stable. 

Additionally, the patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently receiving dilantin and Keppra. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pneumothorax: The patient has an unchanged line-related pneumothorax. Placement of a small chest tube for drainage may be necessary to manage this complication.
2. Mitral regurgitation/outflow obstruction: The patient's tachycardia improved with fluids/blood/low-dose beta blocker, but further management is needed due to moderate-severe MR consistent with HOCM. Cardiology consult is recommended.
3. UTI: Discontinuation of the foley catheter and appropriate antibiotic"
