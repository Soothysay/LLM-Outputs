The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), type II diabetes mellitus, gout, and previous stroke. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, hypotension, pneumonia, and renal failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 101/52 to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient is receiving insulin via continuous infusion to control persistent hyperglycemia, which has not responded to IV insulin boluses. His glucose levels have been ranging from 72 to 280 mg/dL. The patient is also receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube with Nutren 2.0 at 50 mL/hour.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) levels, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels, slightly elevated platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, elevated troponin-T levels, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests.

The patient's medical complications include fever, hypotension, altered mental status, pneumonia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and ventricular tachycardia. The plan includes close monitoring of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU and received various interventions including the placement of a PICC line, EKG, insulin infusion for persistent hyperglycemia, and planned hemodialysis.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/54 to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a tracheostomy mask. The patient is on respiratory support with supplemental oxygen.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, and elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as glucose, potassium, sodium, and liver enzymes are also noted.

The patient's assessment and plan include fever, hypotension, altered mental status, pneumonia, renal failure, hypernatremia, ventricular tachycardia, anemia, chronic kidney disease, history of stroke, gout, and type II diabetes mellitus.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include sepsis secondary to pneumonia, worsening renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and further episodes of ventricular tachycardia. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of deterioration and adjust treatment accordingly."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old male with an altered mental status. The patient has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), type II diabetes mellitus (DM), gout, and a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarct. The patient was admitted to the ICU for fever, hypotension, pneumonia, renal failure, hypernatremia, and ventricular tachycardia.

24-hour events include the placement of a PICC line, EKG, and initiation of various treatments such as insulin gtt for persistent glucose levels around 360, and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 96 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/54 mmHg to 123/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals trace right radial pulse, warm and well-perfused extremities with 1+ non-pitting edema, distended abdomen that flinches to palpation at the right lower quadrant, and limited mouth exam suggestive of mouth mucosal mucositis and oral pseudomembranous candidiasis.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN"

 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN);
   PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   Fever is resolving in the face of new antibiotics. Likely the result of
   pneumonia, covering for pseudomonas and hospital organisms given trach
   and hospital stay. Following cultures, no new data this am.
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   With resolution of fever also appears to be resolving. Fluid
   responsive. Course consistent with peri-sepsis/SIRS, now resolving with
   antibiotics. Follow, give fluid boluses as needed. If he has
   hypotension in the absence of infectious symptoms would then expand
   differential, consider echo, etc.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   Semi responsive today. Likely near baseline per past neuro recs. Will
   continue to follow and assess. [**Month (only) 60**] improve with treatment of infection
   if this is not purely the result of stroke.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues. Here is a summary of the patient's health progress:

- The patient has an altered mental status, described as semi-responsive. This could be related to an underlying infection, stroke, or other factors.
- The patient is febrile, with a fever that appears to be resolving after starting new antibiotics. It is likely due to pneumonia, possibly caused by pseudomonas or hospital organisms.
- Hypotension has been observed but seems to be resolving with the treatment of the infection. The patient is considered fluid responsive and does not show signs of septic shock.
- The patient has renal failure, requiring dialysis. They have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and will need ongoing renal support.
- There have been episodes of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and it is important to maintain potassium levels above 4 to prevent further cardiac arrhythmias.
- The patient has chronic anemia and may require transfusion if their hematocrit level falls below 21.
- The patient has a history of stroke (left MCA infarct) and gout.
- They also have type II diabetes mellitus, and their insulin regimen will need to be adjusted based on their glycemic control. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the altered mental status, development of new infections, worsening renal function, cardiac arrhythmias, and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male who is currently unresponsive and in the ICU due to severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2), suspected sepsis physiology, renal failure (ESRD), altered mental status, pneumonia, type II diabetes mellitus, previous ischemic stroke, chronic anemia, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The patient is receiving various medications, including antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), nutrition through enteral feeding (Nutren 2.0), and insulin gtt for diabetes management. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 119/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on tracheal mask ventilation. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 1,483 mL over the past 24 hours. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's medical history includes severe aortic stenosis, diabetes mellitus type II, ischemic stroke, chronic kidney disease, and chronic anemia. The patient's current condition is complicated by hypotension, fever, pneumonia, renal failure, altered mental status, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 45-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including severe aortic stenosis, diabetes mellitus type II, history of stroke (left MCA infarct), chronic anemia, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

From the note, it appears that the patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) without experiencing hypotension during the procedure. However, on the floor, the patient's blood pressure dropped to 81 mmHg, which responded to a 250 cc normal saline (NS) bolus.

The patient has a low-grade temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, for which Tylenol was given. Chest X-ray showed no change from the previous one. The patient's bed will be available at Hospital1 on Thursday as per case management.

The patient is unable to provide his medical history due to encephalopathy and unresponsiveness. Allergies are noted to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/20/2181 at 07:00 PM and Piperacillin on 02/22/2181 at 05:37 AM.

The patient is currently on various infusions and medications in the ICU, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventil"

   physiology
   Mr [**Known lastname 165**]
s AS makes him extremely preload dependent and fluid shifts
   post-dialysis may have greater effects on his blood pressure than they
   would for others. He responded well to a single small bolus. He is
   likely to continue to have transient episodes of hypotension because of
   his need for dialysis and his AS.
 FEVER (HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA, NOT FEVER OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN)
   Still treating with vanco/zosyn. Fevers may be result of medications.
   Adding on diff to check for eosinophilia. Not clear where or with what
   he might be infected that could cause him continuing fevers; could be
   organism incompletely treated with vanco/zosyn; probably more likely
   non-infectious cause. Follow closely.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of severe aortic stenosis (valve area 0.8 cm2), type II diabetes mellitus, previous stroke (left MCA infarct), chronic anemia, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The patient is currently unresponsive and in the ICU due to encephalopathy.

24-hour events:
- The patient underwent hemodialysis (HD) with removal of 3.2 liters. He did not experience hypotension during HD but had a blood pressure reading of 81 at 1:30 AM on the floor. A 250 cc normal saline bolus was given and his blood pressure responded well.
- The patient has a low-grade temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, for which Tylenol was administered.
- Chest X-ray showed no change from previous findings.
- The patient will be transferred to Hospital 1 on Thursday as per case management.

Medical History:
The patient is unable to provide his medical history due to encephalopathy, so information was obtained from medical records.

Allergies:
The patient is allergic to Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) and Piperacillin.

Infusions and Medications:
The patient is receiving various medications, including Tylenol, antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), and other ICU medications. He is also being given Nutren 2.0 ("

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple comorbidities, including respiratory failure, altered mental status, history of stroke, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic anemia, and previous pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been in the ICU for an extended period.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension last night, which may be related to fluid removal during dialysis. The patient responded well to a single fluid bolus.

2. Fever: The patient had a high temperature yesterday but showed a decrease in white blood cell count this morning. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the fever.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's serum sodium levels are elevated today, indicating hypernatremia. Additional free water will be required to address this issue.

4. Pneumonia: Although no clear infiltrate is currently present on the chest X-ray, the patient has a history of pneumonia and ongoing respiratory symptoms. Sputum for gram stain and culture should be resent.

5. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): The patient has end-stage renal disease and requires regular dialysis. The patient tolerated yesterday's dialysis session without complications.

6. Ventricular Tachycardia: The patient has a history of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, and efforts should be made to keep potassium levels above 4.0 mEq"
