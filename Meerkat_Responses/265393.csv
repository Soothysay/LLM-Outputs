","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hypertension, BPH, and hyperlipidemia who was admitted for further management of cholangitis. He underwent ERCP and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, where pus in the gallbladder spilled into the abdomen. The patient was sedated and appeared to have obstructive apnea, so he was given Narcan and placed on BiPAP. His mental status improved, but he pulled out his foley catheter, reporting difficulty voiding due to a history of BPH. A urology consult was ordered, and the surgical resident will order a culture data call in the morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cholangitis: The patient's condition of cholangitis may lead to complications such as sepsis or worsening liver function.
2. Infection: The presence of pus in the gallbladder and potential spillage into the abdomen increases the risk of infection, which can progress to sepsis.
3. Respiratory issues: The patient's sedation and appearance of obstructive apnea may indicate respiratory problems, which could worsen if not properly managed.
4. Voiding difficulties: The patient's history of BPH and removal of the gallbladder may contribute to voiding difficulties, potentially leading to urinary retention or infection.
5. Bleeding: Surgical procedures, such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy, carry a risk of bleeding, especially if there were any complications during the surgery.
6. Thromboembolic events: Prolonged immobilization and the presence of infection increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. He presented to the emergency department and was admitted to the ICU due to his unstable condition. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and laparoscopic cholecystectomy, where pus was found in the gallbladder. He was heavily sedated and had difficulty breathing, requiring assistance with airway protection. The patient also pulled out his Foley catheter, leading to difficulty voiding, and a urology consult was ordered. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, heart rate of 97 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. His ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 356, indicating respiratory acidosis with hypoxemia. The patient is receiving IV fluids, antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic heparin. His laboratory results indicate elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and abnormal electrolyte levels (potassium, phosphorus, and calcium). The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's history of obstructive apnea, respiratory acidosis, and hypoxemia suggest the possibility of respiratory complications. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary. The use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or intubation may be required if his respiratory function deteriorates.

2. Infection: The presence of pus in the gallbladder and elevated white blood cell count raise concerns about potential infection. Cultures have been ordered, and appropriate antibiotics have been administered. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and regular assessment of vital signs are essential.

3. Hepatic Dysfunction: The elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) indicate possible hepatic dysfunction. Further evaluation of liver function and monitoring for signs of liver failure are necessary.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The abnormal electrolyte levels (potassium, phosphorus, and calcium) need close attention. Regular monitoring of electrolytes and correction of imbalances are crucial to prevent complications such as cardiac arrhythmias or muscle weakness.

5. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's history of urinary retention and difficulty voiding may lead to renal dysfunction. Frequent assessment of urine output and monitoring of renal function are necessary.

6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and surgery increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures, such as heparin, have been initiated. Regular surveillance for signs of DVT is essential.

7. Delirium: Postoperative delirium can occur in elderly patients undergoing major surgery. Continuous assessment of mental status and prompt intervention"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperlipidemia. He presented to the hospital for further management of cholangitis. 

On [**2178-8-6**] at 11:00 AM, the patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which revealed a stone and significant pus in the gallbladder. The patient also had a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, where the inflamed gallbladder was removed. A stent was placed during the procedure. The patient received 100cc of blood products and 1200cc of intravenous fluids (IVF).

During the post-operative period, the patient was heavily sedated and appeared to be experiencing obstructive apnea. He was given 0.2mg of Narcan and placed on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient's arterial blood gases (ABGs) were followed, and he was weaned to nasal cannula oxygen (NC) 2L in the morning. His sats were in the mid-90s, and his mental status improved. 

In the evening, the patient pulled out his Foley catheter, which had no water in the balloon, but reported difficulty voiding due to a history of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, BPH, and hyperlipidemia. He was admitted for further management of cholangitis and underwent an ERCP procedure, which revealed a stone and significant amount of pus in the gallbladder. A cholecystectomy was performed, and a stent was placed.

The patient's current condition includes difficulty voiding due to a traumatic foley insertion, possible EtOH history with ongoing CIWA protocol, sleep apnea with improving mental status, and hypertension that is being held due to cholangitis. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The presence of pus in the gallbladder indicates an infection, which may lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Bile leak: After cholecystectomy, there is a risk of bile leakage, especially if the stent becomes blocked or dislodged.
3. Hepatic complications: If the biliary obstruction persists, it can cause hepatic complications such as jaundice or liver failure.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea and hypercarbic respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed.
5. Renal dysfunction: The use of nephrotoxic drugs or the development of acute kidney injury due to dehydration or sepsis could lead to renal dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and chronic ethanol use. He presented with cholangitis and cholecystitis. 

The patient underwent an ERCP with stent placement and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lap chole) with drainage of pus in the gallbladder and abdomen. Postoperatively, he was extubated but remained very sedated upon arrival to the ICU.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/71 to 136/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula with supplemental oxygen. 

The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.30, PaCO2 of 56 mmHg, PaO2 of 178 mmHg, and HCO3- of 25 mEq/L. His respiratory support includes bipap ventilation with improvement in mental status.

Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, crackles in both lung bases, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no peripheral edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of OSA, hypertension, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. He presents with cholangitis post-ERCP with stent and cholecystitis post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various procedures, including ERCP, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and placement of a drain due to pus in the abdomen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypercarbic respiratory failure, which may require further intervention such as mechanical ventilation.
2. Infection: The presence of pus in the abdomen suggests a possible infection, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications.
3. ETOH withdrawal: Considering the patient's history of ethanol use, monitoring for signs of withdrawal is essential.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized, there is an increased risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis with subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin should be initiated.
5. Stress ulcers: Due to the patient's critical condition, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker is recommended to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to minimize this risk.
7. Liver dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes ("

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperlipidemia. He presents to the ICU with cholangitis and was initially managed in the hospital ward. The patient underwent an ERCP procedure and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with gallbladder and abdominal drain placement. He was extubated in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) but remained very sedated with hypercarbic respiratory failure. Bipap was initiated with improvement in mental status. The patient self-disconnected from the Foley catheter. There are no known drug allergies. The patient received a last dose of antibiotics, Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn), on 08/06/2178 at 04:06 PM. He has been receiving various medications including hydromorphone (Dilaudid), naloxone (Narcan), famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Review of systems and medical history remain unchanged except for the noted events above. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/71 to 136/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is on standby ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 700 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 13 cmH2O. Arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.30, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 356, oxygen consumption (VO2) of 12.2 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 356. The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds with crackles bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds present, and no peripheral edema. Neurologic examination is not assessed. Laboratory values show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), low hemoglobin (Hct), slightly elevated platelet count (Plt), elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated alkaline phosphatase (Alk Phos), and elevated total bilirubin (T Bili). Other lab results are within normal ranges. Imaging and microbiology data are pending. The patient's assessment includes ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines, prophylaxis, and VAP. The plan is to continue ICU care and transfer the patient to the surgical service floor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old male with a history of OSA, htn, bph, and chronic etoh use. He presented with cholangitis and cholecystitis, following an ERCP with stent placement and subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The patient was extubated in the PACU but remained very sedated upon arrival to the ICU. He had hypercarbic respiratory failure and was placed on BiPAP with improvement. The patient self-disconnected from the BiPAP and the team was unable to replace it. He received a Foley catheter but was unable to retain it. The patient has been receiving antibiotics for cholangitis/cholecystitis and is expected to complete the course. His liver function tests are decreasing, but there is still a concern for post-ERCP pancreatitis. The patient tolerated BiPAP well overnight and is now breathing better. However, he would benefit from a formal outpatient sleep evaluation. He has a history of chronic etoh use but denies prior withdrawal. The patient will be monitored for signs of withdrawal and will continue to receive prophylaxis with H2 blocker, sq hep, and PIVs. Code status is full code. The patient is stable for transfer to the surgical service later this morning.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Early sepsis: The patient has mild RUQ tenderness and fever, which could indicate ongoing infection and the possibility of early sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with past medical history of
   hypertension, BPH, and hyperlipidemia who presents from [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
   further management of cholangitis.
   .
   #) Cholangitis: Status-post ERCP which revealed a stone and significant
   amount of pus and cholecystectomy. Stent was placed at that time.
   - Continue antibiotics with vanc/zosyn
   - Follow up cultures
   - Low dose dilaudid for pain control
   - f/u amylase/lipase and LFTs
   .
   #) Traumatic foley: 300c PVR with difficulty with foley insertion;
   inserted by urology
   - continue restraints
   #) Sleep apnea: pt. has never received a sleep study; no CPAP use at
   home.  Still in hypercarbic respiratory failure with improving mental
   status currently.
   - recheck ABG
   - Consider sleep study on outpt. basis
   - may require auto CPAP when transferred to floor
   .
   #) EtOH history: illicit more in depth history in terms of prior
   withdrawal symptoms -> consumes 3-5 beers per day, and has stopped
   drinking before without issue
   - continue with CIWA protocol
   .
   #) Hypertension: Monitor BP. Consider antihypertensives if BP remains
   elevated.
   .
   #) Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin for now till LFTs trend down.
   .
   #)FEN:
   - IVF as needed to support BP or if becomes tachycardic, otherwise will
   keep on some maintenance fluids
   - f/u I+Os with bladder scans before foley placement
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Diet: Clear liquids
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin.
   #) Access: peripherals
   .
   #) Code:  Full (discussed with patient)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperlipidemia. He presents to the ICU for further management of cholangitis. 

The patient has had several significant events since admission. On [**2178-8-7**], a balloon in the prostate was found inflated during a Foley insertion, which required reinsertion of the Foley catheter. Additionally, the patient developed a fever of 103.1°F and was shivering, with blood pressure in the 110s-130s, tachycardia to 120s-130s, and respiratory rate of 19-39 breaths per minute. The patient's oxygen saturation was 94% on a nasal cannula, and arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis showed respiratory alkalosis with a PaO2 of 45. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, which showed no pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has also had multiple episodes of removing the Foley catheter, with the most recent occurrence at 1 am, prompting a call to urology for reinsertion. The patient's urinary output has been monitored, with a total output of 1,970 mL since admission. 

Regarding the patient's vital signs, his temperature has fluctuated between 37°C and 39.5°C, his blood"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with past medical history of
   hypertension, BPH, and hyperlipidemia who presents from [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
   further management of cholangitis.
   .
   #) Cholangitis: Status-post ERCP which revealed a stone and significant
   amount of pus and cholecystectomy. Stent was placed at that time.
   - Continue borad coverage with vanc/zosyn for now
   - Follow up cultures on [**8-7**] and consider going back to Unasyn alone if
   no growth
   - unfortunately no old culture data here or from OSH
   - continue dilaudid for pain control
   - continue monitoring LFTs which are still elev, but trending down
   (except T bili is slightly up)
   #) Fever: diff incl post-surgical infection (exam nl), bacteremia, UTI
   (UA neg), PNA (CXR neg), gastroenteritis (no diarrhea)
   - f/u cultures
   - continue broad coverage with vanc/zosyn for now
   #) Traumatic foley: reinserted by Urology
   - continue restraints
   - monitor UOP
   #) Sleep apnea: pt. has never received a sleep study; no CPAP use at
   home.
   - Plan for sleep study on outpt. basis
   - Encourage  auto CPAP when in hospital (pt is refusing)
   .
   #) EtOH history: illicit more in depth history in terms of prior
   withdrawal symptoms -> consumes 3-5 beers per day, and has stopped
   drinking before without issue
   - continue with CIWA protocol
   .
   #) Hypertension: Monitor BP. No home meds. Consider antihypertensives
   if BP remains elevated.
   .
   #) Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin for now till LFTs trend down.
   .

The patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperlipidemia. He presents from the hospital ward for further management of cholangitis. The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which revealed a stone and significant amount of pus in the biliary system. A stent was placed during the procedure.

The patient's current conditions include fever, respiratory distress, and a urinary tract infection. He is experiencing pain and is receiving pain medication. The patient also has a history of alcohol abuse and is undergoing withdrawal management. His blood pressure is being monitored, and antihypertensive medications may be considered if the blood pressure remains elevated. The patient has hyperlipidemia but is not currently taking statin medication due to elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 103.1°F (39.5°C), blood pressure ranging from 110s-130s/67-96 mmHg, heart rate between 120s-130s bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. The patient's ABG results show respiratory alkalosis with a PaO2 of 45, and the CTA chest preliminary read"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 57 year old male with past medical history of
   hypertension, BPH, and hyperlipidemia who presents from [**Hospital Ward Name **] for
   further management of cholangitis.
   .
   #) Cholangitis: Status-post ERCP which revealed a stone and significant
   amount of pus and cholecystectomy. Stent was placed at that time.
   - Continue antibiotics with Unasyn
   - IVF as needed, though currently no longer tachycardic and BP stable
   - Follow up culture data here and at outside hospital.
   - Low dose dilaudid for pain control
   - f/u amylase/lipase and LFTs
   .
   #) Traumatic foley: 700c PVR with difficulty with foley insertion.
   -f/u urology consult with attempt at foley again later today
   #) Sleep apnea: pt. has never received a sleep study; no CPAP use at
   home.  Still in hypercarbic respiratory failure with improving mental
   status currently.
   -recheck ABG
   -Consider sleep study on outpt. Basis
   - may require auto CPAP when transferred to floor
   .
   #) EtOH history: illicit more in depth history in terms of prior
   withdrawal symptoms -> consumes 3-5 beers per day, and has stopped
   drinking before without issue
   - continue with CIWA protocol
   .
   #) Hypertension: Holding anti-hypertensives currently given cholangitis
   and potential development of hypotension related to infection.
   Pressures stable.
   .
   #) Hyperlipidemia: Holding statin for now.
   .
   #)FEN:
   - IVF as needed to support BP or if becomes tachycardic, otherwise will
   keep on some maitenance fluids
   - f/u I+Os with bladder scans before foley placement
   - Replete electrolytes
   - Diet: Clear liquids
   .
   #) Prophylaxis: Subutaneous heparin if okay with surgical team after
   surgery, otherwise pneumoboots.
   .
   #) Access: peripherals
   .
   #) Code:  Full (discussed with patient)
   .
   #) Communication: Patient
   .
   #) Disposition: ICU for now, pending clinical improvement

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 57-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and hyperlipidemia. He presents with cholangitis and underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) which revealed a stone and significant amount of pus in the biliary tree. A stent was placed during the procedure.

The patient has been experiencing fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. Blood and urine cultures have been sent, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with low lung volumes and the presence of small bilateral pleural effusions. There are also areas of atelectasis and retrocardiac atelectasis. A CT angiography (CTA) of the chest showed no pulmonary embolism (PE), but there were small bilateral pleural effusions with bibasilar atelectasis. A hypodensity in the liver was noted, which could be a hepatic cyst or a small fluid collection.

The patient's urinary catheter was initially removed but was reinserted due to significant post-void residual volume (PVR). Foley insertion was difficult, and urology was consulted. The patient has a history of sleep apnea and requires a sleep study, as well as potential auto CPAP on the floor if needed.

The patient's alcohol history revealed that he consumes 3-5"
