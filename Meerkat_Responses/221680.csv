   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation.
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.
   --- continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
   and Clindamycin until culture data returns
   (will f/u allergy hx w/ daughter)
   --- CHANGE TO [**Name (NI) **]/ AZTREONAM as per attndg recs
   --- d/c tamiflu and droplet precautions as influenza negative
   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella Sputum Cx if possible
   --- continue current vent settings, can change to PS 5/5 O/N to see how
   tolerates- PS 10/5 if needs help.
   --- continue midazolam, fentanyl for sedation; restraints
   --- perhaps SBT in AM w/ extubation soon?
   --- strict I's and O's, goal
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.
   --- continue levophed 0.18 mcg/kg/min for MAP ~65
   --- hold all home antihypertensive medications
   --- continue abx tx
   --- hold IVF as received 5.5 L in ED
   --- hold diuresis as on pressors
   --- goal CVL [**8-8**]
   --- track UOP
   --- check ABG, lactate
   --- check VBG
   3. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY- chronic problem, for which he is on
   prednisone as outpatient.
   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV
   --- monitor and replete electrolytes
   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission, so will hold
   coumadin for now and re-assess INR in the AM as to when to re-start
   anticoagulation.
   5. CHF- EF 25% on most recent TTE, holding BB and [**Last Name (un) **] due to
   hypotension and use of pressor. (unclear why on [**Name (NI) **] not ACE, allergy?)
   -- continue lipitor
   -- unclear why pt not on aspirin

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement. He presented with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which has led to an exacerbation of CHF.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, shock (hypotension requiring levophed), and adrenal insufficiency. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with settings of Vt 500 mL, RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, and O2 saturation at 99%. He also has a multi-lumen central line, PICC line, and is on broad-spectrum antibiotics (Vancomycin, Levofloxacin, and Clindamycin).

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates suggest a high risk for respiratory failure. The current ventilator settings are being maintained, and plans are in place for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and potential extubation soon.

2. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils, and history of bacterial pneumonia indicate a possible septic shock. The ongoing administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriate, and further cultures are pending.

2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressors. The etiology of shock could be cardiogenic or septic. Septic shock is more likely due to his warm extremities, fever, and history of bacterial pneumonias. Clindamycin will be continued for its inhibitory effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and endotoxin production. Pressor weaning will be considered once mean arterial pressure (MAP) is around 65.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has chronic adrenal insufficiency, for which he is on prednisone as an outpatient. Hydrocortisone will be continued at 100mg q8h IV, and electrolytes will be monitored and repleted as necessary.

4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR was 3.4 on"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation.
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.
   --- continue empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin, Levofloxacin
   and Clindamycin until culture data returns
   (will f/u allergy hx w/ daughter)
   --- CHANGE TO [**Name (NI) **]/ AZTREONAM as per attndg recs
   --- d/c tamiflu and droplet precautions as influenza negative
   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella Sputum Cx if possible
   --- continue current vent settings, can change to PS 5/5 O/N to see how
   tolerates- PS 10/5 if needs help.
   --- continue midazolam, fentanyl for sedation; restraints
   --- perhaps SBT in AM w/ extubation soon?
   --- strict I's and O's, goal
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.
   --- continue levophed 0.18 mcg/kg/min for MAP ~65
   --- hold all home antihypertensive medications
   --- continue abx tx
   --- hold IVF as received 5.5 L in ED
   --- hold diuresis as on pressors
   --- goal CVL [**8-8**]
   --- track UOP
   --- check ABG, lactate
   --- check VBG
   3. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY- chronic problem, for which he is on
   prednisone as outpatient.
   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV
   --- monitor and replete electrolytes
   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission, so will hold
   coumadin for now and re-assess INR in the AM as to when to re-start
   anticoagulation.
   5. CHF- EF 25% on most recent TTE, holding BB and [**Last Name (un) **] due to
   hypotension and use of pressor. (unclear why on [**Name (NI) **] not ACE, allergy?)
   -- continue lipitor
   -- unclear why pt not on aspirin

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 75-year-old male with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and a history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia.
- The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation with settings of Vt 500 mL, RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, and saturation at 99%.
- The patient has leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils, which could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or chronic steroid use.
- The patient has systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% and radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and cardiomegaly.
- The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected infectious pneumonia and CHF exacerbation.
- The patient is also being treated for adrenal insufficiency with hydrocortisone.
- The patient has a high INR, so Coumadin has been held.
- The patient's blood pressure is low, requiring vasopressor support.
- The patient's electrolytes need to be monitored and repleted.
- The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate) and DNI (do not intubate).

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of COPD, who is now experiencing respiratory failure due to CAP/HCAP and sepsis. The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, and is on low pressure support ventilation (PSV). Sedation weaning is ongoing.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 128/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute (due to mechanical ventilation), and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 2 cm H2O and remains on vasopressor support.

The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim, vancomycin, Ambien, augmentin, cephalexin, and IV dye. The last doses of antibiotics given were clindamycin on 10/30/2170 at 05:15 PM, aztreonam on 10/31/2170 at 12:23 AM, and vancomycin on 10/31/2170 at 08:00 AM.

The patient's medical history, social history, review of systems, and physical examination are unremarkable except for the noted conditions.

The patient's laboratory results show the following abnormalities: leukocyte count of 8.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 7.5 g/dL, platelet count of 267 K/uL, blood glucose of 119 mg/dL, sodium of 135 mEq/L, potassium of 4.2 mEq/L, and chloride of 98 mEq/L. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase/T bilirubin, and differential white blood cell count, are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include ongoing management of respiratory failure, optimization of COPD medications, treatment of pneumonia and potential pulmonary edema, monitoring of ABG and SaO2, consideration for stress dose steroids, continued supportive care for sepsis, monitoring for evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), and evaluation for line-related infection. The patient is also being considered for chronic anticoagulation to prevent pulmonary emboli and initiation of enteral nutrition if intubated.

The patient's ICU care includes glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and nutritional support. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and will remain in the ICU for further critical care."

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of COPD, who is now presenting with respiratory failure due to pneumonia and sepsis. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 128/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 0 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial and attributed to pneumonia. It is important to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor ABG and SaO2 levels. Empirical antimicrobials should be administered to treat the infection.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient may have pulmonary edema, which could be cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic in nature. Monitoring the patient's CXR and optimizing medications, including steroids and antimicrobials, will be important.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis and hypovolemia. Fluid resuscitation has already been performed, and the aim is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60 mmHg. Vasopressor support may be required.

4. Sepsis: The patient is concerned for sepsis, which"

   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation.
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.
   --- continue Vancomycin, aztreonam and levaquin
   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella Sputum Cx if possible
   --- stop sedation at 8am
   --- continue to wean vent settings PS 8/5
 [**5-1**] , reassess RISB/ SBT and
   possible extubation in PM
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.

   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV

   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission and 7 today, likely
   due to addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition.  Could consider
   swithing to azithromycin in future.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and a previous pulmonary embolism.
- He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough, likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which has exacerbated his CHF.
- The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.
- He has leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils, suggesting an infectious etiology.
- The patient is hypotensive and requires norepinephrine (Levophed) to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
- His INR is significantly elevated at 7.0.
- He has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is on chronic steroid use.
- The patient's condition is complex, with multiple medical complications including respiratory distress, shock, adrenal insufficiency, and CHF.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to hospital-acquired pneumonia and/or aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is essential.

2. Shock: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and hemodynamic parameters is necessary. Weaning off the pressor agent should be done carefully to maintain adequate MAP.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient's chronic steroid use for adrenal insuff"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), a history of atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrhythmia, and chronic steroid use. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which is perpetuating CHF exacerbation. The patient is intubated and on assisted ventilation. He has hypotension requiring norepinephrine infusion, evidence of fluid overload, and elevated INR. He also has a history of adrenal insufficiency and is on chronic prednisone.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to hospital-acquired pneumonia and possibly aspiration pneumonia. This requires broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive care.
2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires vasopressor support. The etiology is likely cardiogenic or septic shock. Septic shock should be considered due to the history of bacterial pneumonia and the effects of lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin).
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has chronic adrenal insufficiency and is on prednisone. Hydrocortisone should be continued to manage this condition.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to the addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition. Vitamin K can be given, and the decision to restart anticoagulation will depend on re-assessment"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation.
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.
   --- continue Vancomycin, aztreonam and levaquin
   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella Sputum Cx if possible
   --- continue to wean off sedation
   --- continue to wean vent settings PS 8/5
 [**5-1**] , reassess RISB/ SBT and
   possible extubation in PM
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.
   --- continue wean pressor for MAP ~65
   --- ct hold all home antihypertensive medications
   --- continue abx tx
   --- hold IVF as received 5.5 L in ED, reassess fluid balance and
   consider possible diuresis
   --- goal CVL [**8-8**]
   --- track UOP
   --- check ABG, lactate
   --- check VBG
   3. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY- chronic problem, for which he is on
   prednisone as outpatient.
   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV
   --- monitor and replete electrolytes
   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission and is 3.8 today,
   likely due to addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition.
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now and re-assess INR in the AM as to
   when to re-start anticoagulation.
   -- will have to modify anticoagulation regimen given poor nutritional
   status
   5. CHF- EF 25% on most recent TTE, holding BB and [**Last Name (un) **] due to
   hypotension and use of pressor. (unclear why on [**Name (NI) **] not ACE, allergy?)
   -- continue lipitor
   -- unclear why pt not on aspirin

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), history of atrial fibrillation, and prior pulmonary embolism. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia. The patient has been treated with antibiotics for the suspected infection. He is also receiving supportive care for shock, adrenal insufficiency, and CHF. His current condition is stable, but he remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress could be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. The presence of leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils suggests an infectious etiology.
2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive, requiring norepinephrine. The cause of hypotension could be cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient's warm extremities and history of bacterial pneumonia suggest that septic shock may be the likely cause.
3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has chronic adrenal insufficiency for which he is receiving prednisone. It is important to continue hydrocortisone replacement therapy.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to the addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition. Coumadin should be held until the INR is re-evaluated.
5. CHF: The patient has systolic heart failure with an e"

   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to pneumonia and
   component of pulmomary edema (cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic).
   Pneumonia may be precipitant.  Continue mechanical ventilation.
   Monitor ABG, SaO2.
   COPD -- optimize medications, including steroids, antimicrobials.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect attributable predominately to
   pneumonia , and component of CHF (underlying cardiomyopathy).
   Empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor CXR.
   HYPOTENSION -- attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia, contribution of
   PEEP.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of adrenal insufficiency (stress dose
   steroids).  s/p fluid resussitation.  Maintain vasopressor, aim MAP >60
   mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- concerns include pneumonia, line-related infection (right
   PICC).  Evaluation in progress (sputum, blood, urine, stool).  Continue
   supportive care.  Would d/c PICC line.
   CHF -- underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 15-25 %.  Monitor for evidence for
   overt CHF.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded following resussitation.  Plan monitor
   I/O, maintain balance.  IV fluid bolus as needed to maintain BP.
   COAGULOPATHY -- rising INR while holding coumadin, likely reflect
   nutrition and drug-effect (ex. Levofloxicin).  Consider FFP (or
   coumadin) if INR continues to rise.  Consider substituting
   Levofloxicin.  Monitor coags.
   h/o PULMONARY EMBOLI -- continue chronic anticoagulation once INR in
   therapeutic range.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- initiate TF if remains intubated.

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who is now experiencing respiratory failure due to pneumonia and sepsis. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient's blood pressure remains low and is being supported with vasopressors. The patient has a history of cardiomyopathy with an estimated ejection fraction of 15-25%. There are concerns about potential complications such as pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, and adrenal insufficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of respiratory failure may worsen due to the underlying COPD, pneumonia, and sepsis. Monitoring ABG and SaO2 levels will be crucial in managing this complication.
2. Pneumonia: The patient may develop further complications related to pneumonia, including worsening lung infiltrates and the possibility of a line-related infection.
3. Sepsis: With ongoing concerns about sepsis, the patient is at risk for organ dysfunction and failure. Continuous monitoring and supportive care are essential.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to maintain adequate blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg.
5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The possibility of adrenal insufficiency should be considered, especially in the context"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), now presenting with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has persistent hypotension and is on vasopressor support. There is concern for pulmonary infiltrates, possibly due to pneumonia or congestive heart failure (CHF), and the patient's low ejection fraction suggests an underlying cardiomyopathy. Sepsis is also a concern, with potential sources including pneumonia, line-related infection, or other infections. Fluid management is critical, as the patient has had fluid resuscitation but remains at risk for fluid overload. Coagulopathy is present, evidenced by a rising international normalized ratio (INR), and nutritional support is needed due to the prolonged intubation. The patient has a history of pulmonary emboli and requires chronic anticoagulation. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and they will be staying in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which may worsen if there are complications with mechanical ventilation or if underlying lung conditions progress.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has community-acquired pneumonia, and it may continue to worsen or spread to other areas of the lungs.
3. Sepsis: The patient is already septic, and without proper management, sepsis can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death.
4. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient's underlying cardiomyopathy and current pulmonary infiltrates suggest a risk for CHF exacerbation, leading to further respiratory compromise and systemic complications.
5. Coagulopathy: The rising INR indicates a bleeding risk, and if not managed appropriately, can lead to hemorrhagic complications.
6. Line-related infection: The patient's PICC line presents a risk for infection, which could worsen sepsis or become a localized infection.
7. Fluid overload: Given the patient's hypotension and fluid resuscitation, there is a risk for fluid overload, leading to pulmonary edema and cardiac dysfunction.
8. Nutritional deficiencies: Prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation increase the risk of malnutrition, which can impact recovery and overall prognosis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to severe pneumonia and sepsis. The patient remains hypotensive and is on vasopressor support. The patient's laboratory values indicate an elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, attributed to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. It is essential to continue mechanical ventilation and monitor arterial blood gases (ABG) and oxygen saturation (SaO2).

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may be a precipitant of respiratory failure. Empirical antimicrobials have been initiated, and monitoring of chest X-ray is necessary.

3. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's pulmonary edema is suspected to be attributable to pneumonia and possibly cardiogenic in nature. Monitoring for worsening pulmonary edema and optimizing cardiac support are necessary.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is attributed to sepsis, hypovolemia, and the contribution of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Stress dose steroids should be considered if adrenal insufficiency is suspected. Fluid resuscitation has been administered, and vasopressor support will be maintained to achieve"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation.
   1. DELERIUM/ CONFUSION-
   2. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.
   --- continue Vancomycin, aztreonam and levaquin
   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella Sputum Cx if possible
   --- stop sedation at 8am
   --- continue to wean vent settings PS 8/5
 [**5-1**] , reassess RISB/ SBT and
   possible extubation in PM
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.

   --- track UOP
   --- check ABG, lactate
   --- check VBG
   --- CXR today
   --- will need A-line likely for closer hemodynamic monitoring
   3. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY- chronic problem, for which he is on
   prednisone as outpatient.
   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV
   --- monitor and replete electrolytes
   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission and 7 today, likely
   due to addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition.  Could consider
   swithing to azithromycin in future.
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now and re-assess INR in the AM as to
   when to re-start anticoagulation.
   -- will have to modify anticoagulation regimen given poor nutritional
   status
   -- give 2.5mg vitamin K x1
   5. CHF- EF 25% on most recent TTE, holding BB and [**Last Name (un) **] due to
   hypotension and use of pressor. (unclear why on [**Name (NI) **] not ACE, allergy?)

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), and chronic steroid use. The patient presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia, which is perpetuating CHF exacerbation.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information in the note include:

1. Delirium/Confusion: The patient's sedation and use of multiple medications may contribute to delirium or confusion.

2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's chronic steroid use makes him more susceptible to infections.

3. Shock: The patient is hypotensive and requires Levophed, suggesting possible cardiogenic or septic shock. The patient's warm extremities and history of bacterial pneumonias suggest peripheral vasodilation due to lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin).

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a chronic problem of adrenal insufficiency for which he is on prednisone as an outpatient. The patient's low blood pressure and electrolyte imbalances may indicate an acute exacerbation of adrenal insufficiency.

5. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated, likely due to the addition of fluoroquinolone"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 75 year-old gentleman with systolic CHF (EF 15-25%) s/p
   ICD, a-fib s/p DCCV x2 and AVN ablation, hx PE on Coumadin,who presents
   with respiratory distress, fevers and cough likely due to bacterial
   pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation. Patient is not delirious or
   confused as he is A&Ox3, just agitated post extubation
   1. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS- multifactorial causes of respiratory distress
   include hospital-acquired pnuemonia (as patient is chronic nursing home
   resident) plus or minus aspiration pneumonia (unclear if patient is at
   risk for aspiration) and volume overload from congestive heart failure.
   Clinical history, chest X-ray, risk factors, leukocytosis with
   predominantly neutrophils argues for infectious etiology. However,
   leukocytosis could also be a result of chronic steroid use for adrenal
   insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use leads to susceptibility to
   infection!) Patient has systolic heart failure with EF of 35%, and
   appears to clinically be in heart failure by physical examination.
   Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and
   cardiomegaly support this claim. Patient is intubated on AC w/ vent
   settings- Vt 500 x RR 18, FiO2 40%, PEEP 5, satting 99%. Therefore,
   will treat w/ broad spectrum abx for infectious pna, with atypical
   coverage, as well as for chf.

   --- follow-up BCx, UCx, U/A, urine legionella  is negative
   --- follow-up Sputum Cx
   --- sputum Cx,tanding tylenol for fevers
   --- ct albuterol nebs q4h prn and standing ipratropium nebs q6h
   --- Chest PT
   2. SHOCK- patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. etiology includes
   cardiogenic vs. septic shock. Patient's extremities are warm,
   well-perfused, he is febrile and has history of bacterial pnuemonias in
   the past; likely cause of hypotension is due to peripheral
   vasodilitation from lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Therefore,
   clindamycin would be an appropriate antibiotic due to its inhibitory
   effects on prokaryotic protein synthesis and thus endotoxin production.
   --- continue wean pressor for MAP ~65

   --- hold IVF as received 5.5 L in ED, reassess fluid balance and
   consider possible diuresis
   --- give 1 L NS bolus over 60min to see if BP responds, no diuresis
   --- goal CVL [**8-8**]
   --- track UOP
   --- check ABG, lactate
   --- check VBG
   --- CXR today
   --- will need A-line likely for closer hemodynamic monitoring
   3. ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY- chronic problem, for which he is on
   prednisone as outpatient.
   --- continue hydrocortisone 100mg q8 h IV
   --- monitor and replete electrolytes
   4. SUPRATHERAPEUTIC INR- INR was 3.4 on admission and 7 today, likely
   due to addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition.  Could consider
   swithing to azithromycin in future.
   -- continue to hold coumadin for now and re-assess INR in the AM as to
   when to re-start anticoagulation.
   -- will have to modify anticoagulation regimen given poor nutritional
   status
   -- give 2.5mg vitamin K x1
   5. CHF- EF 25% on most recent TTE, holding BB and [**Last Name (un) **] due to
   hypotension and use of pressor. (unclear why on [**Name (NI) **] not ACE, allergy?)
   -- continue lipitor
   -- unclear why pt not on aspirin

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with systolic congestive heart failure (EF 15-25%), history of ICD, atrial fibrillation s/p dual chamber cardioversion x2, and AV nodal ablation, on Coumadin, presenting with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough likely due to bacterial pneumonia perpetuating CHF exacerbation. The patient is alert and oriented, but agitated post-extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has multifactorial causes of respiratory distress, including hospital-acquired pneumonia and volume overload from congestive heart failure. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Shock: The patient is hypotensive, requiring levophed. The etiology is unclear between cardiogenic and septic shock. If septic shock is the cause, there is a risk of ongoing hypotension, organ dysfunction, and potential need for vasopressor support.

3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a chronic problem of adrenal insufficiency, for which he is on prednisone as an outpatient. Insufficient glucocorticoid levels can lead to hypotension, electrolyte imbalances, and potentially fatal complications if not promptly managed.

4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated due to the addition of fluoroquinolone and poor nutrition. This increases the"

   75 [**Hospital 5332**] nursing home resident, COPD, now with CAP/HCAP and sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- multifactorial, attributed to pneumonia and
   component of pulmomary edema (cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic).
   Pneumonia may be precipitant.  Stable following extubation.  Monitor
   ABG, SaO2.
   COPD -- optimize medications, including steroids, antimicrobials.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- suspect attributable predominately to
   pneumonia , and component of CHF (underlying cardiomyopathy).
   Empirical antimicrobials.  Monitor CXR.
   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Responded to iv fluid bolus yesterday,
   allowing discontinuation of vasoopressor.  Attributed to sepsis,
   hypovolemia, contribution of PEEP.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of adrenal

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of COPD, who was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, hypoxemia, and sepsis. The patient experienced respiratory failure, pulmonary infiltrates, hypotension, and adrenal insufficiency during their ICU stay. They have underlying cardiomyopathy with an EF of 15-25%. The patient's coagulopathy improved after receiving vitamin K and discontinuing Coumadin. They also have a history of pulmonary emboli and require chronic anticoagulation. The patient is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure due to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of ABG and SaO2 levels is necessary.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which may require optimization of medications, including steroids and antimicrobials. Monitoring of CXR is essential.
3. Pulmonary Infiltrates: The patient has pulmonary infiltrates, likely attributable to pneumonia and a component of congestive heart failure (CHF). Empirical antimicrobials should be administered, and CXR monitoring is required.
4. Hypotension: The patient had hypotension, which resolved after an IV fluid bolus. This was likely due to sepsis, hypovolemia"

   HYPOTENSION -- Resolved.  Responded to iv fluid bolus yesterday,
   allowing discontinuation of vasoopressor.  Attributed to sepsis,
   hypovolemia, contribution of PEEP.  [**Month (only) 8**] be component of adrenal
   insufficiency (stress dose steroids).  s/p fluid resussitation.
   Maintain vasopressor, aim MAP >60 mmHg.
   SEPSIS -- resolved.
   ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY -- taper steroids to baseline dose.
   CHF -- underlying cardiomyopathy, EF 15-25 %.  Monitor for evidence for
   overt CHF.
   FLUIDS -- net volume expanded following resussitation.  Plan monitor
   I/O, maintain balance.  IV fluid bolus as needed to maintain BP.  D/C

The patient is a 75-year-old nursing home resident with a history of COPD, now presenting with CAP/HCAP and sepsis. The patient experienced respiratory failure, which was multifactorial and attributed to pneumonia and pulmonary edema. The patient's pneumonia was treated with empirical antimicrobials, and they remain stable post-extubation.

   sputum is growing out multi-drug resistant klebsiella and volume
   overload from congestive heart failure. Clinical history, chest X-ray,
   risk factors, leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils argues for
   infectious etiology. However, leukocytosis could also be a result of
   chronic steroid use for adrenal insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use
   leads to susceptibility to infection!) Patient has systolic heart
   failure with EF of 35%, and appears to clinically be in heart failure

","The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (EF 15-25%), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), atrial fibrillation (a-fib) status post dual-chamber cardioversion (DCCV) and atrioventricular nodal ablation, and a history of pulmonary embolism on Coumadin. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough due to multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumonia potentially perpetuating congestive heart failure exacerbation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia: This can lead to worsening respiratory distress and may require aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
2. Congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 35% makes him susceptible to further worsening of heart failure symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fluid retention, and decreased cardiac output.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has a chronic problem of adrenal insufficiency, for which he is on prednisone as an outpatient. It is essential to continue hydrocortisone replacement therapy and monitor and replete electrolytes.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's international normalized ratio (INR) is currently elevated, likely due to Coumadin therapy. It is necessary to hold Coumadin for now and reassess IN"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and previous episodes of pulmonary embolism. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough due to multi-drug resistant klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and mechanically ventilated.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress may be multifactorial, including hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by multi-drug resistant klebsiella and volume overload from congestive heart failure. The presence of leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils suggests an infectious etiology, which could be exacerbated by chronic steroid use for adrenal insufficiency.

2. Shock: The patient is off pressors and maintaining blood pressure, but there is a concern for possible shock. It is recommended to hold all home antihypertensive medications, continue antibiotic therapy, and reassess fluid balance and consider possible diuresis. Monitoring of vital signs, central venous pressure (CVP), urine output (UOP), and arterial blood gas (ABG) should be done regularly.

3. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has a chronic problem of adrenal insufficiency, for which he is on prednisone as an outpatient. It is important to continue hydrocortisone 50 mg q8h IV and taper"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and prior electrical cardioversions and ablation. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough due to multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia. The patient has several medical conditions including hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, supratherapeutic INR, CHF exacerbation, and anemia. He is currently receiving treatment for the pneumonia, hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, and CHF. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure of 103/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high-flow nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Prolonged hospitalization and exposure to healthcare-associated infections due to the patient's immunocompromised state.
2. Development of antibiotic resistance in the Klebsiella pneumonia infection if the current treatment regimen is not effective.
3. Worsening of CHF symptoms if the patient's heart function does not improve.
4. Adrenal crisis if the hydrocortisone taper is not managed properly.
5. Bleeding complications due to the supratherapeutic INR.
6. Acute blood loss exacerbating the patient's anemia.
7. Possible malnutrition and poor nutritional status affecting wound healing and overall"

   sputum is growing out multi-drug resistant klebsiella and volume
   overload from congestive heart failure. Clinical history, chest X-ray,
   risk factors, leukocytosis with predominantly neutrophils argues for
   infectious etiology. However, leukocytosis could also be a result of
   chronic steroid use for adrenal insufficiency. (And chronic steroid use
   leads to susceptibility to infection!) Patient has systolic heart
   failure with EF of 35%, and appears to clinically be in heart failure
   by physical examination. Radiographic evidence of bilateral pulmonary
   infiltrates and cardiomegaly support this claim.  He appeared volume

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and previous cardiac interventions. He presented with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough due to multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumonia. The patient also has adrenal insufficiency and is on chronic steroid use, which increases his susceptibility to infections. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia and CHF exacerbation, leading to his current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumonia: The patient has an active infection with multidrug-resistant klebsiella pneumonia, which can lead to worsening respiratory distress and potential sepsis.
2. Congestive heart failure exacerbation: The patient's pre-existing systolic CHF may worsen due to fluid overload from the infection and inadequate cardiac function.
3. Adrenal insufficiency: The patient has chronic adrenal insufficiency, requiring long-term steroid use. This condition makes him more susceptible to infections and adrenal crisis if not managed properly.
4. Supratherapeutic INR: The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a risk of bleeding if anticoagulation is resumed without appropriate monitoring and adjustment.
5. Shock: The patient has had episodes of shock, requiring pressor support. It is important to closely monitor hemodynamics and adjust fluid and inotrope therapy accordingly.
6. Electrolyte imbalances: Chronic steroid use can lead to electrolyte disturbances, particularly"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old gentleman with a history of systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, and previous defibrillator implantation. He presents with respiratory distress, fevers, and cough due to multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia. His current conditions include hypertension, adrenal insufficiency, supratherapeutic INR, CHF exacerbation, and anemia. 

The patient has received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and has been administered additional potassium due to hypokalemia. He has also been given tigecycline and colistin, with their sensitivities still pending. The patient's allergies include hives from Bactrim, diarrhea from vancomycin, and unknown reactions to Augmentin, cephalexin, and IV dye. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range 35.8-36.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate range 70-80 bpm, blood pressure range 162/74-170/84 mmHg, respiratory rate range 19-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and abnormal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal range. 

The patient's plan includes continuing meropenem for a 14-day course,"
