   Imaging: [**2193-2-21**] - CXR Preliminary Report !! WET READ !!  Very limited
   film, patient rotated and unable to sit straight. Small-moderate
   left effusion, retrocardiac opacity concerning for PNA vs atelectasis.
   [**2193-2-21**] - CT ABDOMEN: Evaluation is limited by absence of oral or
   intravenous contrast material, and patient body habitus.
   Visualized lung bases show moderate dependent bibasilar atelectasis,
   left
   greater than right, and diffuse ground-glass opacities, which are non-
   specific. Overall, aeration of the lung bases is improved compared to
   prior.
   Liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys have unremarkable
   non- contrast appearance. Intra- abdominal loops of small bowel are
   within normal
   limits. Gastrostomy tube in the stomach is noted. There is no free
   intraperitoneal air. Trace ascites is seen throughout the abdomen,
   unchanged from prior exam.
   Apparent wall thickening, extending from the ascending colon to the
   splenic
   flexure is not significantly changed since previous exam, though wall
   thickening in the transverse colon may have slightly worsened.
   Pericolonic
   inflammatory stranding is not significantly changed. Wall thickening
   and pericolonic stranding is also seen to involve a segment of the
   sigmoid colon, which appears new in the interval.Uterus and adnexa are
   unremarkable. Urinary bladder is decompressed with Foley catheter in
   place. A rectal catheter is in place.
   S-shaped thoracolumbar scoliosis and associated degenerative changes
   stable.
   IMPRESSION: Limited study. Interval worsening of colitis extending from
   the
   ascending colon to the splenic flexure, with new area of involvement
   within the sigmoid colon. Etiology of the colitis may be due to
   infection or inflammation; given the extent of colonic involvement,
   ischemia is considered less likely.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF,
   DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic resp
   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU from rehab with
   fevers, bacteremia and abdominal pain.
   .
   # Fevers: Patient has several possible sources at this time. She is
   complaining of abdominal pain and has evidence of colitis, albeit
   unchanged from prior, on CT scan in the ED. LFT's are wnl, as are
   pancreatic enzymes. Given that she had been on multiple abx, most
   recently levofloxacin for a UTI, c diff is on the differential.
   Additionally, she is growing staph from her blood cultures, likely epi,
   and received vanco for this at [**Hospital1 664**]. Has received levoflox for 1 day
   for a dirty UA. The picc that she has in place is the same one that was
   placed here at [**Hospital1 1**] on [**2193-2-15**] prior to d/c. On last admission, sputum
   and urine grew yeast, mycolytic/fungal cultures were negative. [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] was isolated.
   - continue vanco for staph epi bacteremia
   - will need to pull picc and send tip for culture but will need better
   access first, if possible, midline. No indication for CVL at this time,
   patient is hemodynamically stable at this time.
   - Send for blood cultures tomorrow morning for surveillance; blood
   cultures x 2 pending from ED
   - Send for c diff
   - Send UA, urine culture
   - empiric treatment for pyelo for now, although no evidence of
   stranding on CT, not sensitive and patient cannot receive contrast at
   this time
   - continue levofloxacin for empiric treatment of pyelo, but can broaden
   if patient decompensates to aztreonam, given that she was admitted for
   some time here recently
   - patient received dose of flagyl in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] continue here for now,
   can d/c if we isolate a source
   - check CXR and sputum cx
   - cooling blanket, tylenol prn
   .
   # Abdominal Pain: unclear- per [**Name (NI) 664**], was right flank, which is
   consistent with my exam here. CT here shows stable colitis and no
   evidence of pyelo but lower sensitivity for this. No evidence of
   billiary ductal dilitation or pancreatitis.
   - c diff, repeat UA
   - empiric treatment for pyelo
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Will need free water flushes through the peg plus [**1-11**]
   NS to replete free water deficit of 8.5L. Only received 1L NS in ED.
   Will give
 normal saline @ 200cc/hr x 2L overnight to start.
   - check sodium at 12am
   .
   # ARF: creatinine is actually trending down from last hospital day here
   (4.5, now 3.6). Initial insult was thought to be ATN and was on CRRT
   temporarily on last admission. Monitor UOP. Patient is free water down,
   so there may be a component of prerenal azotemia as well.
   - monitor UOP
   - free water repletion
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure - on vent, seems comfortable. Will check
   CXR to ensure no new infiltrate.
   - MDI's, trach care, suctioning
   .
   # COPD - continue MDI's as above
   .
   # dCHF - is free water down, overall. Will need IVF. Watch sats and
   vent settings for evidence of pulmonary edema..
   .
   # DM2: insulin SS
   .
   # FEN: needs free water. replete lytes prn. Can try TF's but will
   likely need to hold given abd pain and unclear source of fever.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. She is now readmitted to the MICU with fevers, bacteremia, and abdominal pain.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 103.3°F (39.6°C), heart rate of 108 bpm (with a range of 95-112 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 139/62 mmHg to 179/93 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute (with a set rate of 14 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 97% on high flow nasal cannula and tracheostomy.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 15.6 thousand/mm³, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) at 153 mg/dL, elevated procalcitonin level at 25.1 ng/mL, and elevated lactate level at 2.1 mmol/L. Blood cultures are pending for both gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as gram-positive rods. Urine culture is also pending.

Imaging studies reveal moderate dependent bibasilar atelectasis, left greater than right, and diffuse ground"

   ascending colon to the splenic flexure, with new area of involvement
   within the sigmoid colon. Etiology of the colitis may be due to
   infection or inflammation; given the extent of colonic involvement,
   ischemia is considered less likely.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF,
   DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic resp
   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU from rehab with
   fevers, bacteremia and abdominal pain.
   .
   # Fevers/Abdominal Pain: Patient
s abdominal exam is progressing, now
   with rebound and guarding with persistent high fevers. C diff is
   positive. Other culture data still pending, but dirty UA, sputum
   culture with GPC
s, GNR
s (but likely resp flora), and staph (likely
   epi) on blood cultures. That being said, her clinical picture is most
   consistent with c diff colitis, wbc is trending up.
   - stat KUB, surgery c/s
   - serial abdominal exams
   - add PO vanco to PO flagyl
   - continue vanco for staph epi bacteremia, follow repeat cultures
   - will need to pull picc and place CVL
   - Send UA, urine culture
   - would continue levofloxacin for now
   - cooling blanket, tylenol prn
   - IVF
   # Hypernatremia: Will need free water flushes through the peg plus [**1-11**]
   NS to replete free water deficit of 8.5L. Sodium is trending down
   slowly with
 NS @ 200cc per hour. Will need to continue for total of 6
   L today (plus free water boluses).
   - check sodium at 5pm.
   # ARF: creatinine continues to trend down with IVF, initial insult was
   ATN
   - monitor UOP
   - free water repletion
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure - on vent, VBG indicates that we can go
   up on Tv and peep.
   - MDI's, trach care, suctioning
   - recheck VBG after vent changes.
   # COPD - continue MDI's as above
   # dCHF - is free water down, overall. Will need IVF. Watch sats and
   vent settings for evidence of pulmonary edema..
   # DM2: insulin SS
   .
   # Skin: recovering from drug rash. Wound c/s.
   # FEN: needs free water. replete lytes prn. Can try TF's but will
   likely need to hold given abd pain and unclear source of fever.
   # PPX
   - DVT: SC heparin 7500 TID, PPI
   - Stress ulcer: PPI
   # Access:
   - right sided picc

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF, DM2, and HTN. She was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement. She is now readmitted to the MICU with fevers, bacteremia, and abdominal pain.

The patient has several medical complications:

1. Fever: The patient has a fever of 103.3°F (39.6°C) and is experiencing high fevers, indicating an infectious process.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection: The patient tested positive for C. diff toxin A and B, which suggests an infection caused by Clostridium difficile bacteria.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's blood cultures show growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, as well as gram-positive rods. This indicates a bacterial infection in the bloodstream.

4. Abdominal pain: The patient is experiencing abdominal pain with rebound and guarding, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process in the abdomen.

5. Colitis: The patient has colitis, which is inflammation of the colon. Imaging studies show wall thickening and pericolonic inflammatory stranding extending from the ascending colon to the splenic flexure, with new involvement in the sigmoid colon. The etiology of the colitis"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure from OSA and COPD, who underwent tracheostomy and peg a few weeks ago. She presents with fever, bacteremia, UTI, abdominal pain, and Clostridium difficile (CDiff) positivity. The patient has renal failure, hypernatremia, colitis, respiratory failure, fever, and impaired skin integrity.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and reduced urine output. This can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and uremic symptoms.

2. CDiff Colitis: The patient has a positive test for CDiff, indicating an infection caused by this bacteria. If left untreated, it can lead to severe inflammation and damage to the colon, resulting in symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may indicate dehydration or impaired water balance. If not corrected, it can cause neurological symptoms, including confusion, seizures, and even coma.

4. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the blood indicates a systemic infection. If not treated promptly, it can progress to sepsis, leading to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.

5. Respiratory Failure: The patient's chronic respiratory failure is likely exacerbated by her underlying conditions, such as OSA and COPD"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure from OSA and COPD who underwent tracheostomy and peg a few weeks ago. She presents with fever, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), abdominal pain, and Clostridium difficile (CDiff) positivity. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are elevated, indicating potential kidney dysfunction.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which may be due to dehydration or imbalances in electrolytes.
3. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream suggests a systemic infection.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic respiratory failure, possibly due to underlying COPD.
5. Impaired skin integrity: The patient has diffuse erythema and desquamation, indicating compromised skin health.
6. Colitis (other than Cdiff): The patient has rebound tenderness in the right flank and a thickened colon on CT scan, suggesting inflammation in the colon.
7. Fever: The patient has persistent fever, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process.

These are the potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of respiratory failure due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) a few weeks ago. She presents with fever, bacteremia, urinary tract infection (UTI), abdominal pain, and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection.

The patient's medical history includes resolving drug rash, and she has been experiencing fever, rebound tenderness in the right flank, and no bowel sounds. She has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is currently being treated with oral Flagyl. A surgery consult has been requested to further evaluate her condition.

The patient is also suffering from acute renal failure, hypernatremia (high sodium levels), chronic respiratory failure, fever, impaired skin integrity, and bacteremia caused by Gram-positive cocci (GPCocci). The source of the bacteremia is suspected to be either the peripheral intravenous catheter (PICC) line or the skin, with desquamation and blistering present.

The patient's current treatment plan includes changing the PICC line to a central venous line (CVL), administering vancomycin (Vanc) at the appropriate level, and broadening the antibiotic coverage if necessary. Pain control is being managed with acetaminophen as needed, and the patient is receiving hydration intravenously. The ventilator"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF,
   DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic resp
   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU from rehab with
   fevers, bacteremia and abdominal pain.
   .
   # Fevers/Abdominal Pain: Patient
s abdominal exam is progressing, now
   with rebound and guarding with persistent high fevers. C diff is
   positive. Other culture data still pending, but dirty UA, sputum
   culture with GPC
s, GNR
s (but likely resp flora), and staph (likely
   epi) on blood cultures. That being said, her clinical picture is most
   consistent with c diff colitis, wbc is trending up.
   - stat KUB, surgery c/s
   - serial abdominal exams
   - add PO vanco to PO flagyl
   - continue vanco for staph epi bacteremia, follow repeat cultures
   - will need to pull picc and place CVL
   - Send UA, urine culture
   - would continue levofloxacin for now
   - cooling blanket, tylenol prn
   - IVF
   # Hypernatremia: Will need free water flushes through the peg plus [**1-11**]
   NS to replete free water deficit of 8.5L. Sodium is trending down
   slowly with
 NS @ 200cc per hour. Will need to continue for total of 6
   L today (plus free water boluses).
   - check sodium at 5pm.
   # ARF: creatinine continues to trend down with IVF, initial insult was
   ATN
   - monitor UOP
   - free water repletion
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure - on vent, VBG indicates that we can go
   up on Tv and peep.
   - MDI's, trach care, suctioning
   - recheck VBG after vent changes.
   # COPD - continue MDI's as above
   # dCHF - is free water down, overall. Will need IVF. Watch sats and
   vent settings for evidence of pulmonary edema..
   # DM2: insulin SS

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF, DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. She is now readmitted to the MICU from rehab with fevers, bacteremia, and abdominal pain. The patient's abdominal exam is worsening, with rebound tenderness. C. diff colitis has been confirmed, and other culture data is pending. The patient's clinical picture is most consistent with C. diff colitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has fevers, bacteremia, and worsening abdominal pain, indicating a potential infection that could progress to sepsis.
2. Pneumothorax: The chest X-ray shows a possible pneumothorax, which needs to be confirmed and managed appropriately.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible kidney injury. Free water repletion and careful medication dosing are necessary.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level, requiring free water flushes and IV fluids to replete the water deficit.
5. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation, and adjustments may be needed to optimize ventilation settings.
6. COPD exacerbation: The patient has"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF,
   DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic resp
   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU with sepsis, found to
   have C. diff colitis and coag neg staph bacteremia. HD stable.
   .
   # Sepsis
 Pt with multiple sources on infection including C. diff
   colitis and bacteremia. Also concern for UTI. Pt persistently febrile
   overnight. Requiring IVF boluses/no pressors
   - Continue IVF boluses based on HR, BP and UOP. Consider addition of
   low dose neosynephrine if UOP persistently low to maintain higher MAP
   for increased perfusion
   - Trend lactate
   - Treat infectious etiologies as below
   #. C. diff colitis
 Pt found to be C. diff + on admission, abd exam
   concerning for rebound but no evidence of perforation on abd CT. Exam
   stable overnight.
   - Appreciate ID recs, optimize regimen with PO and PR vancomycin in
   addition to IV flagyl
   - Minimize additional systemic antimicrobials in setting of C. diff
   - Appreciate Gen [**Doctor First Name **] recs, continue to monitor abd exam, high
   threshold for OR given pt significant comorbidities and high operative
   risk
   .
   # Coagulase neg Staph bacteremia
 1 set of cultures + from OSH.
   Surveillance cultures neg to date. Pt at risk for line related
   infection, PICC now DC
 tip culture pending
   - Continue Vancomycin, dose by level given rapid fluctuation of renal
   function
 give dose today for level 17
   - Monitor surveillance cultures
   .
   # ? UTI
 dirty UA from OSH, cultures with 100K yeast, unclear timing
   of culture in relation to abx administration, repeat cultures here
   pending
   - will continue levaquin for now and f/u on ID recs, prefer to minimize
   antimicrobials in setting of C.diff
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: On previous admission pt had ATN in
   setting of hypotension, Cr had improved 2.7, now rising despite IVF
   - monitor UOP
   - renally dose medications
   .
   # Hypernatremia: Resolved with free water repletion, continue to trend
   .
   # Chronic Respiratory Failure - on vent, follow VBGs, given high minute
   ventilation currently, will hold on attempting trach mask and rest on
   vent for now
   - MDI's, trach care, suctioning
   .
   # COPD - continue MDI's
   # dCHF - Watch sats and vent settings for evidence of pulmonary edema

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname **] continues to need high amounts
   of fluid ( so far 8 L overnight alerady) for oliguria. She is also
   febrile to 101 with minute ventilation of nearly 20 L on current
   settings. Edema has worsened. Appreciate input from surgical
   colleagues. Lactate has also climbed with Rx to 2.7. She is now
   dependent on pressors.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.5 BP 110/55 HR 110  RR of 20-28 with sats of
   97% on 50% and 12 PEEP . massive anasarca with resolving skin exanthem.
   left SCL present. She is in pain on abdominal palpation but diffusely
   tender too. She remains capable of responding to commands.
   Labs notable for WBC 28.1 K , HCT of 38! , K 5.1 , Cr of 4.3 ( 3.8) ,
   lactate 2.9. CXR with left basal ASD/ atelectasis and
   cardiomegaly. cultures so far pos for C. Diff and GPC in blood.
   She has clinically worsened despite aggressive rescucitation. GI and ID
   input appreciated. We will increase dose of Vancomycin per G tube. We
   will also start IVIG Rx. She has features of developing end organ
   dysfunction ( renal failure, acidosis, respiratory needs that have
   escalated and shock) . Xigris infusion will be started to help with
   microcirculatory ischemia if surgery is not being planned at this
   time.  IR guided line for CVVH to be established as this will need to
   be started on account of massive anasarca and acidosis. Peep to be
   optimized to offset worsening abdominal distension.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

   failure s/p trach/peg, now readmitted to the MICU with sepsis, found to
   have C. diff colitis and coag neg staph bacteremia. HD stable.
   # Perforation:  Overnight Ms. [**Known lastname **] required continued boluses of
   IVF for low UOP and increasing lactate which was presumed [**2-11**] sepsis.
   This morning, surgery team was called regarding worsened status and
   recommendation was for repeat CT ABD/Pelvis which on admission was
   negative for perforation.  CT scan now showing significant
   perforation.  Surgery Team called STAT and have come to the bedside.
   Husband was notified and is pondering decision on surgical
   intervention.  Per the Surgery team, Ms. [**Known lastname **] is a poor surgical
   candidate and with poor survial.  [**Hospital 4110**] medical management will also
   likely lead to her demise.  Surgical Attending is going to call the
   husband to discuss surgical option.
   -- awaiting surgery recs.  If husband agrees then patient will go to OR
   immediately

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus type 2, and hypertension. She was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. She is now readmitted to the MICU with sepsis, C. difficile colitis, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been rising despite receiving intravenous fluids, indicating potential renal dysfunction.
2. Hypernatremia: The patient initially presented with high sodium levels, but they have resolved with free water repletion. Close monitoring is needed to prevent recurrence.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has an ongoing infection with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, which may require further treatment and surveillance.
4. C. difficile Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile infection, which can lead to severe colitis and may require additional treatment with oral and rectal vancomycin.
5. Chronic Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has a history of chronic respiratory failure. Careful monitoring of vital signs and adjustment of ventilator settings are necessary.
6. UTI: There is a suspicion of urinary tract infection, and repeat cultures are"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mrs [**Known lastname **] continues to need high amounts
   of fluid ( so far 8 L overnight alerady) for oliguria. She is also
   febrile to 101 with minute ventilation of nearly 20 L on current
   settings. Edema has worsened. Appreciate input from surgical
   colleagues. Lactate has also climbed with Rx to 2.7. She is now
   dependent on pressors.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.5 BP 110/55 HR 110  RR of 20-28 with sats of
   97% on 50% and 12 PEEP . massive anasarca with resolving skin exanthem.
   left SCL present. She is in pain on abdominal palpation but diffusely
   tender too. She remains capable of responding to commands.
   Labs notable for WBC 28.1 K , HCT of 38! , K 5.1 , Cr of 4.3 ( 3.8) ,
   lactate 2.9. CXR with left basal ASD/ atelectasis and
   cardiomegaly. cultures so far pos for C. Diff and GPC in blood.
   She has clinically worsened despite aggressive rescucitation. GI and ID
   input appreciated. We will increase dose of Vancomycin per G tube. We
   will also start IVIG Rx. She has features of developing end organ
   dysfunction ( renal failure, acidosis, respiratory needs that have
   escalated and shock) . Xigris infusion will be started to help with
   microcirculatory ischemia if surgery is not being planned at this
   time.  IR guided line for CVVH to be established as this will need to
   be started on account of massive anasarca and acidosis. Peep to be
   optimized to offset worsening abdominal distension.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, dCHF, DM2, HTN, who was recently admitted for hypoxic/hypercarbic respiratory failure and now readmitted to the MICU with sepsis. She has multiple sources of infection including C. diff colitis and bacteremia, and there is concern for a urinary tract infection as well. The patient is persistently febrile overnight and requires IVF boluses, with a plan to consider low-dose neosynephrine if urine output persists low to maintain higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) for increased renal perfusion. Lactate levels are being trended, and the patient's infectious etiologies are being treated accordingly.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient has acute on chronic renal failure, with rising creatinine levels despite IVF. Monitoring urine output and adjusting medication dosages accordingly is important.
2. Colitis: The patient has C. diff colitis, which is being treated with oral and rectal vancomycin in addition to IV flagyl. It is crucial to minimize additional systemic antimicrobials in the setting of C. diff.
3. Bacteremia: The patient has coagulase-negative Staph bacteremia, and cultures are pending. Surveillance cultures are negative to date. Vancomycin is being continued, with dosing based on renal function.
