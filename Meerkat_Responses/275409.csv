   #.Acetominophen Toxicity. Received acetyl cysteine loading dose at
   [**Hospital3 735**]. Toxicity level 16 at presentation to [**Hospital1 19**]. LFTs flat
   now. 16 hr NAC to end today at 11:30. Toxicology on board
   -recheck LFTs, INR, APAP level at 11:30. If LFTs elevated, APAP >10  or
   coagulopathic, would need another 16 hrs NAC. Otherwise, no further tx
   necessary

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression and previous suicide attempt. He was found unconscious at home in a vomitus state due to toxic ingestion of alcohol and multiple medications. The toxic screen was positive for acetaminophen. He received an acetylcysteine loading dose and his liver function tests (LFTs) are currently flat. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and is expected to be extubated this afternoon after weaning off propofol. He is also at risk for prolonged QTc due to multiple SSRIs and antipsychotics ingested, as well as serotonin syndrome. His respiratory failure is improving, and he will undergo a trial of spontaneous breathing. The patient still has a hard neck collar placed by EMS and needs further evaluation for potential neck trauma. Once extubated and able to communicate, the patient will be consulted with social work and psychiatry for recent suicide attempt and potential inpatient psychiatric hospitalization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acetaminophen toxicity: The patient has a positive toxic screen for acetaminophen, which can cause liver damage. Close monitoring of liver function tests is necessary, and additional treatment with acetylcysteine may be required if there are elevated LFTs or an APAP level greater than 10.

2. Other toxic ingestions: The patient is at risk for prolonged QTc due to the ingestion of multiple SSRIs and ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression who was found unconscious at home due to a toxic ingestion of alcohol and medication. He presented with acetaminophen toxicity, for which he received a loading dose of acetylcysteine. His toxicity level was 16 at presentation. He is currently intubated for airway protection and is being closely monitored. Lab results show elevated liver enzymes and low potassium levels. The patient will continue to be monitored for any complications related to the toxic ingestion, including liver damage, cardiac abnormalities, and respiratory status. He is also being evaluated for depression and potential psychosocial support.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acetaminophen-induced liver damage: The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of acetaminophen toxicity, which can lead to severe liver damage if not treated promptly. Monitoring of liver function tests (LFTs) and administration of acetylcysteine are ongoing.

2. Cardiac abnormalities: Prolonged QRS or QTc intervals on EKG may indicate potential cardiac complications. The patient's EKG will be closely monitored for any changes.

3. Respiratory status: The patient is currently intubated for airway protection. There is a concern for possible aspiration, and the patient's ABG (arterial blood gas) will be checked to assess respiratory function.

4. Depression: The patient has a history of depression, and appropriate psychosocial"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression and a previous suicide attempt. He was found unconscious at home and was brought to the ICU due to a toxic ingestion of alcohol and multiple medications. The toxic screen confirmed the presence of acetaminophen toxicity. The patient underwent invasive ventilation and was extubated without any complications. His acetaminophen levels have fallen to undetectable levels, and he has been started on a nicotine patch. The patient is still expressing depressed mood and ambivalence about being alive. There are no significant changes in the review of systems, physical examination, or laboratory values.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had respiratory failure requiring invasive ventilation. Although he was successfully extubated and his respiratory status is stable post-extubation, continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure he does not develop any respiratory complications.
2. Acetaminophen Toxicity: The patient initially had detectable levels of acetaminophen toxicity. Although his levels have now fallen to undetectable levels, close monitoring should continue to ensure that there are no delayed complications or recurrence of toxicity.
3. Neck Trauma: The patient had a negative CT scan of the cervical spine, ruling out fractures or displacement. However, careful monitoring should still be done to check for any signs or symptoms of neck trauma.
4. Depression: The patient continues to express depressed mood and ambivalence about being alive. It is important to consider psychiatric"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression and a previous suicide attempt. He was found unconscious at home and brought to the hospital due to a suspected drug overdose. The toxic ingestion included alcohol and multiple medications, with positive results for acetaminophen toxicity. 

The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and is now breathing on his own. His acetaminophen levels have fallen to undetectable levels, and he has been started on a nicotine patch. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, and his respiratory status is good. He has been cleared of any neck trauma, and his chest X-ray shows no infiltrates or signs of pneumonia. 

The patient still expresses depressed mood and ambivalence about being alive. It is recommended to consult with psychiatry regarding possible psychiatric admission following hospitalization. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required invasive ventilation, indicating a potential risk of respiratory failure. However, he has been successfully extubated and is currently stable.
2. Infection: The patient was initially started on antibiotics for possible aspiration pneumonia, but further management was stopped as there were no signs of infection. Regular monitoring is still advised.
3. Depression and Suicide Risk: The patient continues to express depressed mood and suicidal thoughts. Close psychiatric evaluation and monitoring are necessary to prevent any potential self-harm or worsening depression.
4. Drug Overdose: Although the patient's acet"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient presented to the ICU with a chief complaint of drug overdose. They were intubated and placed on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress. The patient was successfully extubated and their acetaminophen levels have fallen to undetectable levels. They were also started on a nicotine patch. The patient had a 1:1 sitter after extubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/61 to 126/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's flow sheet data shows an adequate fluid balance.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they are well-nourished, overweight/obese, with no acute distress. Their cardiovascular and respiratory systems are normal. Abdominal examination shows a soft, non-tender abdomen with present bowel sounds. Extremities reveal absent pulses in both radial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Neurological examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 7.4 thousand/mm³, hematocrit of 38.9%, platelet count of 247 thousand/mm³, creatinine level of 0.7 mg"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of depression and previous suicide attempt. He was found down at home in a vomitus state caused by toxic ingestion of alcohol and multiple medications. The patient's toxic screen was positive for acetaminophen (Tylenol). 

The patient received a loading dose of acetylcysteine (N-acetylcysteine or NAC) to treat acetaminophen toxicity, and his liver function tests (LFTs) are now flat. The patient's acetaminophen level was 16 at presentation and the recommended treatment duration for NAC is 16 hours. 

The patient is also at risk for other toxic ingestions, including prolonged QTc due to multiple SSRIs and antipsychotics ingested. Currently, there are no EKG changes observed. The patient is also at risk for serotonin syndrome, although no symptoms such as tachycardia, myoclonus, or fever have been noted yet. 

The patient experienced respiratory failure and required invasive ventilation. He is now being weaned off Propofol and undergoing a trial of pressure support (PS) ventilation. The patient's chest X-ray is clear without any infiltrates. 

The patient is still wearing a hard neck collar placed by EMS in the field, and a CT scan of the cervical spine was done this morning without being read yet.
