   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o with dementia, urinary incontinence with fevers and back pain,
   presents with septic shock likely due to urosepsis from pyelonephritis
   as per radiographic evidence, clinically well.
   .
   1.. Urosepsis. Pyelonephritis suggested by CT abd and UA. Presistent
   hypotension requiring pressors.  Ran levophed overnight, currently off
   pressors and monitoring blood pressures. Previous CXR neg for
   infection. Non-focal neuro exam suggesting against meningitis.
   - F/u BCx, Ucx shows no growth.
   - continue IV CTX for 2-wk course
   - trend WBC
   - monitor UO with goal of > 0.5 ml/kg/hr
   - hold levophed for now, trend BP if stable > 24h consider floor
   call-out
   - Trend CVP for goal > 8
   - f/u LFTs
   - given mild PVC hold on IVF, allow autodiruesis
   - check CXR for pulmonary source of infection, given urine cx negative
   and still has septic/hypotensive presentation
   - check random cortisol levels
   .
   2. Chest pain- pt had episode of chest pain last night, EKGs were
   obtained; had brief run of wide-complex slow rhythm
   - plan to repeat EKG today
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   3. Altered MS: Has baseline Dementia. Per husband usually oriented.
   Disoriented to time and place. Likely combination of baseline MS,
   infection, and delrium.
   -Avoid sedating meds.
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   4.  ARF: Cr improved from 1.1 to 0.9
   - trend Creatinine
   - no need for ulytes at this time
   .
   5 Constipation: Colace, senna, bisacodyl

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 78-year-old female with dementia and urinary incontinence, presenting with septic shock likely due to urosepsis from pyelonephritis.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/54 mmHg to 132/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for mild chest pain experienced the previous night.
- Physical examination findings include bradycardia, normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, mild crackles in the right lung base, trace edema in both lower extremities, and warm skin without rashes or ecchymoses.
- Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine levels. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and troponin-T are within normal range.
- The patient's current assessment and plan include ongoing management of urosepsis, monitoring blood pressures and urine output, trend white blood cell count, and reassessing for potential pulmonary infection.
- The patient also has baseline dementia, for which frequent reorientation is planned. Additionally, the patient's recent episode of chest pain and altered mental status will be further evaluated"

","Summary:
The patient is admitted to the ICU with a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypotension, but not in shock. They have been receiving norepinephrine infusion to maintain blood pressure. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38.2 degrees Celsius. Their heart rate is within normal range, but their blood pressure is on the lower side with readings between 126/54 mmHg and 74/31 mmHg. The respiratory rate is slightly increased at 22 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturation is at 96% with the aid of a nasal cannula. The central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal limits at 14 mmHg. Fluid balance shows a total input of 8,139 mL and total output of 5,145 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,994 mL. The patient has received blood products totaling 1,770 mL. The ABG results indicate a mixed acid-base disorder. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). Troponin-T levels are within normal range, but other cardiac enzymes are elevated. Blood glucose levels are within normal range. The differential leukocyte count shows an increased percentage of neutrophils. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low calcium (Ca++) levels. The patient's care plan includes treatment for UTI,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 78-year-old individual with a history of dementia, urinary incontinence, fevers, and back pain. They presented with altered mental status, which is suggestive of urosepsis and pyelonephritis. The patient required pressors for persistent hypotension and had a CT abdomen and urine analysis indicating possible infection. The CXR did not reveal any signs of infection, and the neuro exam did not suggest meningitis.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.8°F), a heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/54 to 132/91 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia, and their central venous pressure (CVP) is within the normal range.

The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 8,139 mL and output of 5,145 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 2,994 mL. The patient is receiving norepinephrine at a rate of 0.03 mcg/kg/min and heparin sodium for prophylaxis.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 232 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 109 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia.

The patient's assessment includes urosepsis, pyelonephritis, altered mental status, acute kidney injury (AKI), and baseline dementia. The plan involves continuing intravenous ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, monitoring urine output, titrating norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 65 mmHg, trending CVP, following liver function tests, and avoiding sedating medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:

1. Severe infection: The patient has urosepsis and pyelonephritis, which may lead to worsening of their condition if not properly managed.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest AKI, which can be caused by hypotension, dehydration, or direct kidney infection.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may progress to delirium due to baseline dementia, infection, and medication effects.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and prolonged bed rest.
5. Pressure ulcers: Prolonged pressure on bony prominences can lead to the development of pressure ulcers.
6. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Although the patient is not currently on mechanical ventilation, they are at risk for developing VAP if intubated in the future.
7. Medication side effects: Some medications the patient is receiving may have side effects that could worsen their condition or cause new complications.

These potential complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the patient's well-being."

   Assessment and Plan
   78 y/o with dementia, urinary incontinence with fevers and back pain,
   presented with hypotension, initially thought to be [**1-23**] pyelonephritis,
   but now seems more likely pneumonia.
   .
   1. Community-acquired pneumonia: CXR shows bilateral infiltrates.
   Pyelonephritis suggested by CT, although urine culture negative.
   Presistent hypotension requiring pressors.  Ran levophed overnight,
   currently off pressors and monitoring blood pressures. Previous CXR neg
   for infection. Non-focal neuro exam suggesting against meningitis.
   - F/u BCx, Ucx shows no growth.
   - continue IV CTX for 2-wk course
   - trend WBC
   - monitor UO with goal of > 0.5 ml/kg/hr
   - hold levophed for now, trend BP if stable > 24h consider floor
   call-out
   - Trend CVP for goal > 8
   - f/u LFTs
   - given mild PVC hold on IVF, allow autodiruesis
   - check CXR for pulmonary source of infection, given urine cx negative
   and still has septic/hypotensive presentation
   - check random cortisol levels
   .
   2. Chest pain- pt had episode of chest pain last night, EKGs were
   obtained; had brief run of wide-complex slow rhythm
   - plan to repeat EKG today
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   3. Altered MS: Has baseline Dementia. Per husband usually oriented.
   Disoriented to time and place. Likely combination of baseline MS,
   infection, and delrium.
   -Avoid sedating meds.
   - frequent reorientation
   .
   4.  ARF: Cr improved from 1.1 to 0.9
   - trend Creatinine
   - no need for ulytes at this time

","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of dementia, urinary incontinence, and fever. She presented with hypotension and was initially thought to have pyelonephritis but is now more likely to have pneumonia. The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral infiltrates consistent with community-acquired pneumonia. The urine culture is negative, but there are concerns about a pulmonary source of infection given the septic and hypotensive presentation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 105/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on prophylactic heparin and has been started on oral levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 242 K/uL, blood glucose level of 145 mg/dL, and electrolyte levels within normal ranges. The creatinine level has improved from 1.1 to 0.9, indicating improvement in renal function.

The patient's physical examination reveals bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, indicating possible lung infection. There is no evidence of edema in the extremities. The patient's neurological examination shows disorientation to time and place, likely due to a combination"

","The patient is a 78-year-old woman with a history of dementia and urinary incontinence, presenting with fevers and back pain. She initially showed signs of hypotension and was suspected to have pyelonephritis, but further evaluation suggests it is more likely to be pneumonia. The patient's current condition includes sepsis/community-acquired pneumonia, chest pain, altered mental status, and constipation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms of fever, hypotension, and positive blood cultures indicate an ongoing infection, which can progress to sepsis if not appropriately managed.
2. Pneumonia: The worsening of right lower lobe opacity and the initiation of Levofloxacin suggest the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential respiratory failure.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be attributed to a combination of baseline dementia, infection, and delirium. If not addressed, delirium may worsen, leading to increased confusion, agitation, and potential falls or self-harm.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving prophylactic UF heparin for DVT prevention, there is still a risk of developing DVT, especially considering her prolonged immobility in the ICU.
5. Medication-related complications: The patient is on multiple medications, including antibiotics,"

   - hold levophed for now, trend BP if stable > 24h consider floor
   call-out
   - Trend CVP for goal > 8
   - f/u LFTs
   - given mild PVC hold on IVF, allow autodiruesis
   - check CXR for pulmonary source of infection, given urine cx negative
   and still has septic/hypotensive presentation
   - check random cortisol levels
   .
   2. Chest pain- pt had episode of chest pain last night, EKGs were
   obtained; had brief run of wide-complex slow rhythm
   - plan to repeat EKG today
   - cycle cardiac enzymes
   3. Altered MS: Has baseline Dementia. Per husband usually oriented.
   Disoriented to time and place. Likely combination of baseline MS,
   infection, and delrium.
   -Avoid sedating meds.
   - frequent reorientation

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of dementia, urinary incontinence, and back pain. She presented with septic shock likely due to urosepsis from pyelonephritis, as per radiographic evidence. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 61 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 105/57 to 117/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's cardiovascular status shows bradycardia and normal S1 and S2 without murmurs. The respiratory examination reveals improved findings compared to the previous exam, with mild crackles in the right lower lung base. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities and warm skin without rashes or ecchymoses. Neurological examination shows attentiveness and the ability to follow simple commands, but gait assessment was not performed.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 24200/uL, normal hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated platelet count, and normal kidney function. Troponin-T levels are below the detection limit. Other lab values are within normal range, except for an elevated creatinine level that has improved from 1.1 to 0.9.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with septic shock presumptively from a urinary source. The note mentions that the patient is critically ill and experiencing several medical complications.

1. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis, which is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure if not treated promptly and effectively.

2. Hypotension: The patient previously had hypotension, which has now resolved. However, the patient is still at risk for further episodes of low blood pressure due to sepsis.

3. Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient is showing signs of a left-sided chest pain and a CXR with infiltrate, indicating a possible pneumonia. This requires close monitoring and appropriate treatment.

4. Fluid balance: The patient's fluid balance is currently euvolemic, meaning that their fluid intake and output are in balance. However, there is a concern for maintaining this balance and monitoring intake and output.

5. Mental status: The patient's mental status needs to be confirmed with family as there are concerns about their baseline mental status.

6. Nutritional support: The patient is currently receiving nutritional support through the gastrointestinal tract (PO).

7. Lines and prophylaxis: The patient has multiple lines, including an 18-gauge line and a multi-lumen line. The patient is also receiving prophylactic measures such as DVT prevention, stress ulcer prevention, and VAP prevention.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old woman with septic shock, likely originating from a urinary source. She has shown clinical improvement but still requires intensive care support. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has been low, indicating septic shock. Although it has resolved and the patient is off vasopressors, close monitoring of blood pressure is necessary to ensure it remains stable.

2. Pulmonary infiltrate: The patient has developed left-sided chest pain and a CXR showing an evolving left retrocardiac infiltrate and pleural effusion. This raises concern for pneumonia, which can worsen respiratory function and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

3. Fluid balance: The patient is euvolemic, but careful monitoring of intake and output is required to maintain fluid balance and prevent complications such as fluid overload or dehydration.

4. Mental status: The patient's mental status needs to be confirmed with family due to concerns about delirium or altered mental status, which can be common in critically ill patients.

5. Nutritional support: Encouraging oral intake (PO) is recommended, but the patient may require additional nutritional support depending on her condition.

Overall, close monitoring and management of these potential complications are crucial for the patient's recovery in the ICU."
