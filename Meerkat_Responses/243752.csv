   # ?GI bleeding: Concern for upper GI bleed in patient with cirrhosis
   and portal hypertension with evidence of [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on [**2160-8-29**]
   EGD, however no evidence of active bleeding on EGD. Likely had old
   bleed. Other possible sources include PUD (altough on max dose PPI as
   outpatient) or gastritis/esophagitis. Contribting factor is likely
   underlying coagulapathy and thrombocytopenia from liver disease.
   Octreotide DCd given no variceal bleed on EGD.No further bleeding since
   no BM or emesis.
   - PPI IV bid
   - Cipro IV for SBP ppx

   - Hold nadolol until clear that is hemodynamically stable
   - Hepatology following
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus, most likely related to intravascular volume
   depletion due to emesis and poor PO intake and possibly GI bleeding;
   notably he was partially IVF responsive in the ED. Although denies EtOH
   use, per Hepatology there has been concern in past for indiscretion and
   electrolyte abnormalities on admission c/w alcohol use. Also consider
   infection since now has fever in patient with h/o ascites and reports
   of intermittent abdominal pain and subjective fevers. On nadolol as
   outpatient but no recent dose change to suggest beta-blocker
   withdrawal. Also consider PE especially given h/o portal thrombosis,
   however no other pulmonary symptoms or evidence DVT. Other possible
   etiology is methamphetamine use given + urine tox but pt denies.
   - Hold nadolol per above

   # Syncope: Differential includes vasovagal, orthostatic hypoperfusion,
   cardiogenic arrythmia, or seizure. Sinus tach supports intravascular
   volume depletion as likely cause. No prior h/o cardiac disease that
   would suggest malignant arrythmia and no current chest discomfort. No
   prior h/o seizure disorder or other CNS disease.

   # Chronic emesis: Consider GERD as etiology although on PPI
   chronically, or gastroparesis but no other known risk factors. EGD in
   past has not revealed another potential etiology.
   - Check A1c
   - Consider gastric empyting study to eval source of chronic emesis
   - Continue high dose PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis, who presented with tachycardia and suspected gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. He has a background of portal hypertension and previous variceal bleeding. The patient denies any recent use of methamphetamine, but urine toxicology is positive for methamphetamines. His fever started at 3:00 AM, and he has had an episode of old blood in his stomach, with no active bleeding seen on endoscopy. Octreotide was discontinued as there was no variceal bleed observed. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a fever of 101.4°F, tachycardia, and hypotension. He has diffuse abdominal pain, strongest under the left rib, worse with deep breathing. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and positive serum tox screen for methamphetamines. He also has an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine level. Imaging studies, such as a TTE and RUQ US, are pending. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of cirrhosis and portal hypertension, which are risk factors for variceal bleeding. Although no active bleeding was seen on EGD, the presence of old blood in the stomach suggests a"

   # ?GI bleeding: Concern for upper GI bleed in patient with cirrhosis
   and portal hypertension with evidence of [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on [**2160-8-29**]
   EGD, however no evidence at that time of gastric or esophageal varices.
   Other possible sources include PUD (altough on max dose PPI as
   outpatient) or gastritis/esophagitis. Contribting factor is likely
   underlying coagulapathy and thrombocytopenia from liver disease.
   - PPI IV bid
   - Octreotide gtt
   - Cipro IV
   - EGD today to eval for source
   - Large bore PIV x2
   - T&X 2 units
   - Hct Q6H until demonstrate stability, transfuse <24
   - Keep Plt>50, INR<1.5
   - Hold nadolol until clear that is hemodynamically stable
   - Hepatology following
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus, most likely related to intravascular volume
   depletion due to emesis and poor PO intake and possibly GI bleeding;
   notably he was IVF responsive in the ED. Although denies EtOH use, per
   Hepatology there has been concern in past for indiscretion. Also
   consider infection in patient with h/o ascites and reports of
   intermittent abdominal pain and subjective fevers. On nadolol as
   outpatient but no recent dose change to suggest beta-blocker
   withdrawal. Also consider PE especially given h/o portal thrombosis,
   however no other pulmonary symptoms or evidence DVT.
   - Hold nadolol per above
   - NS resuscitation
   - Ativan prn CIWA scale >8
   - Telemetry
   - Liver U/S with dopplers per liver service
   - If ascites present, consider diagnostic para
   - Surveillance blood cultures, and U/A and culture
   - Cipro IV per above pending further data
   .
   # Syncope: Differential includes vasovagal, orthostatic hypoperfusion,
   cardiogenic arrythmia, or seizure. Sinus tach supports intravascular
   volume depletion as likely cause. No prior h/o cardiac disease that
   would suggest malignant arrythmia and no current chest discomfort. No
   prior h/o seizure disorder or other CNS disease.
   - Orthostatics
   - Echo to eval valves, ?WMA
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, serial ECGs
   - Check TSH, A1c, tox screens
   .
   # Chronic emesis: Consider GERD as etiology although on PPI
   chronically, or gastroparesis but no other known risk factors. EGD in
   past has not revealed another potential etiology.
   - Check A1c
   - Consider gastric empyting study to eval source of chronic emesis
   - Continue high dose PPI
   - Restart sucralfate post-EGD

   # Cirrhosis:  Due to EtOH. Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6046**]. Has history of

","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of EtOH cirrhosis, GI bleeding, and chronic left abdominal pain. He presents with tachycardia and possible GI bleeding, likely secondary to variceal banding. The patient has evidence of coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. He is currently receiving PPI IV bid, Cipro IV for SBP prophylaxis, large bore PIV x2, T&X 2 units, and restarted on nadolol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleeding: The patient has a history of GI bleeding and continues to have melena. Further bleeding could occur due to underlying coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of EtOH cirrhosis and minimal ascites. Hepatic encephalopathy may develop if the patient's liver function deteriorates.
3. Hepatic hydrothorax: Given the patient's history of EtOH cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis, there is a risk of developing hepatic hydrothorax.
4. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient is on Cipro IV for SBP prophylaxis, indicating an increased risk for SBP.
5. Hepatorenal syndrome: With worsening liver function, the patient may develop hepatorenal syndrome.

   Assessment and Plan
   49M h/o EtOH cirrhosis, GI bleeding s/p variceal banding presents with
   tachycardia and ?GI bleeding.
   .
   # ?GI bleeding: Concern for upper GI bleed in patient with cirrhosis
   and portal hypertension with evidence of [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear on [**2160-8-29**]
   EGD, however no evidence of active bleeding on EGD. Likely had old
   bleed. Other possible sources include PUD (altough on max dose PPI as
   outpatient) or gastritis/esophagitis. Contribting factor is likely
   underlying coagulapathy and thrombocytopenia from liver disease.
   Octreotide DCd given no variceal bleed on EGD.No further bleeding since
   no BM or emesis.
   - PPI IV bid
   - Cipro IV for SBP ppx
   - F/U hepatology recs
   - Large bore PIV x2
   - T&X 2 units
   - Hct Q6H until demonstrate stability, transfuse <25
   - Keep Plt>50, INR<1.5 to avoid further bleeding
   - Hold nadolol until clear that is hemodynamically stable
   - Hepatology following
   .
   # Tachycardia: Sinus, most likely related to intravascular volume
   depletion due to emesis and poor PO intake and possibly GI bleeding;
   notably he was partially IVF responsive in the ED. Although denies EtOH
   use, per Hepatology there has been concern in past for indiscretion and
   electrolyte abnormalities on admission c/w alcohol use. Also consider
   infection since now has fever in patient with h/o ascites and reports
   of intermittent abdominal pain and subjective fevers. On nadolol as
   outpatient but no recent dose change to suggest beta-blocker
   withdrawal. Also consider PE especially given h/o portal thrombosis,
   however no other pulmonary symptoms or evidence DVT. Other possible
   etiology is methamphetamine use given + urine tox but pt denies.
   - Hold nadolol per above
   - NS resuscitationwill bolus prn
   - Ativan prn CIWA scale >8, has not been [**Doctor Last Name 93**] overnight but will
   give ativan since possible component of alcohol withdrawal
   - Telemetry
   - Liver U/S with dopplers per liver service
   - If ascites present, consider diagnostic para
   - F/U blood cultures, and U/A and culture
   - Cipro IV per above pending further data
   .
   Fever: ? infectious vs. 2/2 blood transfusion reaction since spiked at
   end of transfusion. Only localizing symptoms include abdominal pain,
   concern for SBP although minimal tenderness on exam. Will follow up RUQ
   US to aseess for ascities, ? tap.  CXR was normal. UA normal
   -          F/U RUQ uS, ? para
   -          FU blood and urine cx
   -          Follow fever curve
   .
   # Syncope: Differential includes vasovagal, orthostatic hypoperfusion,
   cardiogenic arrythmia, or seizure. Sinus tach supports intravascular
   volume depletion as likely cause. No prior h/o cardiac disease that
   would suggest malignant arrythmia and no current chest discomfort. No
   prior h/o seizure disorder or other CNS disease.
   - Orthostatics
   - Echo to eval valves, ?WMA
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, serial ECGs
   - Check TSH, A1c, tox screens
   - EP to see in Sunday
   .
   # Chronic emesis: Consider GERD as etiology although on PPI
   chronically, or gastroparesis but no other known risk factors. EGD in
   past has not revealed another potential etiology.
   - Check A1c
   - Consider gastric empyting study to eval source of chronic emesis
   - Continue high dose PPI
   - Restart sucralfate post-EGD
   .
   # Cirrhosis:  Due to EtOH. Patient of Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6046**]. Has history of
   large ascites requiring [**Doctor First Name **]; also portal vein thrombosis. No current
   e/o obvious ascites. Now off EtOH. Had recent liver U/S with patent
   vessels.
   - Appreciate liver recs
   - Cipro per above
   - Hold nadolol, lactulose, sucralfate for now
   - Encourage Etoh abstinence
   - Continue home pancreatic enzymes
   .
   # Depression: Continue home citalopram.
   .
   # FEN: Advance to clears, IVF bolus prn tachycardia, Replete lytes prn
   and recheck in pm
   # Ppx: Pneumoboots, [**Hospital1 **] PPI.
   # Access: PIV x2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of ethanol (EtOH) cirrhosis and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient presents with tachycardia and possible GI bleeding. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) showed no evidence of active bleeding but there was evidence of an [**Doctor First Name **] tear from a previous bleeding episode. The patient has received octreotide and is currently stable without further bleeding.

The patient also has a history of chronic emesis, which may be due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastroparesis. An EGD has not revealed any other potential etiology. The patient is currently on high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and sucralfate has been restarted post-EGD.

Additionally, the patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to EtOH use. He has had large ascites requiring paracentesis and portal vein thrombosis. There is no current evidence of ascites. The patient's liver function tests are within normal limits and he had a recent liver ultrasound (U/S) with patent vessels.

The patient also has a history of depression and is currently on home citalopram.

The patient's current vitals show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 135/62 mmHg,"
