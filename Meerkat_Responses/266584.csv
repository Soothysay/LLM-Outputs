   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma who presents s/p L neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and
   myocutaneous pectoral flap, who was re-intubated post operatively for
   respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory/Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient is currently intubated,
   last ABG was 7.33/47/93/26 on Vent settings 600/16/10/100%FiO2
   saturating 98%.  Patient is stable, but there is concern that patient
   may have had aspiration event.  CXR shows RLL opacity that may be
   evolving aspiration pneumonia.  Patient is currently afebrile and
   hemodynamically stable.  For now, will monitor patient and attempt to
   wean FiO2.
   - Continue current vent setting
   - Attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated
   - Hold on antibiotics for now.
   .
   #. s/p thyroidectomy:  Patient is at risk for hypocalcemia.  Currently
   hypocalcemic at 1.01.
   - Monitor free Calcium
   .
   #. s/p L myocutaneous flap:  Wound is closed, with six JP drains in
   place.  Recommendation is to keep wound clensed, but not dressed for
   now.  Of note, patient had a prior R thigh MSSA abcess earlier this
   month.
   - Start Cefazolin 1g q8hrs
   .
   #. Hypertension: SBPs .  Patient is on lisinopril at home.  Given that
   patient is currently intubated, and concerned about patient becoming
   septic, will hold on restarting medications.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, who underwent left neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and myocutaneous pectoral flap. The patient was reintubated post-operatively due to respiratory distress.

1. Respiratory/Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient is currently intubated and showing signs of potential aspiration pneumonia. The CXR reveals a right lower lobe opacity that may indicate evolving aspiration pneumonia. However, the patient is currently stable, afebrile, and hemodynamically stable. The plan is to monitor the patient closely and attempt to wean FiO2 as tolerated while continuing the current ventilator settings. No antibiotics have been started yet.

2. s/p thyroidectomy: The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia following thyroidectomy. The patient's free calcium level is currently low at 1.01. Calcium gluconate 4g IV has been administered, and the patient's free calcium levels will be closely monitored.

3. s/p L myocutaneous flap: The patient's wound is closed with six JP drains in place. The recommendation is to keep the wound clean but not dressed for now. It is noted that the patient had a prior right thigh MSSA abscess earlier this month. Therefore, Cefazolin 1g q8hrs has been started to prevent any potential wound infection.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 y/o male with a history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid
   carcinoma who presents s/p L neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and
   myocutaneous pectoral flap, who was re-intubated post operatively for
   respiratory distress.
   #. Respiratory failure:  Patient currently tolerating pressure support
   and has gag reflex.  Patient does have brown sputum that is concerning
   for an aspiration pneumonia.  Patient also has significant surgical
   wound on his chest that may limit patient
s ventilation.  Patient has
   gag reflex present.
   -          Place patient back on AC vent settings
   -          Send Sputum specimen
   -          Attempt to replace OG tube
   # Aspiration Pneumonia:  Patient is currently intubated, patient had
   witnessed aspiration event last night.  Patient has elevated WBC, has
   low grade temps.  [**Month (only) 11**] be attributed to being post op, but in light of
   witnessed aspiration event, patient is now being treated with
   levo/flagyl.
   - Repeat CXR as film this AM was poor
   - Continue Levo/Flagyl
   - Send Sputum Cx
   .
   #. s/p thyroidectomy:  Patient is at risk for hypocalcemia.  Currently
   hypocalcemic at 1.04.
   -          Monitor free Calcium, mg, phos q8hrs
   -          Replete Calcium IV
   .
   #. s/p L myocutaneous flap:  Wound is closed, with six JP drains in
   place.  Recommendation is to keep wound clensed, but not dressed for
   now.  Of note, patient had a prior R thigh MSSA abcess earlier this
   month.
   - Continue Cefazolin 1g q8hrs
   .
   #. Hypertension: SBPs .  Patient is on lisinopril at home.  Given that
   patient is currently intubated, and concerned about patient becoming
   septic, will hold on restarting medications.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma who underwent a left neck dissection, total thyroidectomy, and myocutaneous pectoral flap. He presented with respiratory distress post-operatively and required reintubation.

The patient is currently tolerating pressure support and has a gag reflex present. However, there are concerns for aspiration pneumonia due to brown sputum and a witnessed aspiration event last night. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, and he has low-grade temperatures, which may be attributed to being post-operative but could also indicate an infection.

The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia post-thyroidectomy and has a current free calcium level of 1.04. Monitoring of free calcium and magnesium levels is recommended, along with repletion of calcium IV if necessary.

The patient's surgical wound from the myocutaneous flap is closed, with six JP drains in place. There is a concern for wound infection given the patient's history of a right thigh MSSA abscess earlier this month. Continuing cefazolin is recommended.

The patient's blood pressure is being monitored, and medications for hypertension are being held due to concerns about potential sepsis.

The patient has diabetes type II, and home metformin is being held. SSI (superficial subcutaneous infection) is being continued.

The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, and has two 18-gauge peripheral intravenous lines in place.

Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, bowel regimen, pain management, and code status have been addressed.

The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU, pending respiratory improvement."

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma who underwent a left neck dissection and is currently in the ICU. He was reintubated for respiratory distress but has since been extubated. The patient has been receiving various medications and treatments, including antibiotics, pain management, and prophylactic measures for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. He also has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and recent aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient may still be at risk for respiratory failure due to the previous aspiration pneumonitis and potential fluid overload.
2. Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis: Although the patient has been extubated, he still has thick secretions, which increases the risk of further aspiration and infection.
3. Hypocalcemia: The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia following thyroidectomy with parathyroidectomy. Monitoring free calcium levels and repletion is recommended.
4. Wound infection: The patient had a prior MSSA abscess in the right thigh, and there is a concern for wound infection given his immunocompromised state.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings are elevated, and it is important to closely monitor and manage his hypertension.
6. Diabetes, type II: Holding home metformin and continuing SSI is advised, but close monitoring of blood glucose"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a medical history of metastatic melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma. He presented post-operatively for respiratory distress and was reintubated. Currently, the patient is on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. He has brown sputum, which raises concern for aspiration pneumonia. There is also a significant surgical wound on his chest that may limit ventilation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is tolerating pressure support and has a gag reflex. However, there is brown sputum indicating a possible aspiration pneumonia, and the surgical wound on his chest may restrict ventilation.
   - Place the patient back on AC vent settings
   - Send sputum specimen
   - Attempt to replace OG tube

2. Aspiration Pneumonia: The patient had a witnessed aspiration event last night, and his WBC count is elevated. He has low-grade fever. In light of the witnessed aspiration event, the patient is being treated with levo/flagyl.
   - Repeat CXR as the film this morning was poor
   - Continue Levo/Flagyl
   - Send sputum culture

3. Post-thyroidectomy: The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia. Currently, his calcium level is 1.04.

   Assessment and Plan
   72 yo male with THYROID CANCER-now s/p radical neck dissection with
   procedure complicated by significant aspiration pneumonitis and
   requiring re-intubation urgently.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Patient with current barriers to extubation of
   secretion volume and inability to maintain signfiicant capacity for
   cough and secretion clearance.  He has relatively minimal evolution of
   significant new focal consolidation or infiltrate to suggest
   significant new pneumonia but he does have asymetric lung volumes
   right<left.  He has favorable RSBI and tolerance of SBT x45 minutes.
   -Will return to PSV at this time
   -Will await return to full alertness with propofol decrease to
   facilitate extubation
   -Check Abg prior to return to full ventilatory support
   -Secretions have decreased
   -Levo/Flagyl to continue although patient has not evolved
   -Will discuss with ENT prior to extubation as patient has cuff leak and
   gag at this time

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid carcinoma who underwent a left neck dissection. He presented with respiratory distress and was reintubated but has now been extubated again. 

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, hypocalcemia, postoperative wound management, hypertension, type II diabetes, and feeding intolerance. 

For the respiratory failure, the patient is still requiring supplemental oxygen and may have fluid overload or aspiration pneumonitis. He should continue to use an incentive spirometer and wean off the oxygen.

Regarding the aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis, the patient has been receiving antibiotics but no infiltrate on chest X-ray was noted. There are 4+ Gram-negative rods in the sputum, which may represent colonization. Consider discontinuing Levofloxacin and Flagyl, and follow up with sputum culture.

The patient is at risk for hypocalcemia due to thyroidectomy with parathyroidectomy. Monitor free calcium, magnesium, and phosphate every 8 hours and replete calcium IV.

The surgical wound is closed with six JP drains in place. The patient had a prior right thigh methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus abscess earlier this month. Continue Cefazolin 1g q8hrs per ENT.

The patient's hypertension should be monitored, and medications should be held"

","Summary:
- The patient is a 72-year-old individual with metastatic melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer who underwent total thyroidectomy.
- Post-operative course was complicated by aspiration and post-extubation events, requiring re-intubation.
- The patient was extubated yesterday and initially remained stable on 2 liters of nasal cannula (NC) oxygen.
- Currently, the patient is stable but has developed hypernatremia, which needs to be addressed by repleting free water with D5W.
- The patient also has an aspiration pneumonitis and facial nerve deficit, likely due to surgical removal of the parotid gland.
- The patient's code status is full code, and they are awaiting a surgical floor bed for disposition.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient's recent extubation and history of aspiration event may increase the risk of further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
