   Assessment and Plan
   59 M with htn, hyperlipidemia, CM, CAD, CHF, CRI, h/o stroke and
   psychiatric issues presents for follow up.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness: Most likely hypoperfusion due to ischemic
   heart failure, though other possibilities include acute CVA, vaso vagal
   episode and hypoxia due to respiratory failure.  Seizure unlikely.
   - Evaluate cardiac function as below.
   - Lower sedation in AM to fully assess mental status.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Multiple prior MIs, with rising troponins after
   diaphoresis and loss of consciousness, without ECG changes of ischemia,
   most consistent with NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath did not show any
   intervenable lesions.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor,
   Imdur and lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Went to cardiac cath for diagnosis, acute thrombus found but will be
   medically  managed. No stent placed.
   - Given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily.
   - On bivalirudin gtt because of a heparin allergy. Will continue gtt
   for 48hrs.
   - Given 600mg Plavix load, to be continued on 75mg daily.
   - Restart beta blocker at lower dose and titrate up.
   - Restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - ?CABG candidacy, will discuss further w/ attendings
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial
   ischemia and hypertensive urgency.  Lungs sound improved this morning
   with lower BPs and anticoagulation.  Lung exam much improved this
   morning and is requiring less aggressive vent settings.
   - Diuresis slow overnight, but has improved with higher BPs. I/O goal
   of -500cc today. Will recheck Cr this afternoon.
   - Tolerating lower vent settings, will continue to wean while following
   ABGs.
   - If tolerates lower PEEP, can wean to pressure support ventilation.
   - Follow ARDS protocol vent settings.
   - Follow serial ABGs. ? A line placement.
   - Obtain sputum cultures
   - Received one dose of broad spectrum abx in CCU, now holding b/c there
   are not signs of infection.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of 20%, mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis and regional
   akinesis on TEE.  BNP is lower than on previous admissions, suggesting
   that he may not have acutely elevated atrial pressures. Overall
   concerning for ischemic worsening of already poor systolic function.
   - goal -500cc to 1L today. Continue Lasix gtt.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and daily weights.
   .
   # RHYTHM: In sinus tachycardia. Will need beta-blocker for prevention
   of post-MI arrhythmias.
   .
   # DM.  Followed by [**Last Name (un) 294**], with poor compliance, though patient was
   apparently still taking his insulin at home.
   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c
   .
   # Hypertension.  Slightly hypotensive overnight in the setting of
   NSTEMI.  Now improving, and will most likely become hypertensive soon.
   - restart metoprolol on return from cath.  Restart Imdur this morning.
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - hold amlodipine in peri MI setting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: unclear level of control, was not taking high-dose
   statin prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   - Check HDL, LDL, total cholesterol.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure: Arrived in hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Exact etiology unclear but may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of cardiac ischemia.  No e/o massive PE or infection to explain
   large A-a gradient.  Started on ARDS protocol.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   - Diurese as able with Lasix gtt
   - Daily breathing trials, RSBI, VAP bundle
   - Monitor ABGs, check upon arrival to CCU
   .
   # CRI: Cr bumped up in the setting of diuresis and CTA dye load, now
   2.6 from baseline of 1.6.
   - Urine lytes, culture
   - Mucomyst PO x 2 doses
   - diurese for now, monitor Cr closely
   - renally dose medications.
   .
   #  Respiratory Acidosis: Due to hypoventilation in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Improving with ventilation.
   - Trend ABGs, ? A-line
   .
   #  +Anion Gap Metabolic Acidsosis.  Lactic Acidosis.
   - Resolved upon admission to CCU, monitor
   .
   #  Elevated Troponin: Most likely due to NSTEMI and acute plaque
   rupture.  Other possibilities include hypertensive emergency or
   decompensated CHF.  Continue to trend.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has been afebrile and does not report any
   recent sick contacts per family.  Leucocytosis likely a stress response
   to NSTEMI, as it is now trending down.
   - Hold antibiotics unless further evidence of PNA
   - Trend leukocytosis; culture as symptoms localize
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive.
   - Trend, improved on repeat labs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely fluid overload given flash pulmonary edema,
   poor Lasix compliance and LE edema.
   - Diurese as above, trend
   - Send urine lytes, FeUrea
   .

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chronic renal insufficiency, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and a history of stroke. He presents for follow-up and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

24-hour events:
- An ECHO showed mildly dilated left ventricle (LV) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, global hypokinesis, apex scarred and diskinetic. Mild pulmonary artery hypertension.
- Cardiac catheterization showed severe three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) and possible acute distal occlusion of the omohyoid branch (OMB2), but with a small territory of occlusion. Possible continued infarction. No stent was placed. A previously stented left anterior descending artery (LAD) is now occluded, as well as the first diagonal branch with 80% occlusion, and the circumflex artery with 70% occlusion. Right collaterals are supplying the left side.
- Continued on bivalirudin drip given possible continued infarction and possible heparin allergy.
- Obtained two peripheral IVs.
- Pulled groin line.
- At 18:21, an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH 7.49. Repeated ABG.
- At 2:30 AM, ABG results were 7.43/37/132"

   diaphoresis and loss of consciousness, without ECG changes of ischemia,
   most consistent with NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath did not show any
   intervenable lesions.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor,
   Imdur and lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Going to cardiac cath for diagnosis and angioplasty of possible
   occlusion.
   - Given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily.

   # PUMP: EF of 20%, mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis and regional
   akinesis on TEE.  BNP is lower than on previous admissions, suggesting
   that he may not have acutely elevated atrial pressures. Overall
   concerning for ischemic worsening of already poor systolic function.
   - Consider repeat echo in two days for improvement after possible
   revascularization and diuresis.
   - goal -1L today. Continue Lasix gtt.

   # Hypertension.  Slightly hypotensive overnight in the setting of
   NSTEMI.  Now improving, and will most likely become hypertensive soon.
   - restart metoprolol on return from cath.  Restart Imdur this morning.
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - hold amlodipine in peri MI setting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: unclear level of control, was not taking high-dose
   statin prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   - Check HDL, LDL, total cholesterol.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure: Arrived in hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Exact etiology unclear but may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of cardiac ischemia.  No e/o massive PE or infection to explain
   large A-a gradient.  Started on ARDS protocol.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   - Diurese as able with Lasix gtt
   - Daily breathing trials, RSBI, VAP bundle
   - Monitor ABGs, check upon arrival to CCU

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), history of stroke, and psychiatric issues. The patient presented for follow-up and was found to have loss of consciousness, dyspnea, and chest pain.

The patient underwent cardiac catheterization, which showed severe three-vessel CAD and possible distal occlusion of the omohyoid branch of the second diagonal artery (OMB2), with a small territory of occlusion. The patient was started on bivalirudin drip due to a heparin allergy and given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily. The patient also received a 600mg Plavix load, to be continued on 75mg daily. Beta-blockers were restarted at a lower dose and titrated up, and lisinopril was restarted as tolerated.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/73 to 128/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 60%. The patient's cardiac rhythm is in sinus tachycardia, and the physical examination shows a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line, with distant heart sounds. There are slight central rhochi in the lungs, but overall they are clear. The abdomen is soft and slightly distended without hepatosplenomegaly or abdominal bruits. There are no femoral bruits, and the catheter and femoral line sites are clean and dry. A small, dry 2cm ulcer is present on the right big toe.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient's BUN and creatinine levels are elevated, suggesting renal dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but there are no signs of infection. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for hyponatremia.

The patient's respiratory status has improved with mechanical ventilation and diuretic therapy. The patient is expected to continue on mechanical ventilation and diuretic therapy. The plan is to wean the ventilator while following arterial blood gas (ABG) trends. Sputum cultures will be obtained, and the patient will be monitored closely for any signs of infection.

The patient's cardiac function is poor, with an ejection fraction (EF) of 20%, mild left ventricular (LV) dilation, global hypokinesis, and regional akinesis on transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Repeat echo in two days for improvement after possible revascularization and diuretic therapy"

   59 M with htn, hyperlipidemia, CM, CAD, CHF, CRI, h/o stroke and
   psychiatric issues presents for follow up.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness: Unclear etiology of his LOC. Most likely
   hypoperfusion due to ischemic heart failure, though other possibilities
   include acute CVA, vaso vagal episode and hypoxia due to respiratory
   failure.  Seizure unlikely.  The N/C head CT did not show an acute
   process and he did not have the quick recovery expected for a vagal
   episode (though patient was intubated).
   - Lower sedation in AM to fully assess mental status.
   - Evaluate cardiac function as below.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema due to ischemic heart failure
   possibly due to acute myocardial infarction.  Has had multiple
   admissions in the past with pulmonary edema in the setting of
   hypertensive urgency due to medication non-compliance.  Another
   possibility is community acquired pneumonia, although unlikely to
   present in such rapid fashion.  His CXR is most concerning for
   pulmonary edema vs ARDS.
   - Goal diuresis of -1L overnight.  Will most likely require Lasix gtt.
   - Wean from ventilator as tolerated.
   - Follow ARDS protocol vent settings.
   - Follow serial ABGs
   - Obtain sputum cultures
   - Start antibiotics pending other evidence of pneumonia.

   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c
   .
   # Hypertension.  On nitro infusion in ED for management of hypertensive
   emergency.  Now normotensive.  Difficult to control hypertension at
   baseline.
   - restart metoprolol on return from cath.  Continue home Imdur.
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - hold amlodipine in peri MI setting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: unclear level of control, was not taking high-dose
   statin prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   - Check HDL, LDL, total cholesterol.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure: Arrived in hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Exact etiology unclear but may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of cardiac ischemia.  No e/o massive PE or infection to explain
   large A-a gradient.  Started on ARDS protocol.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   - Diurese as able with Lasix gtt

   Assessment and Plan
   59 M with htn, hyperlipidemia, CM, CAD, CHF, CRI, h/o stroke and
   psychiatric issues presents for follow up.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness: Most likely hypoperfusion due to ischemic
   heart failure, though other possibilities include acute CVA, vaso vagal
   episode and hypoxia due to respiratory failure.  Seizure unlikely.
   - Evaluate cardiac function as below.
   - Lower sedation in AM to fully assess mental status.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Multiple prior MIs, with rising troponins after
   diaphoresis and loss of consciousness, without ECG changes of ischemia,
   most consistent with NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath did not show any
   intervenable lesions.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor,
   Imdur and lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Went to cardiac cath for diagnosis, acute thrombus found but will be
   medically  managed. No stent placed.
   - Given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily.
   - On bivalirudin gtt because of a heparin allergy. Will continue gtt
   for 48hrs.
   - Given 600mg Plavix load, to be continued on 75mg daily.
   - Restart beta blocker at lower dose and titrate up.
   - Restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - ?CABG candidacy, will discuss further w/ attendings
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial
   ischemia and hypertensive urgency.  Lungs sound improved this morning
   with lower BPs and anticoagulation.  Lung exam much improved this
   morning and is requiring less aggressive vent settings.
   - Diuresis slow overnight, but has improved with higher BPs. I/O goal
   of -500cc today. Will recheck Cr this afternoon.
   - Tolerating lower vent settings, will continue to wean while following
   ABGs.
   - If tolerates lower PEEP, can wean to pressure support ventilation.
   - Follow ARDS protocol vent settings.
   - Follow serial ABGs. ? A line placement.
   - Obtain sputum cultures
   - Received one dose of broad spectrum abx in CCU, now holding b/c there
   are not signs of infection.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of 20%, mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis and regional
   akinesis on TEE.  BNP is lower than on previous admissions, suggesting
   that he may not have acutely elevated atrial pressures. Overall
   concerning for ischemic worsening of already poor systolic function.
   - goal -500cc to 1L today. Continue Lasix gtt.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and daily weights.
   .
   # RHYTHM: In sinus tachycardia. Will need beta-blocker for prevention
   of post-MI arrhythmias.
   .
   # DM.  Followed by [**Last Name (un) 294**], with poor compliance, though patient was
   apparently still taking his insulin at home.
   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c
   .
   # Hypertension.  Slightly hypotensive overnight in the setting of
   NSTEMI.  Now improving, and will most likely become hypertensive soon.
   - restart metoprolol on return from cath.  Restart Imdur this morning.
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - hold amlodipine in peri MI setting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: unclear level of control, was not taking high-dose
   statin prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   - Check HDL, LDL, total cholesterol.
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure: Arrived in hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Exact etiology unclear but may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of cardiac ischemia.  No e/o massive PE or infection to explain
   large A-a gradient.  Started on ARDS protocol.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   - Diurese as able with Lasix gtt
   - Daily breathing trials, RSBI, VAP bundle
   - Monitor ABGs, check upon arrival to CCU
   .
   # CRI: Cr bumped up in the setting of diuresis and CTA dye load, now
   2.6 from baseline of 1.6.
   - Urine lytes, culture
   - Mucomyst PO x 2 doses
   - diurese for now, monitor Cr closely
   - renally dose medications.
   .
   #  Respiratory Acidosis: Due to hypoventilation in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Improving with ventilation.
   - Trend ABGs, ? A-line
   .
   #  +Anion Gap Metabolic Acidsosis.  Lactic Acidosis.
   - Resolved upon admission to CCU, monitor
   .
   #  Elevated Troponin: Most likely due to NSTEMI and acute plaque
   rupture.  Other possibilities include hypertensive emergency or
   decompensated CHF.  Continue to trend.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has been afebrile and does not report any
   recent sick contacts per family.  Leucocytosis likely a stress response
   to NSTEMI, as it is now trending down.
   - Hold antibiotics unless further evidence of PNA
   - Trend leukocytosis; culture as symptoms localize
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive.
   - Trend, improved on repeat labs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely fluid overload given flash pulmonary edema,
   poor Lasix compliance and LE edema.
   - Diurese as above, trend
   - Send urine lytes, FeUrea

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and psychiatric issues. He presents for follow-up after experiencing loss of consciousness, likely due to ischemic heart failure or a vaso-vagal episode. The patient has a history of multiple previous myocardial infarctions (MIs) and was found to have an acute thrombus in the coronary arteries during a cardiac catheterization. No stent was placed, and the patient is being managed medically. He is also allergic to heparin.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Coronaries: Multiple prior MIs, with rising troponins after diaphoresis and loss of consciousness, without ECG changes of ischemia, most consistent with NSTEMI. Cardiac cath did not show any intervenable lesions. Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor, Imdur, and lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur, and Toprol. 
- Went to cardiac cath for diagnosis, acute thrombus found but will be medically managed. No stent placed.
- Given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily.
- On bivalirudin gtt because of a heparin allergy. Will continue gtt for 48hrs.
- Given 600"

   Assessment and Plan
    59 M with htn, hyperlipidemia, CM, CAD, CHF, CRI, h/o stroke and
   psychiatric issues presents for follow up.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness: Most likely hypoperfusion due to ischemic
   heart failure, though other possibilities include acute CVA, vaso vagal
   episode and hypoxia due to respiratory failure.  Seizure unlikely.
   - Evaluate cardiac function as below.
   - Lower sedation in AM to fully assess mental status.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Multiple prior MIs, with rising troponins after
   diaphoresis and loss of consciousness, without ECG changes of ischemia,
   most consistent with NSTEMI.  Cardiac cath did not show any
   intervenable lesions.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor,
   Imdur and lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Went to cardiac cath for diagnosis, acute thrombus found but will be
   medically  managed. No stent placed.
   - Given ASA 600mg PR, then 325mg PO daily.
   - On bivalirudin gtt because of a heparin allergy. Will continue gtt
   for 48hrs.
   - Given 600mg Plavix load, to be continued on 75mg daily.
   - Uptitrated beta blocker tp 37.5 mg TID.
   - Restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - ?CABG candidacy, will discuss further w/ attendings
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial
   ischemia and hypertensive urgency.  Lung exam much improved this
   morning and is requiring less aggressive vent settings.
   - Diuresis slow overnight, but has improved with higher BPs. I/O goal
   of -500cc today. Will recheck Cr this afternoon.
   - Tolerating lower vent settings, will continue to wean while following
   ABGs.
   - If tolerates lower PEEP, can wean to pressure support ventilation.
   - Follow serial ABGs. ? A line placement.
   - sputum cultures show 1+ GPC, sputum and blood cultures pending
   - Received one dose of broad spectrum abx in CCU, now holding b/c there
   are not signs of infection.
   .
   # PUMP: EF of 20%, mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis and regional
   akinesis on TEE.  BNP is lower than on previous admissions, suggesting
   that he may not have acutely elevated atrial pressures. Overall
   concerning for ischemic worsening of already poor systolic function.
   - goal -500cc to 1L today. Continue Lasix gtt.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and daily weights.
   .
   # RHYTHM: In sinus tachycardia. Will need beta-blocker for prevention
   of post-MI arrhythmias.
   .
   # DM.  Followed by [**Last Name (un) 294**], with poor compliance, though patient was
   apparently still taking his insulin at home.
   - restarted home Humalog 75/25 at 70AM/60PM
   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c
   .
   # Hypertension.  Slightly hypotensive overnight in the setting of
   NSTEMI.  Now improving, and will most likely become hypertensive soon.
   - restart metoprolol on return from cath.  Restart Imdur this morning.
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - hold amlodipine in peri MI setting.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: poorly controlled, was not taking high-dose statin
   prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   .
   #  Respiratory Failure: Arrived in hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   Exact etiology unclear but may be due to flash pulmonary edema in the
   setting of cardiac ischemia.  No e/o massive PE or infection to explain
   large A-a gradient.
   - Continue mechanical ventilation
   - Diurese as able with Lasix gtt
   - Daily breathing trials, RSBI, VAP bundle
   - Monitor ABGs, check upon arrival to CCU
   .
   # CRI: Cr bumped up in the setting of diuresis and CTA dye load, now
   trending down to 2.4 with baseline of 1.6.
   - Urine lytes show pre-renal etiology in setting of ischemia, urine cx
   negative
   - diurese for now, monitor Cr closely
   - renally dosed medications.
   .
   #  Respiratory Acidosis: Due to hypoventilation in the setting of
   respiratory failure.  Improving with ventilation.
   - Trend ABGs, ? A-line
   .
   #  +Anion Gap Metabolic Acidsosis.  Lactic Acidosis.
   - Resolved upon admission to CCU, monitor
   .
   #  Elevated Troponin: Most likely due to NSTEMI and acute plaque
   rupture.  Other possibilities include hypertensive emergency or
   decompensated CHF.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has been afebrile and does not report any
   recent sick contacts per family.  Leucocytosis likely a stress response
   to NSTEMI, as it is now trending down.
   - Hold antibiotics unless further evidence of PNA
   - Trend leukocytosis; culture as symptoms localize
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive.
   - Trend, improved on repeat labs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely fluid overload given flash pulmonary edema,
   poor Lasix compliance and LE edema.
   - Diurese as above, trend
   .
   FEN: Hypervolemic / replete PRN / Diabetic tubefeeds ordered

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, previous stroke, and psychiatric issues. He presented for follow-up and was found to have loss of consciousness, which was most likely due to hypoperfusion secondary to ischemic heart failure. Other possible causes included acute cerebrovascular accident (CVA), vaso-vagal episode, and hypoxia due to respiratory failure. The patient's cardiac function was evaluated, and he was found to have multiple prior myocardial infarctions (MIs), with rising troponin levels after diaphoresis and loss of consciousness. He underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed an acute thrombus but no intervenable lesions. He was managed medically instead of undergoing stent placement. The patient was given aspirin 600mg orally, followed by 325mg daily, and placed on bivalirudin gtt due to a heparin allergy. He was also started on a Plavix load of 600mg, to be continued on 75mg daily, and uptitrated beta-blocker to 37.5mg TID. Lisinopril was restarted as tolerated, and the patient's candidacy for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) will be discussed further with the attending physicians.

The patient also experienced dyspnea, which was most likely due to pulmonary edema in the"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), previous stroke, and psychiatric issues. He presented for follow-up and was admitted due to chest pain, shortness of breath, and loss of consciousness. The patient has multiple comorbidities including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM).

The patient's current condition includes acute systolic heart failure with pulmonary edema, NSTEMI, and elevated troponin levels. He is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The patient has a fever, tachycardia, and is agitated and combative when sedation is decreased. His blood pressure is controlled with metoprolol and lasix, and he is also receiving bivalirudin for heparin allergy.

The patient has pre-renal azotemia with a creatinine level of 2.4 and is being diuresed with lasix. His electrolytes are within normal limits, but he has hyponatremia likely due to fluid overload. The patient's HbA1c is 9.9, indicating poor control of his diabetes.

The potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of his heart failure, further ischemic events, and infection due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), and previous stroke. He presented to the hospital with chest pain and was diagnosed with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Cardiac catheterization did not reveal any intervenable lesions, and an acute thrombus was found but managed medically without stent placement. The patient has a history of non-compliance with medications and poor glycemic control.

During the stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been unstable. He has been agitated and combative when attempts were made to decrease sedation, requiring increased doses of sedatives. His PTT levels were initially elevated, and bivalirudin was initiated due to a heparin allergy. The patient's renal function has improved, with a decrease in creatinine levels from 2.6 to 2.4. He has been receiving diuretics, and his fluid balance has been closely monitored. His blood pressure has been managed with metoprolol and lisinopril.

The patient's pulmonary status has shown improvement, with decreased pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. His oxygenation has been good, and he has tolerated lower ventilator settings. However, he did not tolerate weaning from mechanical ventilation for more than 15 minutes before experiencing"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, previous stroke, and psychiatric issues. The patient presented with respiratory failure and was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient has multiple medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Coronary artery disease: The patient has diffuse three-vessel disease (3VD) and is not a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Therefore, he is being medically managed. The patient was on aspirin, isosorbide mononitrate, and metoprolol prior to admission. He is now on ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg daily, and his metoprolol dose has been increased to 100mg QID. Lisinopril and amlodipine have been restarted.

2. Dyspnea/pulmonary edema: The patient's dyspnea is most likely due to pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial ischemia and hypertensive urgency. His lung exam has improved since successful extubation. Lasix has been discontinued, and the patient will be given Lasix 60mg as needed.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressures are extremely labile and continue to spike to SBP 200 when agitated. Metoprolol has"

   Assessment and Plan
    59 M with htn, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD, CHF, CRI, h/o stroke and
   psychiatric issues found to have 3VD which is unvascularized and is nt
   a good CABG candidate and resp. failure s/p successful extubation
   yesterday
   .
   # CORONARIES: Negative ECG but positive enzymes, consistent w/ NSTEMI.
   Cardiac cath w/o intervenable lesions but diffuse 3VD.  Not a good CABG
   candidate b/c of poor distal bypass points.  Therefore being medically
   managed.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor, Imdur and
   lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Cont ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg daily.
   - Metoprolol 10mg IV Q6hrs titrated as tolerated and changed to PO
   - Restart lisinopril this morning.
   - not a good CABG candidate (poor distal bypass points)
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial
   ischemia and hypertensive urgency.  Lung exam much improved s/p
   successful extubation.
   - Cont Lasix gtt, responded well overnight
   - sputum cultures show negative
   .
   # Hypertension: Pressures extremely labile.  On nitro drip, but
   continues to spike to SBP 200 when agitated.
   - uptitrate metoprolol to 50 mg QID
   - Cont Imdur
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - restart amlodipine
   ..
   # PUMP: Decompensated systolic HF mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis
   and regional akinesis on TEE.CXR today looks improved, but still with
   bilateral pleural effusions.
   - goal - 1L to 1.5 today. Continue Lasix gtt.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and daily weights.
   .
   #Altered mental status: Most likely hypoperfusion due to ischemic heart
   failure, although vasovagal also possible and agitated.
   - Did not tolerate decreased sedation, becomes agitated and combative,
   will try again today
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has been afebrile and does not report any
   recent sick contacts per family.  Leucocytosis likely a stress response
   to NSTEMI, as it is now trending down.
   - Hold antibiotics unless further evidence of PNA
   - Trend leukocytosis; culture as symptoms localize
   .
   # RHYTHM: In sinus tachycardia. Will need beta-blocker for prevention
   of post-MI arrhythmias.
   .
   # DM.  Followed by [**Last Name (un) 294**], with poor compliance, though patient was
   apparently still taking his insulin at home.
   - adjust home Humalog 75/25 at 70AM/60PM for improved control
   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c 9.9
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: poorly controlled, was not taking high-dose statin
   prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   .
   # CRI: Cr bumped up in the setting of diuresis and CTA dye load, now
   trending down to 2.4 with baseline of 1.6.
   - Urine lytes show pre-renal etiology in setting of ischemia, urine cx
   negative
   - diurese for now, monitor Cr closely
   - renally dosed medications.
   - avoid Ativan

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and a previous stroke. The patient was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) which is unvascularized and not a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient also experienced respiratory failure but was successfully extubated yesterday.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 37.6°C (99.6°F)
- Heart rate: 108 bpm (range: 77-124 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 137/74 mmHg (range: 91/56 mmHg - 200/97 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 18 breaths per minute (range: 9-28 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 98% on room air

The patient has been on several medications including aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and Plavix. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, and platelet count. The patient's cardiac enzymes (CK, CKMB, Troponin-T) are elevated, indicating a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient's electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function tests are within normal ranges"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and psychiatric issues. He was found to have triple vessel disease that is unvascularized and not a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient also experienced respiratory failure post-myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and was successfully extubated. He has been managed medically due to poor distal bypass points. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure continues to spike to 200 mmHg when agitated. He is currently on nitroglycerin drip and other antihypertensive medications, but further adjustments may be needed to control his blood pressure.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely has pulmonary edema due to myocardial ischemia and hypertensive urgency. Lasix has been discontinued, and the patient will be tried on Lasix 60mg to manage this condition.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with an increase in white blood cell count. Blood and urine cultures have been ordered, and antibiotics will be held unless further evidence of pneumonia is present.
4. Decompensated Systolic Heart Failure: The patient has mild left ventricular dilation, global hypokinesis, and regional akinesis on transesophageal ech"

   # CORONARIES: Negative ECG but positive enzymes, consistent w/ NSTEMI.
   Cardiac cath w/o intervenable lesions but diffuse 3VD.  Not a good CABG
   candidate b/c of poor distal bypass points.  Therefore being medically
   managed.  Was previously on Aspirin, Toprol-XL, Lipitor, Imdur and
   lisinopril, though he was only taking ASA, Imdur and Toprol.
   - Cont ASA 325mg PO daily, Plavix 75mg daily.
   - Metoprolol 10mg IV Q6hrs
   - Restart lisinopril when tolerated
   - not a good CABG candidate (poor distal bypass points)
   .
   # Dyspnea: Most likely pulmonary edema in the setting of myocardial
   ischemia and hypertensive urgency.  Lung exam much improved this
   morning and is requiring less aggressive vent settings.
   - Cont Lasix gtt, responded well overnight
   - Tolerating lower vent settings with PEEP 5, good oxygenation, will
   continue to wean while following ABGs.
   - decrease sedation to see if RR improves
   - control BP to prevent flash pulm edema during extubation (will not
   extubate today)
   - sputum cultures show 1+ GPC, sputum and blood cultures pending
   - Received one dose of broad spectrum abx in CCU, now holding b/c there
   are not signs of infection.
   .
   # Hypertension: Pressures extremely labile.  On nitro drip, but
   continues to spike to SBP 200 when agitated.
   - uptitrate metoprolol to 50 mg QID
   - Cont Imdur
   - restart lisinopril as tolerated
   - restart amlodipine
   ..
   # PUMP: EF of 20%, mild LV dilation, global hypokinesis and regional
   akinesis on TEE.  BNP is lower than on previous admissions, suggesting
   that he may not have acutely elevated atrial pressures. Overall
   concerning for ischemic worsening of already poor systolic function.
   CXR today looks improved, but still with bilateral pleural effusions.
   - goal - 1L to 1.5 today. Continue Lasix gtt.
   - [**Hospital1 **] electrolytes and daily weights.
   .
   # Loss of Consciousness: Most likely hypoperfusion due to ischemic
   heart failure, although vasovagal also possible
   - Did not tolerate decreased sedation, becomes agitated and combative,
   will try again today
   .
   # RHYTHM: In sinus tachycardia. Will need beta-blocker for prevention
   of post-MI arrhythmias.
   .
   # DM.  Followed by [**Last Name (un) 294**], with poor compliance, though patient was
   apparently still taking his insulin at home.
   - adjust home Humalog 75/25 at 70AM/60PM for improved control
   - FS QACHS with humalog sliding scale.
   - HbA1c 9.9
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: poorly controlled, was not taking high-dose statin
   prior to admission.
   - Restart Atorvastatin 80mg Qdaily
   .
   # CRI: Cr bumped up in the setting of diuresis and CTA dye load, now
   trending down to 2.4 with baseline of 1.6.
   - Urine lytes show pre-renal etiology in setting of ischemia, urine cx
   negative
   - diurese for now, monitor Cr closely
   - renally dosed medications.
   - avoid Ativan

   #  Acid/Base: Respiratory Acidosis: Due to hypoventilation in the
   setting of respiratory failure.  Improving with ventilation.
   - Trend ABGs.
   #  +Anion Gap Metabolic Acidsosis.  Lactic Acidosis.
   - Resolved upon admission to CCU, monitor
   .
   #  Elevated Troponin: Most likely due to NSTEMI and acute plaque
   rupture.  Other possibilities include hypertensive emergency or
   decompensated CHF.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Patient has been afebrile and does not report any
   recent sick contacts per family.  Leucocytosis likely a stress response
   to NSTEMI, as it is now trending down.
   - Hold antibiotics unless further evidence of PNA
   - Trend leukocytosis; culture as symptoms localize
   .
   # Thrombocytosis: Likely reactive.
   - Trend, improved on repeat labs
   .
   # Hyponatremia: Most likely fluid overload given flash pulmonary edema,
   poor Lasix compliance and LE edema.

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, and psychiatric issues. The patient was found to have triple vessel disease (3VD) that is unvascularized and not a good candidate for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). He also had respiratory failure post successful extubation. The patient's current condition includes decompensated systolic heart failure with mild left ventricular dilation and global hypokinesis on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient has been uncooperative at times, refusing a chest X-ray and not taking medications as prescribed. The patient's recent events include being on nitro drip for hypertension, experiencing leukocytosis with low-grade fever, and having an altered mental status that is now clearing up. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and an elevated HbA1c level of 9.9%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's refusal to take medications and refusal of a chest X-ray could increase the risk of developing pneumonia. The leukocytosis and low-grade fever may also indicate an infection.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine levels suggest impaired kidney function, which could be due to the patient's chronic renal insufficiency or recent diuretic use.
3. Hypertensive Emergency: The patient's high blood pressure readings and labile pressures indicate a risk of hypertensive emergency, which could lead to end-organ damage if not managed promptly.
4. Diabetic Complications: The elevated HbA1c level indicates poor glycemic control, putting the patient at risk for diabetic complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state.
5. Arrhythmias: The patient's sinus tachycardia and history of myocardial infarction increase the risk of developing arrhythmias post-MI.
6. Heart Failure: The patient's decompensated systolic heart failure indicates ongoing cardiac dysfunction, which requires close monitoring and management.

Please note that this summary is based on the information provided in the progress note, and additional details or tests may be necessary to make a comprehensive assessment."
