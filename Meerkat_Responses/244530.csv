","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures, who presents with altered mental status. The patient has been intubated for airway protection and requires minimal ventilatory support. There are several potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided:

1. Infection: The patient's altered mental status and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of an infection, such as pneumonia. The CSF picture is complicated by a traumatic lumbar puncture, but meningitis cannot be completely excluded. Line infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or urinary tract infection are also possible.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's urine output is adequate, suggesting that obstruction is less likely. However, the presence of febrile neutrophilic aura (FNA) and recent use of cefepime raises the possibility of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). The eosinophils in the urine are a non-specific finding.

3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 35% to 29% following IVF but was discharged with an Hct of approximately 30%. No gross bleeding has been noted. Repeat PM hct should be performed, and transfusion should be considered when hemoglobin levels fall below 7.

4. Bladder repair: The patient has had two previous bladder ruptures, and currently has chronic Foley and suprap"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presented with altered mental status and is currently intubated in the ICU for airway protection. The patient has multiple comorbidities including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and acute renal failure. He is receiving various medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and metoclopramide. The patient's recent laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated BUN/Cr ratio, and decreased hemoglobin levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's presentation suggests a possible infection, such as pneumonia or meningitis. His sputum culture showed gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters, and his CSF gram stain was negative but could still be complicated by a traumatic lumbar puncture. He is currently being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is elevated (>20:1), indicating prerenal azotemia. However, his fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) is 6.5%, which makes acute tubular necrosis (ATN) less likely. Other causes of acute renal failure, such as acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) from cefepime, should be considered. The patient's urine output"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture, presenting with altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated for airway protection and requires minimal ventilatory support. There are no signs of seizure activity. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have leukocytosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and tremulousness. The patient is also on multiple medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metaclopramide, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is suspected to have delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia. There is also a possibility of line infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or urinary tract infection (UTI). Cultures and HSV PCR are pending for further evaluation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's BUN/Cr ratio is greater than 20:1, suggesting prerenal azotemia. However, the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) is 6.5%, which is less consistent with this. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is less likely due to the absence of significant hypotension. Consideration should be given to allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) in the setting of recent cefepime administration. The patient's urine output needs to be closely monitored, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presents with altered mental status and leukocytosis. The patient is intubated in the ER for airway protection and requires minimal ventilatory support. There are no signs of seizure activity on MRI. The patient has acute renal failure, anemia, and is on multiple medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, metoclopramide, and others. He has a history of MDR UTIs and is currently on chronic Foley and suprapubic catheters. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a low blood pressure and heart rate within normal ranges. His respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. The patient has pleural effusions and a small pericardial effusion on CT abdomen, along with an airspace opacity concerning for aspiration. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but decreased creatinine and glucose levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient is being treated for suspected delirium secondary to infection, possibly pneumonia, with continued vancomycin and ceftriaxone. The patient's acute renal failure is being monitored, and the Foley and suprapubic catheters will be continued"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presented with altered mental status. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. He has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, suspected delirium secondary to infection (possibly pneumonia), and a complicated CSF picture due to a traumatic lumbar puncture. Other potential causes of his altered mental status include line infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or urinary tract infection. Medications such as metoclopramide may also contribute to his condition.

Plan:
- Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone for now, but discontinue ceftriaxone if CSF cultures are negative after 48 hours.
- Continue vancomycin for gram-positive cocci in sputum.
- Discontinue metronidazole.
- Follow up pending cultures and HSV PCR, and reculture if febrile.
- Hold metoclopramide and wean sedation.
- Seek recommendations from neurology regarding the patient's condition.
- Pursue spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) since the patient's Respiratory Support Burden Index (RSBI) is 53.
- Monitor urine output and creatinine levels, and adjust medication dosages accordingly.
- Maintain catheterization to gravity.
- No acute interventions required at this time, according to urology.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with an altered mental status, who is intubated and sedated in the ICU. The patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status, and the review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), oxycodone, megestrol acetate, Ritalin (methylphenidate Hcl), and Remeron (mirtazapine). The last doses of antibiotics were ceftriaxone and metronidazole on 06/18/2176 at 04:00 AM and 05:41 AM, respectively.

The patient is currently receiving propofol at a rate of 10 mcg/kg/min, lorazepam (Ativan), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, which are none. Review of systems is unobtainable due to the patient being intubated and sedated.

Flowsheet data as of 06/18/2176 at 07:21 AM shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 68 bpm (66-92), blood pressure ranging from 60/34 mmHg to 160/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute ("

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with recent bladder fracture who presented from rehabilitation with altered mental status and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including leukocytosis, acute renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect airway, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 93/40 mmHg to 138/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and unable to provide any history.

The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, sedatives, anticoagulants, and respiratory support. The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal blood glucose levels.

The patient's imaging shows an infiltrate in the left lower lobe of the lungs, and the microbiology report indicates the presence of gram-positive cocci in the sputum.

The patient's assessment and plan include treating leukocytosis, altered mental status, renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect airway, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The treatment plan involves managing infections, adjusting antibiotics based on culture data, continuing EEG and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with recent bladder fracture and altered mental status. The patient is intubated for airway protection. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Infection: The patient has broad antibiotics to cover meningitis and there is evidence of infection with leukocytosis and positive gram-positive cocci in sputum.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has an ABG result showing hypoxemia.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels and is at risk for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to recent antibiotic use.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating hypotension.
5. Airway aspiration: Due to the patient's inability to protect his airway, there is a risk of aspiration pneumonia.
6. Seizure activity: The patient has evidence of seizure activity on EEG.
7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient has elevated glucose levels.
8. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension.
9. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has irregular heart rhythm.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these potential complications to ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status. He has a history of encephalopathy, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous surgeries. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He is being treated with CPAP and has been diagnosed with myoclonus and seizure activity, leading to the initiation of acyclovir therapy. The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, and iron studies and hemolysis labs have been ordered. Tube feeds were held overnight due to potential extubation, and the patient has developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient was unresponsive to dilantin and experienced hypotension, so ativan was given for recurrent seizure activity. A line was placed, and the patient is unable to provide history.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizure activity: The patient has shown signs of myoclonus and seizure activity, which may indicate ongoing seizure episodes or an increased risk for further seizures.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), indicating possible renal dysfunction or acute kidney injury.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate hypotension, which could be due to various causes such as sepsis, cardiac dysfunction, or medication side effects.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm has"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs, who presents with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status, leukocytosis
   Suspect delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia vs
   intermittent seizures. CSF picture complicated by traumatic LP, but
   can
t complete exclude meningitis. Line infection, recurrent
   intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained but less likely. No
   evidence of seizure activity on MRI. Acute renal failure and
   medications (eg metaclopramide) could also be contributory)
   - Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone for now,  DC ceftriaxone if CSF
   cultures negative x48 hours
   - Not started on acyclovir on presentation, think HSV encephalitis less
   likely so okay to hold off for now
   - Continue vancomycin for GPCs in sputum
   - DC flagyl
   - Follow up pending cultures and HSV PCR, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> 24hr EEG, follow up recs
   .
   HAP: As per above.  Likely contributing to decline.  Does have copious
   secretions still
   - f/u sputum cx
   - send urine legionella
   - Cont vanco, CTX, azithro for now -> D/C azithro once legionella
   negative
   - Monitor vanco levels
   .
   * Tremulousness
   Probably due to current infection, may also be renal failure related.
   No evidence of seizure activity.
   - Follow, treating infection as above
   - f/u EEG
   * Vent
   Intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
 Requiring minimal
   ventilatory support currently.
   - RSBI 53, pursue SBT today
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Will give addl 1L of IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause
   .
   * Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.
   - Repeat PM hct.
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   .
   * s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now with
   chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   * DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   * Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol
   .
   * HTN: Stable.  Cont metoprolol.  Hold amlodipine for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presents with altered mental status, leukocytosis, and possible intermittent seizures. The patient has been intubated in the ER for airway protection and is currently requiring minimal ventilatory support. He also has acute renal failure, anemia, and a history of multiple catheters.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has signs of pneumonia or urinary tract infection (UTI), as indicated by leukocytosis and abnormal sputum culture results. The presence of GPCs (Gram-positive cocci) in the sputum suggests a possible respiratory infection, while the negative urine legionella Ag indicates a less likely cause of pneumonia. The patient is currently being treated with vancomycin and ceftriaxone.

2. Seizures: The patient's neurologic findings consistent with myoclonus and an EEG showing seizure activity suggest ongoing seizure episodes. Acyclovir has been started pending HSV PCR results, indicating a suspicion of herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis.

3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN/Cr ratio and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure. Causes could include sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AIN), medication effects, or previous exposure to nephrotoxic agents.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs, who presents with altered mental
   status.
   .
   * Altered mental status, r/o meningitis
   Suspect delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia vs
   intermittent seizures. CSF picture complicated by traumatic LP, but
   can
t completely exclude meningitis. Line infection, recurrent
   intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained but less likely. Acute
   renal failure and medications (eg metaclopramide) could also be
   contributory.
   - Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone for now. It appears that
   antibiotics were given PRIOR to LP in ER therefore cultures might be
   falsely negative. Given age would consider adding ampicillin
   empirically
   - Continue acyclovir pending HSV PCR.
   - Follow up pending micro, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> 24hr EEG, follow up recs
   .
   * Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Await neuro recs regarding alternative antiepileptic
   .
   HAP: As per above.  Likely contributing to decline.  Does have copious
   secretions still
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cont vanco, CTX
   - DC azithromycin, urine legionella negative
   - Monitor vanco levels
   * Vent
   Intubated in the ER for
[**Month/Year (2) 9112**] protection.
 Requiring minimal
   ventilatory support currently.
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Will give addl 1L of IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause
   .
   * Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.
   - Repeat PM hct.
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   .
   * s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now with
   chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   * DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   * Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presents with altered mental status, which could be due to infection, intermittent seizures, or medication side effects. The patient has multiple medical complications, including potential pneumonia, line infection, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, anemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient may have a pneumonia or line infection, as indicated by the presence of fever, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal chest x-ray findings.
2. Seizures: The patient has had recurrent seizure activity, which could be caused by acute infection such as meningitis or other underlying neurological conditions.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels suggest possible acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 29.3 to 26.8 g/dL, indicating possible anemia. Further investigation and management are necessary.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation, which requires rate control and anticoagulation management.
6. Nutritional support: The patient requires nutritional support, as tube feeding has been initiated.
7. Medication management: The patient is on multiple medications, and careful"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture, who presents with altered mental status. He is currently intubated in the ICU for protection and requiring minimal ventilatory support. The patient's condition has been unstable, with recent events including hypotension, seizure activity, suspected delirium, acute renal failure, anemia, and ongoing management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to his altered mental status, hypotension, and positive findings on chest X-ray suggestive of pneumonia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and further cultures are pending.
2. Meningitis: Given the patient's altered mental status and CSF findings, meningitis should be ruled out. Empiric coverage for meningitis, including vancomycin and ceftriaxone, has been initiated.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be secondary to delirium, possibly due to infection, intermittent seizures, or medications.
4. Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's renal function is deteriorating, as indicated by increasing creatinine levels and low urine output. Possible causes include sepsis, medication-induced nephrotoxicity, or urinary tract infection.
5. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows growth of Staphy"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, recent bladder rupture, and peritonitis. The patient presents with altered mental status and seizure activity of unclear etiology. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of recent bladder rupture and peritonitis, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is important.
2. Seizure activity: The patient has experienced seizure activity, and it is necessary to monitor for any further episodes. Ensuring seizure safety measures are in place, such as continuous EEG monitoring, is crucial.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive on multiple occasions, which may be due to medication-related causes. Close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management with fluids or pressors as needed are essential.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure. Monitoring kidney function and consulting with a nephrologist if there is further deterioration is important.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and it is necessary to manage this cardiac arrhythmia with appropriate medications, such as metoprolol, and consider anticoagulation therapy.
6. Airway protection: Due to the patient's inability to protect his own"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, recent bladder rupture, and peritonitis.
- He presented with altered mental status and seizure activity of unclear etiology.
- The patient was unable to tolerate a loading dose of dilantin due to severe hypotension and required norepinephrine for about an hour.
- He has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and is currently on metoprolol.
- The patient's blood pressure is low and the cause is unclear, but it appears to be medication-related.
- He has acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, likely related to gentamicin use.
- The patient's altered mental status and seizure activity are ongoing, and an alternative anti-seizure medication may be necessary.
- Continuous EEG monitoring is recommended.
- The patient's risk for aspiration is high due to altered gag reflex and inability to protect airway.
- His respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube and controlled mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's labs show leukocytosis, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes.
- Imaging shows a small left effusion but tubes and lines are in place.
- Microbiology results indicate coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus in sputum.
- The patient's assessment includes leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypot"

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,

   status, seizures, now with hypotension.
   .
   * Hypotension: Now stable.  Off pressors.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been related to
   extreme reaction to dilantin (as temporally related to dilantin load)
   vs sepsis.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic.  ECHO with preserved EF
   and no real valve pathology.  Hct stable.  Less concern for AI.
   - Hold dilantin -> switched to phosphenytoin
   - For potential sepsis, he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - PICC port cleared, now has two ports
   - Cont metoprolol cautiously
   - f/u micro
   .
   * Altered mental status, r/o meningitis
   Suspect delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia vs
   intermittent seizures. CSF picture complicated by traumatic LP, but
   can
t completely exclude meningitis and are treating for now. Line
   infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained
   but less likely. Acute renal failure and medications (eg
   metaclopramide) could also be contributory.  Now may be very slow to
   clear given acute stress on underlying dementia
   - It appears that antibiotics were given PRIOR to LP in ER therefore
   cultures might be falsely negative. Continue vanc, ceftriaxone, bactrim
   for now. Check vanco trough.
   - Follow up pending micro, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> role for continuing 24hr
   EEG, ?less sedating AEDs

   * Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG

   * Vent
   Intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
   - Change to PSV now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apeic episodes
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Genlte IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   .
   * Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 27 and stable, no signs of active bleeding
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   .
   * s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now with
   chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   * DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Assessment and Plan
 LEUKOCYTOSIS
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), TYPE II
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs, who presents with altered mental
   status, seizures, now with hypotension.
   .
   * Hypotension: Now stable.  Off pressors.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been related to
   extreme reaction to dilantin (as temporally related to dilantin load)
   vs sepsis.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic.  ECHO with preserved EF
   and no real valve pathology.  Hct stable.  Less concern for AI.
   - Hold dilantin -> switched to phosphenytoin
   - For potential sepsis, he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - PICC port cleared, now has two ports
   - Cont metoprolol cautiously
   - f/u micro
   .
   * Altered mental status, r/o meningitis
   Suspect delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia vs
   intermittent seizures. CSF picture complicated by traumatic LP, but
   can
t completely exclude meningitis and are treating for now. Line
   infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained
   but less likely. Acute renal failure and medications (eg
   metaclopramide) could also be contributory.  Now may be very slow to
   clear given acute stress on underlying dementia
   - Continue vancomycin and ceftriaxone for now. It appears that
   antibiotics were given PRIOR to LP in ER therefore cultures might be
   falsely negative.
   - Added bactrim for listeria given PCN allergy
   - HSV PCR neg -> D/C
d acyclovir
   - Follow up pending micro, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> 24hr EEG, follow up recs
   - ? ID consult for antibiotics
   .
   * Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neuron recs, EEG
   .
   HAP: As per above.  Likely contributing to decline.  Does have copious
   secretions still
   - f/u sputum cx
   - Cont vanco, CTX (d1 = [**6-17**])
   - DC
d azithromycin, urine legionella negative
   - Vanco levels high -> will change dosing
   * Vent
   Intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
 Requiring minimal
   ventilatory support currently.
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apeic episodes
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Genlte IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   .
   * Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 27 and stable, no signs of active bleeding
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   .
   * s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now with
   chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   * DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   * Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP

   The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal.
   Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality
   cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
   low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal defect. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate aortic valve
   stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen.
   The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not
   be determined. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
   echocardiographic signs of tamponade.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient presented with altered mental status.
- A stool culture was taken on 06/19, and blood cultured on 06/20.
- The patient is allergic to penicillins and has a history of nausea/vomiting with certain medications.
- Antibiotics were administered, including fosphenytoin for seizures, TMP-SMX for listeria coverage, and metronidazole.
- An echo revealed EF 50-55%, moderate AS, and moderate MR.
- The patient experienced bursts of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response overnight, so metoprolol was resumed TID.
- The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure.
- The patient is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and insulin infusion for glycemic control.
- Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention.
- The patient's condition is being closely monitored in the ICU with ongoing assessments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for infections due to the presence of an indwelling catheter and previous antibiotic use. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever or increased white blood cell count, is important.
2. Seizure: The patient has had seizures, and fosphenytoin has been administered. Monitoring for recurrent seizures and adjusting antiepileptic drug therapy may be"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, recent bladder rupture, and peritonitis. The patient presented with altered mental status and was intubated for altered mental status of unclear etiology. The patient has been diagnosed with leukocytosis, acute renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect airway, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and potential early meningitis or stroke.

The patient has undergone several tests and procedures, including stool culture, blood culture, echocardiogram (TTE), chest X-ray, and EEG. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 105 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/63 mmHg to 141/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

The patient's physical examination revealed crackles at the bases of the lungs bilaterally and trace edema in both extremities. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, potassium levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and glucose. The echocardiogram showed mild left ventricular hypertrophy, moderate aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, small pericardial effusion, and no signs of tamponade.

   (neg clx on CSF), no evidence of AIP on head CT from [**6-17**], ? renal
   failure as a contributing factor.

   >Intubation: changed to PS as he is able to breathe on his own, while
   on volume control he developed a respiratory alkalosis (pCO2: 29) and a
   his HCO3 decreased (possibly as a compensatory

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of recent bladder rupture and altered mental status resulting in intubation with unclear etiology. The patient is critically ill and has multiple medical complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infection or inflammatory response.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing seizures on EEG with potential multifactorial etiology, possibly due to infection/meningitis given the elevated WBC on traumatic tap (neg clx on CSF) or renal failure as a contributing factor.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has stable creatinine levels with likely pre-existing damage from gentamicin toxicity. Renal dose medications should be adjusted accordingly.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and IV beta blockers may be used for now. Further management will depend on the patient's condition.
5. Hypotension: The patient has low blood pressure, and the cause may be related to phenytoin load. Phosphenytoin has been used to resolve the issue. TTE does not show impaired contractility (moderate AS).
6. Intubation: The patient requires continued mechanical ventilation until his mental status improves. Pressure support mode has been changed from CPAP/PSV due to respiratory alkalosis and decreased HCO3.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with recent history of bladder rupture and altered mental status, resulting in intubation with unclear etiology. He has been critically ill and is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support. His vital signs show a heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient has leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, type II diabetes mellitus, benign hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has elevated white blood cell count and a recent history of traumatic tap with negative clx on CSF. This raises the possibility of infection, such as meningitis.
2. Seizures: The patient experienced seizures as seen on EEG, which can be multifactorial in etiology. This could be due to infection, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has stable creatinine levels but with a likely pre-existing hit from gentamicin toxicity. There is also mention of renal dose medications, indicating ongoing management of renal function.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, which needs to be monitored and managed appropriately.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, and there have been"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a recent history of bladder rupture and altered mental status resulting in intubation with unclear etiology. The patient has multiple medical conditions including leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, risk for aspiration, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 122/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine, low total CO2, and normal glucose levels. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, trace edema in both extremities, warm skin, and normal neurologic tone with no spontaneous movement. 

The patient's assessment and plan include altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, risk for aspiration, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently off sedation with minimal improvement in neurologic exam. Controversial antibiotics have been discontinued, and renal dose medications have been initiated.

   normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
   abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Overall left ventricular systolic
   function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is moderate
   aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.0-1.2cm2). Trace aortic
   regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened.
   Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of bladder rupture, altered mental status, and recent intubation. He is currently in the ICU with several potential medical complications.

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 122/60 mmHg to 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is intubated and sedated.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging results show mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with a normal left ventricular cavity size. There is also moderate aortic valve stenosis, trace aortic regurgitation, and moderate mitral regurgitation. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. Additionally, there is a small pericardial effusion.

The patient's assessment and plan include leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect airway, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and previous bladder rupture.

   infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained
   but less likely. Acute renal failure and medications (eg
   metaclopramide) could also be contributory.  Now may be very slow to
   clear given acute stress on underlying dementia
   - It appears that antibiotics were given PRIOR to LP in ER therefore
   cultures might be falsely negative. Continue vanc, ceftriaxone, bactrim
   for now. Check vanco troughs.
   - Follow up pending micro, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> role for continuing 24hr

   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mr [**Known lastname 8961**] is slow to arouse despite lack of clinical or EEG seizure
   activity ( off sedation). He needs continued supportive care ( On CPAP/
   PSV at 5/5 with stable ventilation) and antibiotic support for presumed
   CNS infection. All blood and CSF cultures have been negative to date.
   He has remained hemodynamically stable too.
   We will only attempt extubation when he is arousable and able to defend
   his airway
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presented with altered mental status, seizures, and was intubated for airway protection. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with antibiotics. He also has acute renal failure, anemia, and a history of bladder repair. The patient's condition is critically ill, and he requires continued supportive care and antibiotic treatment. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and seizures could be due to meningitis. The CSF picture is complicated by a traumatic lumbar puncture, but meningitis cannot be completely ruled out. The patient is being treated for meningitis as a precautionary measure.
2. Line infection: The patient has a history of recurrent intrabdominal infection and UTIs. There is a possibility of a line infection, but it is less likely compared to meningitis.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a BUN/Cr ratio greater than 20:1. The cause of renal failure could be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), medication-induced nephrotoxicity, or obstructive uropathy. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has decreased from 35% to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status, currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and recent surgical procedure. The patient is receiving multiple medications including phenytoin, warfarin, megestrol acetate, mirtazapine, and methylphenidate.

24-hour events include administration of additional dose of phenytoin, no imaging or repeat LP recommended by neurology. Allergies are noted for amoxicillin, penicillins, and Coumadin (warfarin sodium). The patient has received various antibiotics including acyclovir, vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), and ceftriaxone.

Vital signs are within normal range with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate between 74-133 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 121/57 to 152/80 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,690 mL including 864 mL of PO, 1,180 mL of TF, and 1,290 mL of IVF. Output includes 1,264 mL of total out with 392 mL of blood products, 1,264 mL of urine, and 472 mL of NG output. The patient's respiratory support consists of CPAP/PSV mode with set Vt of 550 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR set at 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 35%, and RSBI of 60.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated, eyes open and fixed straight, PERRL, anicteric sclera, irregularly irregular S1 S2 II/VI systolic murmur, clear lungs bilaterally, soft abdomen with bowel sounds, and dependent edema. The patient is not following commands but responds to verbal/painful stimuli.

Lab results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, increased Cr, TCO2, and glucose levels. Other lab values including PT/PTT/INR, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, lactic acid, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 are also noted.

Assessment and Plan include leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect airway, risk for aspiration, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk due to prolonged mechanical ventilation. Regular assessment of respiratory status and implementation of V"

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs, who presents with altered mental
   status, seizures, now with hypotension.
   .
   * Hypotension: Now stable.  Off pressors.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been related to
   extreme reaction to dilantin (as temporally related to dilantin load)
   vs sepsis.  Does not appear to be cardiogenic.  ECHO with preserved EF
   and no real valve pathology.  Hct stable.  Less concern for AI.
   - Hold dilantin -> switched to phosphenytoin
   - For potential sepsis, he is on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
   - PICC port cleared, now has two ports
   - Cont metoprolol cautiously
   - f/u micro
   .
   * Altered mental status, r/o meningitis
   Suspect delirium secondary to infection, probably pneumonia vs
   intermittent seizures. CSF picture complicated by traumatic LP, but
   can
t completely exclude meningitis and are treating for now. Line
   infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or UTI also entertained
   but less likely. Acute renal failure and medications (eg
   metaclopramide) could also be contributory.  Now may be very slow to
   clear given acute stress on underlying dementia
   - It appears that antibiotics were given PRIOR to LP in ER therefore
   cultures might be falsely negative. Continue vanc, ceftriaxone, bactrim
   for now. Check vanco trough.
   - Follow up pending micro, reculture if febrile
   - Hold metaclopramide, wean sedation
   - Neurology recommendations appreciated -> role for continuing 24hr
   EEG, ?less sedating AEDs
   .
   * Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   .
   * Vent
   Intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
   - Change to PSV now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apeic episodes
   .
   * Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Genlte IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   .
   * Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 27 and stable, no signs of active bleeding
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   .
   * s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now with
   chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   * DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   * Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presents with altered mental status, seizures, and hypotension. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, anemia, and chronic urinary catheterization.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with altered mental status, hypotension, and fever suggests the possibility of sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started, and cultures are pending. The patient's history of multiple drug-resistant urinary tract infections (UTIs) raises concern for a potential source of infection.
2. Meningitis: Despite the traumatic lumbar puncture (LP), there is a suspicion of meningitis, and the patient is being treated empirically with antibiotics.
3. Airway Complications: The patient is unable to protect his airway, which necessitates intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of aspiration due to altered mental status.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be due to prerenal causes, acute tubular necrosis (ATN), or contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating anemia. This may be related to"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture. He presents with altered mental status, seizures, and a suspicion of meningitis. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics prior to lumbar puncture (LP) in the emergency room, which might have resulted in falsely negative cultures. He is currently on vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim. Other concerns include line infection, recurrent intrabdominal infection, or urinary tract infection (UTI), but these are less likely. Acute renal failure and medications could also be contributing factors. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 121/57 mmHg, heart rate of 74 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation with pressures set at 5 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 35%. His urine output is adequate, and there are no signs of active bleeding. The patient has a history of chronic Foley and suprapubic catheter usage. His blood sugars are stable, and his atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled. The patient's care in the ICU includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He presents with altered mental status, seizures, and signs of infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. He has multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus type 2. The patient's condition is stable but critical, and he requires ongoing monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status and seizures may be indicative of meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is pending, and antibiotics have been started empirically.
2. Line infection: The patient has a history of recurrent intrabdominal infection and UTIs. The presence of leukocytosis and positive cultures from the central line suggest a possible line infection.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause, such as acute tubular necrosis (ATN) or allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN).
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or the effects of medications.
5. Airway protection: The patient's inability to protect his airway necessitates ongoing mechanical ventilation and careful"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status,
   seizures,
    1. Altered mental status,
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure. Additional possibility includes
   seizures as had some seizure activity on recent EEGWill likely be slow
   to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phenytoin
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   .
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
  Tolerating
   PSV well currently
   - Cont PSV for now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apneic episodes
   - if mental status improves, consider extubation
   .
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   .
   5. Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Genlte IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   .
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   .
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures.
- The patient has been intubated in the ER for airway protection and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well.
- His mental status has improved slightly, but he is still not following commands and responds only to verbal or painful stimuli.
- The patient has been diagnosed with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to compensatory respiratory alkalosis from forced controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) and administration of normal saline (NS) for hypotension.
- There are concerns about acute renal failure, with a BUN/Cr ratio >20:1 at presentation, suggesting prerenal azotemia. However, the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 6.5%, which makes acute tubular necrosis (ATN) less likely. The patient's urine output has been adequate, and there are no signs of obstruction.
- The patient also has anemia with a hematocrit (Hct) level down to 25 from 35 following intravenous fluid administration. There are no signs of active bleeding, and the anemia is likely due to phlebotomy effect and inflammation.
- The patient underwent a"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status,
   seizures,
   Altered mental status,
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure. Additional possibility includes
   seizures as had some seizure activity on recent EEGWill likely be slow
   to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim day 5
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   .
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
  Tolerating
   PSV well currently
   - Cont PSV for now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apneic episodes
   - if mental status improves, consider extubation
   - SBT today
   .
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   .
   5. Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Genlte IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   .
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   .
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   .
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   .
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   .
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.
   - RUQ U/S to assess for DVT

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture repairs. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient's current condition includes:
1. Altered mental status: Likely due to delirium caused by infection and seizures.
2. Seizures: Precipitated by acute infection or meningitis.
3. Respiratory failure: Intubated for airway protection, tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing, possibly due to compensatory response or underlying renal tubular acidosis (RTA).
5. Acute renal failure: Urine output is adequate, suggesting no obstruction. BUN/Cr ratio is high, indicating prerenal azotemia. FeNa is low, making acute tubular necrosis (ATN) less likely. Consideration should be given to allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to recent cefepime use.
6. Anemia: Hct has decreased from 35% to 29% due to phlebotomy effect and inflammation.
7. s/p Bladder repair: Chronic Foley and suprapubic catheters are in place. Clear drainage observed.
8. DM2: Blood sugars are stable.
9. Afib: Rate-controlled, not on coumadin due to past hemorrhage.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures, potentially indicating meningitis or a pulmonary source of infection. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/53 to 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's neurological assessment shows that he follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but has not been assessed for movement or tone. His extremities show asymmetric swelling in the lower limbs.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, low total CO2, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows an unrevealing chest X-ray. Cultures have been ordered to guide further treatment.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status due to infection +/- seizure: The patient is being treated with antibiotics (vancomycin, Bactrim, and ceftriaxone) following cultures. Phenytoin has been initiated per neurologic recommendations.
2. Airway, inability to protect: The patient requires frequent suctioning due to impacted secretions, affecting extubation. A spontaneous breathing"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status,
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure. Additional possibility includes
   seizures as had some seizure activity on recent EEGWill likely be slow
   to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
  Tolerating
   PSV well currently
   - Cont PSV for now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apneic episodes
   - if mental status improves, consider extubation
   - SBT today
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   5. Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.
   - LUE U/S to assess for DVT

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. The patient was admitted with altered mental status and seizures.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Altered mental status - likely due to delirium related to infection and seizures. Additional possibilities include renal failure.
2. Seizures - likely precipitated by acute infection/meningitis.
3. Respiratory failure - patient intubated for airway protection. Currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis - stabilizing, possibly a compensatory response to metabolic alkalosis from forced diuresis or received normal saline in the setting of hypotension.
5. Acute renal failure - urine output adequate, suggesting no obstruction. BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation, suggesting prerenal picture. FeNA 6.5% is less consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN), although urine obtained later in the day in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension. Consider acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) in the setting of recent cefepime administration.
6. Anemia - Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross bleeding. Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status,
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure. Additional possibility includes
   seizures as had some seizure activity on recent EEGWill likely be slow
   to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
  Tolerating
   PSV well currently
   - Cont PSV for now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apneic episodes
   - if mental status improves, consider extubation
   - SBT today
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   5. Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.
   - LUE U/S to assess for DVT

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient's current conditions include altered mental status likely due to delirium caused by infection and seizures. He also has respiratory failure, non-anion gap acidosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and a history of bladder repair.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of respiratory failure if the patient's mental status does not improve, leading to difficulty weaning off the ventilator. The patient's acute renal failure may progress, potentially requiring dialysis or further interventions. There is also a possibility of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) given the left upper extremity swelling, which could be related to the PICC line. The patient's anemia may worsen, and close monitoring of blood counts is necessary. Additionally, the patient's history of bladder ruptures and ongoing catheterization puts him at risk for urinary tract infections or further complications related to the bladder repair.

Overall, the patient's conditions require close monitoring and management of respiratory support, renal function, electrolyte balance, and infection control measures."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure and seizures as had some seizure
   activity on recent EEG. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. Tolerating PSV
   well currently and successful SBT currently.  Has cough and gag reflex.
   Although patient has secretions, his mental status has improved over
   the last 48-72 hours.
   - will extubate today
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   5. Acute renal failure
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - increase metoproll to 37.5mg
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been intubated and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to delirium caused by infection and seizures. Additional possibilities include renal failure and seizures. The patient will continue to receive vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for a 14-day course, and follow-up blood cultures will be done.

2. Seizures: The patient had seizures that were likely precipitated by acute infection or meningitis. He is now on phenytoin for seizure treatment, and neurology recommendations will be followed.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated in the emergency room for airway protection. He is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well and has successfully undergone a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT). His mental status has improved over the last 48-72 hours. The plan is to extubate the patient today.

4. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient has a stabilizing non-anion gap acidosis. This may be a compensatory response to forced diuresis with citrate (CMV) causing bicarbonate wasting. It could also be due to recent normal saline (NS) administration in the setting of hypotension or underlying renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to new renal failure. The urine pH is 6.5 with low bicarbonate. Type 1 RTA versus acute renal failure (ARF) will be determined. No supplemental bicarbonate is currently needed.

5. Acute Renal Failure: The etiology of acute renal failure is thought to be related to gentamicin during a prior admission. Urine output from catheters is adequate, arguing against obstruction. BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggests prerenal picture, but fractional excretion of sodium (FeNA) is 6.5%, which is less consistent with this diagnosis. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is less likely in the absence of significant hypotension. Gentle intravenous fluids (IVF) will be continued. The patient's urine output, creatinine levels, and medications will be closely monitored. Renal dosing of medications will be considered if creatinine levels increase. Bactrim may be considered as a cause or alternative to gentamicin.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (Hct) has decreased from 35% to 29% following intravenous fluids but was discharged with an Hct of approximately 30%. There is no gross bleeding. The patient's Hct is now 25% and stable, with no signs of active bleeding. The an"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status,
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure. Additional possibility includes
   seizures as had some seizure activity on recent EEGWill likely be slow
   to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs, EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for
airway protection.
  Tolerating
   PSV well currently
   - Cont PSV for now
   - No plans to extubate until mental status improves
   - Does have intermittent apneic episodes
   - if mental status improves, consider extubation
   - SBT today
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Stabilizing.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb currently
   5. Acute renal failure
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]). Consider AIN
   in the setting of recent cefepime. Urine does have eos, but this is a
   non-specific finding.  Concerning for gent effect from last admission
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per uruology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - Cont metoprolol as has bursts of afib at night
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. He is currently intubated in the ICU for respiratory failure. The patient has multiple medical complications including non-anion gap acidosis, acute renal failure, anemia, and a history of bladder repair. He is also diagnosed with possible small thrombosis around the PICC line in the left brachial vein.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has altered mental status, which may be related to delirium caused by infection and seizures. Additional possibilities include renal failure and seizures.
2. Seizures: The patient had seizures, which were likely precipitated by acute infection, possibly meningitis. He is now on phenytoin for seizure control.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. He is tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well but has intermittent apneic episodes. There are no plans to extubate until mental status improves.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient has non-anion gap acidosis, which is stabilizing. It could be a compensatory response to forced capillary circulation (CMV) or respiratory alkalosis resulting in bicarbonate wasting. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is also a"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted with altered mental status presumed to be related to seizures and possible meningitis. The infectious workup has been negative. The patient is currently on day 7 of treatment with vancomycin, CTX, and day 4 Bactrim. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: Despite negative cultures, the possibility of infection cannot be ruled out completely. The patient is still receiving empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial meningitis.
2. Seizures: The patient's altered mental status may be related to seizures. The patient is currently on phenytoin for seizure prophylaxis, and the level should be rechecked today.
3. Airway Compromise: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which poses a risk for aspiration and altered gag reflex. He requires suctioning every 2 hours and is on CPAP/PSV mode of ventilation.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and rate control should be achieved with metoprolol. However, the patient is not on coumadin due to past hemorrhage.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient may have acute renal failure, possibly due to gentamicin toxicity or acute tubular necrosis. Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be dosed accordingly.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male admitted with altered mental status presumed to be related to seizures +/- meningitis. The infectious workup has been negative. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 118/56 to 178/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and edema in the left upper extremity. Neurologically, the patient follows simple commands and responds to verbal stimuli but movement, tone, and skin assessments were not performed.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels, along with normal hemoglobin (Hct) and platelet count (Plt). Imaging reveals a nonocclusive clot around the peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) in the left upper extremity and a left pleural effusion.

The assessment and plan include altered mental status presumed due to infection +/- seizure, which will be treated with a 14-day course of empiric antibiotics. The patient's inability to protect the airway is a concern for aspiration and altered gag reflex. The patient is stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with an altered mental status. He has been in the ICU since 6/20/2176 and is currently intubated. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure. He is on multiple medications including heparin, lansoprazole, fosphenytoin, and ceftriaxone.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient's vital signs have been relatively stable with a temperature of 37.7 C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/65 to 158/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 2959 mL, output of 2515 mL, and a positive balance of 444 mL.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 66 mg/dL to 142 mg/dL, and acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL. Other lab values including platelet count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and coagulation profile are within normal limits.

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure and seizures as had some seizure
   activity on recent EEG. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course (D1 =
   [**6-17**])
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   - Repeat MRI
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - MRI brain today to eval for etiology
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. Tolerating PSV
   well currently and successful SBT currently.  Has cough and gag reflex.
   Although patient has secretions, his mental status has improved over
   the last 48-72 hours.
   - will extubate after MRI today vs tomorrow
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - increase metoproll to 37.5mg
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show tachycardia, normal blood pressure, and decreased oxygen saturation. The patient has leukocytosis, acute renal failure, impaired skin integrity, hypertension, and altered mental status. He also has anemia, a history of bladder repair, diabetes mellitus type 2, atrial fibrillation, left upper extremity swelling, and deep vein thrombosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which is often caused by infections, medication side effects, or other underlying conditions.
2. Meningitis: The patient's recent seizure activity and altered mental status raise the possibility of meningitis, especially since he had a traumatic lumbar puncture.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. He has a successful spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), indicating that he may be ready for extubation soon.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly due to gentamicin during his prior admission. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact etiology.

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure and seizures as had some seizure
   activity on recent EEG. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course (D1 =
   [**6-17**])
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   - Repeat MRI
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - MRI brain today to eval for etiology
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. Tolerating PSV
   well currently and successful SBT currently.  Has cough and gag reflex.
   Although patient has secretions, his mental status has improved over
   the last 48-72 hours.
   - will extubate after MRI today vs tomorrow
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - increase metoproll to 37.5mg
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. He has been intubated in the ER for airway protection and is currently tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) well. His mental status has improved over the last 48-72 hours. He has a new PICC line placed, an old PICC line pulled, and a left PICC line that ends at the junction of the brachiocephalic veins. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. He has 3+ UE edema (left > right), ecchymoses over the left hand, and is unable to wiggle his toes. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, renal failure, hyperglycemia, and hyponatremia. His chest X-ray shows small bilateral pleural effusions and left basal atelectasis. The patient's assessment includes impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypotension (not in shock), airway inability to protect (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), diabetes"

The patient is currently being treated for seizures, respiratory failure, non-anion gap acidosis, acute renal failure, anemia, surgical wound healing, and type II diabetes. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of renal function, respiratory distress, infections, bleeding due to anticoagulation therapy, and further episodes of seizures."

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status, who is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and impaired skin integrity. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 122/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on FiO2 35%. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's chest x-ray reveals small bilateral pleural effusions and left basal atelectasis. The patient's plan includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to mechanical ventilation. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and production of purulent secretions, is essential. Early mobilization and maintaining appropriate head-of-bed elevation can help reduce the risk of VAP.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing"

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to delirium in the setting of infection and
   seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional
   possibilities include renal failure and seizures as had some seizure
   activity on recent EEG. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   - Repeat MRI
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - Repeat MRI
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. Tolerating PSV
   well currently and successful SBT currently.  Has cough and gag reflex.
   Although patient has secretions, his mental status has improved over
   the last 48-72 hours.
   - will extubate after MRI today vs tomorrow
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - If increases consider CTX as cause or bactrim
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - increase metoproll to 37.5mg
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient's current conditions include impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypotension (not in shock), inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough), type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for a 14-day course, following up with blood cultures, continuing phenytoin for seizure treatment, repeating MRI, extubation after MRI today or tomorrow, and monitoring for non-anion gap acidosis. The patient also has acute renal failure, likely caused by gentamicin during a prior admission. Gentle IVF is recommended, along with monitoring urine output and creatinine levels. Renally dosing medications is also advised.

Additionally, the patient has anemia, which is likely due to phlebotomy effect and inflammation. Active T+S should be maintained, and transfusion should be considered when hemoglobin levels fall below 7. The patient has a history of bladder repair and currently has chronic Foley and SP catheterization. No acute interventions are required at this time. The patient's diabetes is stable, so continuing gl"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a depressed mental status related to seizure and CNS infection, who is intubated for airway protection. The patient has several medical conditions and allergies. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Infection: The patient's depressed mental status is presumed to be due to infection +/- seizure. There is a potential source of meningitis or pulmonary infection, although no positive culture data has been obtained yet. The patient is on antibiotics to treat presumed bacterial meningitis with negative cultures.
2. Airway obstruction: The patient has an inability to protect his airway, which poses a risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance. He is currently stable on pressure support ventilation (PSV) and tolerated spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) for the past two days. The plan is to extubate him after an MRI brain scan.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is being managed with rate control using metoprolol. However, no coumadin is given due to past hemorrhage.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient may have acute renal failure, possibly due to gentamicin toxicity and also potentially associated with acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) given the urine eosinophils and prior antibiotic use. Renal function is being monitored, and medications are being dosed accordingly. Supportive care is"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Slightly improved.  Now tracks, eyes open, occasionally follows
   commands.  Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to
   seizures delirium in the setting of infection and seizures. CSF was
   traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional possibilities
   include renal failure. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d9 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs, will ask about utility of repeat EEG to eval for
   persistent seizures, will also ask about possibly switching to keppra
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently and once again not [**Doctor Last Name **] controlled.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol IV (will increase from 5 to 10 mg IV q 6)
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed (will pull back as appears to be in RA)
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient's current condition shows improvement in mental status, although it may take time to clear due to background dementia. He has been successfully extubated after being intubated for airway protection. The patient's respiratory failure is resolved.

The patient has a non-anion gap acidosis that is resolving. This could be a compensatory response to forced CO2 blowing off, resulting in bicarbonate wasting. It may also be related to underlying renal tubular acidosis (RTA) due to new renal failure, as indicated by a urine pH of 6.5 and low bicarbonate levels. This could be type 1 RTA or acute renal failure (ARF) continuing since the last admission. The patient's renal function is now at a new baseline, suggesting acute renal failure likely related to gentamicin during the prior admission. The BUN/Cr ratio is greater than 20:1, suggesting a pre-renal picture, but the fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) is 6.5%, which is less consistent with this diagnosis. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is less likely in the absence of significant hypotension. 

The patient also has anemia, with a hematocrit (Hct"

   No evidence for acute ischemia.
   Slight progression of periventricular hyperintensity which could
   reflect
   progression of small vessel ischemia. Less likely, this could represent
   transependymal CSF flow from NPH.
   Foci of hypersignal in the right frontal and parietal lobe which were
   not
   present on the prior MRI may represent interval ischemia which is
   chronic
   CXR
   Bilateral small effusions with prominent hilar and vascularity
   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to seizures delirium in the setting of
   infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d9 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis. MRI without any
   mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed

   No evidence for acute ischemia.
   Slight progression of periventricular hyperintensity which could

   progression of small vessel ischemia. Less likely, this could represent
   transependymal CSF flow from NPH.
   Foci of hypersignal in the right frontal and parietal lobe which were
   not
   present on the prior MRI may represent interval ischemia which is
   chronic

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Etiology is likely related to seizures delirium in the setting of
   infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d9 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   - Repeat MRI
   2.  Seizures
   Likely precipitated by acute infection ?meningitis
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - MRI brain today to eval for etiology
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Patient was intubated in the ER for airway protection. Tolerating PSV
   well currently and successful SBT currently.  Has cough and gag reflex.
   Although patient has secretions, his mental status has improved over
   the last 48-72 hours.
   - will extubate after MRI today vs tomorrow
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Gentle IVF
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont glargine with HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently.  Rate controlled.  Not on coumadin given
   past hemorrhage.
   - increase metoproll to 37.5mg
   - IV BB prn, watch BP
   10 LUE Swelling: [**Month (only) 60**] be related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture repairs. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been treated for suspected meningitis and respiratory failure. He has a history of chronic kidney disease and anemia. The patient also has a recent bladder repair with chronic Foley and suprapubic catheters. He is currently in the ICU and is expected to stay there.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status is likely related to seizures, delirium in the setting of infection, and background dementia. It may take time for him to clear the infection and for his mental status to improve.
2. Seizures: The patient's seizures were likely precipitated by acute infection or meningitis. He is currently on phenytoin to prevent further seizures, and further evaluation by neurology is recommended.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection and is now tolerating pressure support ventilation well. He may be extubated after the MRI today or tomorrow, depending on his condition.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis: The patient had a compensatory response from forced capnia, resulting in bicarbonate wasting. This could be a response to respiratory center failure or renal failure. The urine pH is 6.5, and bicarbonate levels are low. Type 1 renal"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status. They have a history of impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, acute renal failure, hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and inability to protect their airway. The patient is currently extubated and on standby ventilation mode with an FiO2 of 50%. They have coarse breath sounds bilaterally with a few wheezes but no rales. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 133/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels and an increased lactic acid level. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure and is on prophylactic heparin sodium. An MRI of the head shows no evidence of acute ischemia but slight progression of periventricular hyperintensity. The patient's recent blood cultures have been negative.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

Based on the patient's condition and medical history, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway, they are at risk for aspiration pneumonia. The use of mechanical ventilation may also lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has a complex medical history with multiple ongoing medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is presumed to have altered mental status due to infection and/or seizure activity. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and appropriate management.

2. Airway management: The patient previously had an inability to protect their airway, which posed a risk for aspiration. However, they were successfully extubated on [**6-24**]. Airway clearance and cough reflexes should continue to be monitored for any signs of respiratory compromise.

3. Atrial fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib with underlying aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Rate control is being achieved with metoprolol, and the 12-lead ECG should be reviewed to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which may be related to previous gentamicin toxicity or other factors. Close monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels is necessary. Medications requiring dosage adjustments should be reviewed and managed accordingly.

5. Pulmonary complications: The patient's chest X-ray shows low long volumes, increasing pulmonary venous congestion, and small effusions. These findings suggest possible respiratory issues that need to be addressed, such as optimizing fluid balance and considering interventions to improve"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient was extubated on 6/24 after being on invasive ventilation.
- MRI results showed no evidence of acute ischemia, but there was slight progression of periventricular hyperintensity and foci of hypersignal in the right frontal and parietal lobe, which could represent interval ischemia.
- The patient has altered mental status presumed due to infection and/or seizure. They have a history of baseline dementia.
- The patient is on vancomycin, Bactrim, and ceftriaxone for presumed bacterial meningitis with negative cultures.
- Phenytoin has been started per neuro recommendations, and the level yesterday was good. Consider changing to keppra and repeat EEG.
- The patient has airway issues, including inability to protect it (risk for aspiration, altered gag, airway clearance, cough).
- The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFIB) with underlying AS and moderate MR.
- Rate control with metoprolol is recommended, and check 12 lead ECG to confirm AFIB vs sinus tach.
- No coumadin due to past hemorrhage.
- The patient has acute renal failure and is being monitored for urine output and creatinine levels.
- Medications are being adjusted for renal function.
- Supportive care is being provided.
- Left upper extremity swelling was found, and a clot was discovered. The PICC line was pulled and replaced with a right upper extrem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of dementia, atrial fibrillation, and renal failure, who presented to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have a urinary tract infection and was empirically treated for presumed bacterial meningitis due to his altered mental status. The patient underwent invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated on day 6. His MRI brain showed no acute processes or evidence of cerebritis/meningitis. The patient's renal function has been monitored, and medications are being renally dosed. He also has a history of pulmonary edema, left upper extremity swelling, and a PICC line clot, which has been replaced with a right upper extremity PICC line. The patient's current medications include vancomycin, Bactrim, ceftriaxone, metoprolol, fosphenytoin, and supportive care for renal failure. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure of 133/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient was initially treated for presumed bacterial meningitis and had a urinary tract infection. Close monitoring for any signs of infection is necessary, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered if needed.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has a history of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical conditions and potential complications. 

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is presumed to have an altered mental status due to infection or possibly a seizure. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause. The patient is more interactive today compared to previous days.

2. Airway Intubation: The patient has an altered airway, making it difficult to protect. There is a risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, and impaired airway clearance and cough.

3. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib, and rate control is being maintained with metoprolol. Coumadin is not being used due to past hemorrhage.

4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which could be due to gentamicin toxicity, analgesic nephropathy (AIN), or other factors. Monitoring of urine output and creatinine levels will be continued. Renally dosed medications will be administered, and supportive care will be provided.

5. Left Upper Extremity (LUE) Swelling: The patient was found to have a clot in the LUE PICC line, which was subsequently removed and replaced with a right upper extremity (RUE) PICC line.

Overall, the patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of their altered mental status, airway protection, AFib, acute renal failure"

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Slightly improved.  Now tracks, eyes open, occasionally follows
   commands.  Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to
   seizures delirium in the setting of infection and seizures. CSF was
   traumatic but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional possibilities
   include renal failure. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of
   background dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d9 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs, will ask about utility of repeat EEG to eval for
   persistent seizures, will also ask about possibly switching to keppra
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently and once again not [**Doctor Last Name **] controlled.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol IV (will increase from 5 to 10 mg IV q 6)
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed (will pull back as appears to be in RA)
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a medical history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient's current condition includes impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypotension (not in shock), and risk for aspiration.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure of 111/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. His physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, coarse breath sounds bilaterally, regular heart rhythm, and warm extremities. The patient is able to open his eyes to voice, squeeze hands, and wiggle toes upon command.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, increased platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and normal electrolyte levels. The patient's renal function is compromised as evidenced by the increased BUN/Cr ratio and fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa).

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, ceftriaxone, bactrim, fosphenytoin, metoprolol, and furosemide. The patient's plan of care involves continuing vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been in the ICU for several days, receiving various treatments and interventions. He has shown some improvement in his mental status but remains at risk for further complications. His current medical conditions include impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, inability to protect the airway, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest.
2. Leukocytosis: The elevated white blood cell count indicates a possible ongoing infection or inflammation.
3. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status remains altered, which could be due to various factors such as infection, seizures, or renal failure.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and he is at risk for further deterioration.
5. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure indicates a potential risk for inadequate tissue perfusion.
6. Inability to protect the airway: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored to prevent aspiration pneumonia.
7. Diabetes mellitus type II: The patient's blood sugar levels need to be closely monitored to prevent hyperglyc"

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Improved since yesterday, more responsive.  Following commands this
   am.  Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to seizures
   delirium in the setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic
   but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal
   failure. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of background
   dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d10 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs, will ask about utility of repeat EEG to eval for
   persistent seizures, will also ask about possibly switching to keppra
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently and once again not [**Doctor Last Name **] controlled.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol IV (will increase from 5 to 10 mg IV q 6)
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed (will pull back as appears to be in RA)
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures.
- The patient presented with altered mental status and seizures, and was admitted to the ICU.
- Initial workup included blood cultures, sputum cultures, and CSF analysis, which showed no evidence of meningitis.
- The patient's seizures appear to have stopped, and he has been successfully extubated.
- The patient's renal function has deteriorated further, with an acute renal failure.
- The patient's respiratory status is improving, but there is evidence of fluid overload on chest X-ray.
- Other issues include impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.
- The patient also has anemia, which is likely due to phlebotomy and inflammation.
- The patient had a recent bladder repair, with chronic Foley and suprapubic catheters in place.
- His blood sugars are stable, and he remains in atrial fibrillation.
- The patient developed a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) related to a previously placed PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient is at risk for pressure ulcers due to immobility and decreased nutritional status.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory"

   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Improved since yesterday, more responsive.  Following commands this
   am.  Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to seizures
   delirium in the setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic
   but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal
   failure. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of background
   dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d10 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs, per yesterday, will continue phosphenytoin for
   now w/o need for repeat EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently and once again not [**Doctor Last Name **] controlled.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol IV (will increase from 5 to 10 mg IV q 6)
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. His current conditions include impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, hypotension (not shock), and inability to protect airway (risk for aspiration, altered gag reflex, impaired airway clearance). Other existing conditions include diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension (benign), atrial fibrillation, and previous bladder rupture.

The patient's recent progress includes improved responsiveness, with the ability to follow commands. Seizures have stopped, and he is now on phenytoin for seizure treatment. He was successfully extubated yesterday after being intubated for airway protection. The patient's non-anion gap acidosis is resolving, and he is being diuresed with a goal of -1L negative. His acute renal failure is now at a new baseline, with an etiology thought to be related to gentamicin during a prior admission. The patient has anemia, which is likely due to phlebotomy effect and inflammation. His bladder repair appears to be healing well with clear drainage. His blood sugars are stable, and he is currently in atrial fibrillation, not controlled. The patient also has left upper extremity swelling, which is likely related to the PICC line, and a deep"

   positive cx data to guide.  Does have base line dementia. Seems to be
   slowly improving
   -more interactive today than previous (minimally)
   -on vanco + Bactrim + CTX day 1 = [**6-17**] --> will complete a 14d course
   of empiric ABX for presumed bacterial meningitis w/ neg cultures
   (including listeria). Dosing Vanco by level.
   -on phosphenytoin per Neuro rec's--> cont at same dose, level yest
   good. Still dialoging on optimal regimen

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) with underlying AS and moderate MR
   (preserved EF)
   -rate control w/ metoprolol, now back on PO form via NG
   -no coumadin due to past hemorrhage

 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): thought [**3-4**] gent
   toxicity (during prev bladder rupture)
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr.
   - Renaly dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - Goal net neg

 LUE swelling- found to have clot on LUE PICC, PICC pulled and
   replaced w/ RUE PICC, needs to be pulled back
   > Nutrition and meds: needs a Dobhoff tube for now and if MS does not
   clear then consider PEG tube

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and baseline dementia. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for presumed bacterial meningitis with negative cultures. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/81 to 164/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 99%, and a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, normal cardiovascular findings, rales in the right lung, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine level, and various electrolyte imbalances. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored. The patient's nutrition and medication management are also being addressed. The patient's code status is full code and disposition is planned for transfer to the floor.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is presumed to have bacterial meningitis, which can lead to complications such as sepsis or meningococcal meningitis.
2. Seizure: The patient's altered mental status may be due to a seizure, which can have various causes including infection, electrolyte imbalances, or medication side effects."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with multiple medical conditions, including acute renal failure, atrial fibrillation, dementia, and a history of bladder rupture. He is currently admitted to the ICU for presumed bacterial meningitis and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. His mental status has been fluctuating, and there is a concern for seizures. He has been extubated and is on non-invasive ventilation. He has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, and oxycodone. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has a slightly elevated heart rate. Fluid balance shows an intake of 1580 mL and output of 1525 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for presumed bacterial meningitis. There is a risk of complications associated with the infection, such as sepsis or septic shock.
2. Seizures: The patient's mental status changes and the history of confusion/delirium raise concerns for seizures. Continued monitoring and antiepileptic drug therapy may be required.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of urine output and renal function is necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has been admitted to the ICU with several medical conditions. These include altered mental status, presumed due to infection or potential seizure activity, atrial fibrillation with underlying aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, acute renal failure, and lower extremity swelling with evidence of a clot in the left upper extremity peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) line.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/81 to 164/127 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. The patient is currently on several medications including vancomycin, Bactrim, ceftriaxone, phenytoin, metoprolol, furosemide, pantoprazole, and others.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelets, but normal creatinine levels. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with some readings within normal range and others elevated.

The assessment and plan section of the note mentions the need for a 14-day course of empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial meningitis with negative cultures. The patient's mental status is described as minimally interactive. There is also a discussion about the possibility of changing phenytoin to keppra and performing a repeat EEG. The patient's air"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions including atrial fibrillation (AF), acute renal failure, and baseline dementia. He is currently admitted to the ICU for presumed bacterial meningitis with negative cultures, and is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient also has a past hemorrhage that precludes the use of Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been diagnosed with presumed bacterial meningitis and is being treated with antibiotics. There is a risk of complications such as sepsis or central nervous system (CNS) infection progression if the infection does not respond to treatment.

2. Seizures: The patient has been prescribed phenytoin for presumed seizure activity. If the patient experiences recurrent or worsening seizures, it could indicate a more severe underlying condition or inadequate seizure control.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which requires careful monitoring of urine output and serum creatinine levels. Poor renal function can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of AF with underlying aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation (MR). Rate control measures with metoprolol are in place to manage the heart rhythm, but there is a risk of clot formation due to the presence"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and left upper extremity swelling. The patient has a history of allergies to amoxicillin, penicillins, Coumadin (warfarin sodium), oxycodone, Megestrol acetate, Remeron (mirtazapine), and Ritalin (methylphenidate Hcl). The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), blood pressure ranging from 131/84 to 160/102 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases of the lungs, soft and non-tender abdomen, and extremities with 1+ edema. The patient is currently on several medications including metoprolol, furosemide (Lasix), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others as mentioned in the note.

Potential medical complications:
1. Infection: The patient is presumed to have an infection, leading to altered mental status. Empiric antibiotics have been started, but no positive culture data are available yet.
2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has AFib with underlying aortic stenosis (AS) and moderate mitral regurgitation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. He has been in the ICU for an extended period and has multiple medical complications including atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and presumed bacterial meningitis. The patient's mental status has plateaued, and there are concerns about potential sources of infection, such as meningitis or pulmonary sources. The patient is on various medications including vancomycin, Bactrim, ceftriaxone, phenytoin, metoprolol, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, but his labs show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and slightly elevated creatinine levels. There are also concerns about his nutrition and the need for a Dobhoff tube or PEG tube if his mental status does not improve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has presumed bacterial meningitis and is being treated empirically with antibiotics. There is also concern for a potential pulmonary source of infection. Close monitoring for any signs of worsening infection or sepsis is necessary.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation with poor rate control. It is important to monitor his heart rhythm and adjust his medication regimen accordingly.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to gentamicin toxicity during a previous bladder rupture. Continued monitoring of urine output and serum"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   No major improvement since yesterday
   Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to delirium in the
   setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.  Per neuro
   given possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus his MS will improve
   slowly.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d11 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phenytoin 100mg tid w/o evidence of continued seizures,
   received extra dose yesterday given corrected level 11.6 (goal 15-20)
   - recheck level today
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - considering repeating EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated and stable on NC, had been intubated in ER
   for airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. acidosis:
   elevated gap today, previously ?RTA might be dilantin related
   - repeat UA, urine lytes,  and lactate today
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently rate control is not consistent.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol 50q6
   - amiodarone load today, pt has nl EF
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including delirium, possible meningitis, renal failure, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 131/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is alert and oriented, but has coarse breath sounds bilaterally with a few wheezes and poor respiratory effort. His extremities are warm with anasarca and palpable pulses. He has ecchymosis on his left hand. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low platelet count, elevated creatinine, and high blood glucose levels. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient is currently receiving multiple medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, bactrim, phenytoin, metoprolol, furosemide, and heparin sodium. 

The patient's medical plan includes continuing vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for a 14-day course. Phenytoin will be continued for seizure treatment, and the dosage will be adjusted based"

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been through various interventions and treatments, including the placement of an arterial line, central venous catheter, and urinary catheters.

From the provided information, the patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 131/84 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's temperature is within normal range at 36.7°C.

The patient's physical examination reveals coarse breath sounds bilaterally with a few wheezes, poor respiratory effort, and irregularly irregular heart rhythm consistent with atrial fibrillation. The abdomen is soft with bowel sounds present, and there is a well-healed midline surgical wound. Extremities are warm with anasarca palpable pulses.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.1 K/uL, slightly elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 105-210 mg/dL, and increased creatinine levels of 2.2 mg/dL.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   Improved since yesterday, more responsive.  Following commands this
   am.  Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to seizures
   delirium in the setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic
   but cannot exclude meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal
   failure. Will likely be slow to clear in the setting of background
   dementia.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d10 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phosphenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phosphenytoin w/o evidence of continued seizures
   - f/u neurology  recs, per yesterday, will continue phosphenytoin for
   now w/o need for repeat EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated yesterday, had been intubated in ER for
   airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. Non-anion gap acidosis: Resolving.  [**Month (only) 60**] have been compensatory
   response from forced CMV, blowing off C02 resulting in bicarb wasting.
   Also received NS in the setting of hypotension.  [**Month (only) 60**] also have
   underlying RTA given new renal failure.  Urine pH 6.5, with low
   bicarb.  [**Month (only) 60**] be type 1 RTA vs. his ARF continuing since last admission
   - cont to trend
   - serial ABGs
   - no need for supplemental bicarb
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently and once again not [**Doctor Last Name **] controlled.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol IV (will increase from 5 to 10 mg IV q 6)
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient had been intubated for airway protection and is now successfully extubated. He has been diagnosed with non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, anemia, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), risk for aspiration, and hypertension. The patient has been treated with various medications including vancomycin, ceftriaxone, bactrim, phenytoin, metoprolol, furosemide, heparin, and a stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status could be due to delirium, which is common in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and acute illness. It is important to monitor for any changes in mental status and provide appropriate interventions.
2. Seizure recurrence: Although the patient's seizures appear to have stopped, there is a risk for recurrence, especially if the underlying cause is not addressed. Continuous monitoring and follow-up with neurology recommendations are crucial.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient had a history of respiratory failure requiring intubation. Close monitoring of respiratory status and early intervention if necessary are essential.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. He was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, non-anion gap acidosis, acute renal failure, anemia, impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status (not delirium), hypertension, benign atrial fibrillation, and a left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has improved since yesterday but may take time to clear due to background dementia. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus could be a possible cause, and the patient is being monitored closely.
2. Seizures: The patient had seizures likely precipitated by acute infection or meningitis. Phenytoin is being administered for seizure treatment, and levels will be rechecked today.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is stable on noninvasive ventilation (NC). Fluid overload is evident on chest X-ray, and diuresis with a goal of -1 L negative is planned.
4. Non-anion gap acidosis: This condition is resolving, but the underlying cause needs to be determined. It may be a compensatory response to forced CO2 blowing off or related to renal failure.
5. Acute Renal"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   No major improvement since yesterday
   Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to delirium in the
   setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.  Per neuro
   given possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus his MS will improve
   slowly.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d11 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phenytoin 100mg tid w/o evidence of continued seizures,
   received extra dose yesterday given corrected level 11.6 (goal 15-20)
   - recheck level today
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - considering repeating EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated and stable on NC, had been intubated in ER
   for airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. acidosis:
   elevated gap today, previously ?RTA might be dilantin related
   - repeat UA, urine lytes,  and lactate today
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently rate control is not consistent.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol 50q6
   - amiodarone load today, pt has nl EF
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   No major improvement since yesterday
   Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to delirium in the
   setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.  Per neuro
   given possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus his MS will improve
   slowly.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d11 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phenytoin 100mg tid w/o evidence of continued seizures,
   received extra dose yesterday given corrected level 11.6 (goal 15-20)
   - recheck level today
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - considering repeating EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated and stable on NC, had been intubated in ER
   for airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. acidosis:
   resolved
   previously ?RTA might be dilantin related
   - repeat UA, urine lytes
 lytes hard to interpret given diuresis
   - follow for now
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA

   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   - d/w urology regarding removing staples
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: much improved on amiodarone
   - start 400mg [**Hospital1 **] post IVF load
   - also on metoprolol for bp
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder rupture, who was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Altered mental status: The patient's mental status has not improved significantly since yesterday. The possible causes of delirium include infection and seizures. Meningitis cannot be excluded due to a traumatic lumbar puncture. The patient's background dementia may slow down the recovery process. It is recommended to continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for a 14-day course. Vancomycin dosage should be adjusted based on trough levels. Blood cultures should be followed up.

2. Seizures: The patient had stopped seizing, likely due to acute infection and possible meningitis. Phenytoin was started for seizure treatment, but the recent level was 11.6 (goal 15-20). The neurology recommendations should be followed, and the phenytoin level should be rechecked. An EEG may be considered.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient was successfully extubated and is now on non-invasive ventilation. He had been intubated in the emergency room for airway protection. A chest X-ray shows evidence of fluid overload. Diuresis should be continued with a goal of removing 1 liter of fluid.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with altered mental status. The patient's heart rate has been tachycardic, and amiodarone has been loaded. Dilantin levels are above the therapeutic range, so it has been held. The patient has received diuresis with Lasix and has had some electrolyte imbalances. The patient's blood pressure is high, respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation is 96%. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic examination findings are not assessed. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. There are abnormalities in kidney function tests and elevated levels of lactic acid and lactate dehydrogenase. The patient has several medical issues including impaired skin integrity, leukocytosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hypotension, airway protection difficulty, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise include worsening renal function, infections due to leukocytosis, pressure ulcers from impaired skin integrity, respiratory complications due to airway protection difficulty, uncontrolled blood sugar levels, cardiovascular events related to atrial fibrillation and hypertension, and complications from altered mental status such as delirium or confusion."

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo M with afib, T2 diabetes, dementia, s/p bladder rupture x2,
   recent repair, with h/o MDR UTIs admitted with altered mental status
   and seizures.
   1. Altered mental status
   No major improvement since yesterday
   Etiology of initial presentation is likely related to delirium in the
   setting of infection and seizures. CSF was traumatic but cannot exclude
   meningitis. Additional possibilities include renal failure. Will likely
   be slow to clear in the setting of background dementia.  Per neuro
   given possible nonconvulsive status epilepticus his MS will improve
   slowly.
   - appreciate neurology recs.
   - continue vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and bactrim for 14 day course,
   currently d11 (D1 = [**6-17**])
   - hold vanco trough today is 31, repeat tomorrow dosing <20
   - follow-up pending blood cultures
   - continue phenytoin for seizure treatment
   2.  Seizures
   Appears to have stopped.  Likely precipitated by acute infection
   ?meningitis. MRI without any mass or evidence of recent stroke.
   - Now on phenytoin 100mg tid w/o evidence of continued seizures,
   received extra dose yesterday given corrected level 11.6 (goal 15-20)
   - recheck level today
   - f/u neurology  recs
   - considering repeating EEG
   3. Respiratory Failure
   Pt successfully extubated and stable on NC, had been intubated in ER
   for airway protection
   CXR today with evidence of fluid overload.
   - diurese with goal -1L negative
   4. acidosis:
   elevated gap today, previously ?RTA might be dilantin related
   - repeat UA, urine lytes,  and lactate today
   5. Acute renal failure: Now at a new baseline
   Etiology thought likely related to gentamicin during prior admission.
   Urine output from catheters adequate arguing against obstruction.
   BUN/Cr >20:1 at presentation suggesting prerenal picture, however  FeNA
   6.5% which is less consistent this (though urine obtained later in day
   in ICU). ATN less likely in absence of significant hypotension (SBP of
   60
s briefly x1 overnight probably not accurate [**Location (un) 308**]).
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr
   - Renally dose meds
   6. Anemia
   Hct down 35->29 following IVF but was discharged with Hct ~30. No gross
   bleeding.  Now 25 and stable though slightly lower, no signs of active
   bleeding.  Likely phlebotomy effect + inflammation
   - Maintain active T+S, transfuse Hb>7
   - Cont to trend
   7. s/p Bladder repair: Has had 2 ruptures in the last 2 years.  Now
   with chronic Foley and SP catheter.  At last admission appeared to be
   healing well with clear drainage.  Though there was a fluid collection
   in the peritoneum, was non-specific finding.  Currently draining clear
   urine with benign exam.
   - Cont Foley and SP catheter to gravity
   - No acute interventions required at this time per urology
   8. DM2: Blood sugars stable with current symptoms.
   - Cont HISS, QID fingersticks
   9 Afib: In Afib currently rate control is not consistent.  Not on
   coumadin given past hemorrhage.
   - continue metoprolol 50q6
   - amiodarone load today, pt has nl EF
   - EKG
   10 LUE Swelling: Likely related to PICC.  LE US demonstrated PICC
   associated DVT.
   - pulled PICC line
   - New PICC placed
   - Cont to monitor -> elevate arm

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and previous bladder ruptures. The patient was admitted with altered mental status and seizures. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:
1. Altered mental status: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status, which could be due to delirium caused by infection and seizures. It is likely to persist slowly in the setting of background dementia.
2. Seizures: The patient had seizures, which may have stopped but could potentially recur. The cause could be acute infection, possibly meningitis.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient was previously intubated for airway protection but is now stable on non-invasive ventilation. However, there is evidence of fluid overload on chest X-ray.
4. Acidosis: The patient has elevated gap metabolic acidosis, which could be related to RTA or dilantin use.
5. Acute renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to gentamicin during a previous admission. There is no evidence of obstruction, making acute tubular necrosis less likely.
6. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased from 35% to 29% following intravenous fluid administration. This could be due to phlebotomy effect and inflammation.
7. Bladder repair: The patient had two previous bladder ruptures and currently has chronic Foley"

 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS-presumed due to infection +/- seizure. in terms
   of potential sources, meningitis or pulm source potential but no
   positive cx data to guide.  Does have base line dementia. Concerned
   that his improvement seems to have plateau
   -on vanco + Bactrim + CTX day 1 = [**6-17**] --> will complete a 14d course
   of empiric ABX for presumed bacterial meningitis w/ neg cultures
   (including listeria). Dosing Vanco by level.
   -on phenytoin per Neuro rec's--> holding phenytoin for high level [**6-28**].
   Goal free dilantin is 1.5

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) with underlying AS and moderate MR
   (preserved EF), seems to be paroxysmal. EF 50%
   - Metoprolol 50 mg qid was increased [**6-26**]
   - Received amio load with good response [**Date range (1) 9188**]. Will add PO
   amiodarone today.
   -no coumadin due to past hemorrhage
    > Low HCO3:  now resolved, unable to check urine lytes [**3-4**] receiving
   lasix.  Suspect RTA as cause.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): thought [**3-4**] gent
   toxicity (during prev bladder rupture). Cr has been stable.
   - Continue to follow urine output, Cr.
   - Renal dose meds
   - Supportive care for now
   - Goal I/O  even to -500 cc.  Lasix prn as needed
    > Nutrition and meds: Dobhoff tube for now and if MS does not clear
   then consider PEG tube. Given no improvement x several days would
   consider PEG.

","The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status, presumed due to infection and/or seizure. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure, and baseline dementia. The patient is currently receiving empiric antibiotic therapy for presumed bacterial meningitis, with negative cultures. His atrial fibrillation appears to be paroxysmal and is being treated with amiodarone. The patient's renal function is stable, and he is receiving supportive care for acute renal failure. Nutrition support is provided through a Dobhoff tube, and consideration is being given to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube if there is no improvement in mental status. The patient has multiple comorbidities including underlying aortic stenosis and moderate mitral regurgitation, with preserved ejection fraction. He is currently on metoprolol for rate control. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, and his sodium levels have been within normal limits. His hemodynamic parameters are stable, with a heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 146/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's physical examination is significant for warm extremities, multiple ecchymosis, and mild edema in the lower extremities. Neurological examination reveals attentive behavior and purposeful movement of extremities. Laboratory results show leukocytosis, throm"

   that his improvement seems to have plateau
   -more interactive today than previous (minimally)
   -on vanco + Bactrim + CTX day 1 = [**6-17**] --> will complete a 14d course
   of empiric ABX for presumed bacterial meningitis w/ neg cultures
   (including listeria). Dosing Vanco by level.
   -on phenytoin per Neuro rec's--> cont at same dose. Still dialoging on
   optimal regimen (changed to PO).
   Will discuss with neuron re: ? repeat EEG given limited improvement in
   MS
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB) with underlying AS and moderate MR
   (preserved EF), seems to be paroxysmal. EF 50%
   - Metoprolol 50 mg qid was increased yesterday
   - With pre-existing nl EF would favor amiodarone to rate control will
   load today.
   -no coumadin due to past hemorrhage
    > Low HCO3:  seems to be worsening.
   - Check urine lytes: ? RTA from med effect  vs stool losses
   - ? med effect  causing RTA such as phenytoin (known offender)

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a chief complaint of presumed bacterial meningitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been admitted for several days. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and a previous hemorrhage. The patient's current medications include amiodarone, metoprolol, vancomycin, bactrim, ceftriaxone, phenytoin, pantoprazole, furosemide, and heparin sodium. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 59-129 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127-179 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's neurological status is noted as attentive but with confusion and delirium. He has a central line infection and requires replacement of the PICC line. The patient's renal function is monitored closely due to acute renal failure. The patient is also at risk for stress ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. He is on a feeding tube and receiving nutrition. The patient's code status is full code, and he will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system may be compromised, increasing the risk of further infections. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results is necessary to detect any signs of infection.

2. Renal failure:"
