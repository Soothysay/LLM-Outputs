   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo female with history of MG and now following admission for
   endovascular repair of AAA has had progressive weakness of peripheal
   musculature and had NIF=-40 and VC=1 liter.  Given progression patient
   had plasmapheresis started and despite that she had continued trend
   down in terms of motor strength.  In this setting she has been
   supported with NIV across the night.  This was with minimal levels of
   support and patient tolerance was quite good.  The issue going forward
   is duration of impairment in ventilatory compromise.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Certainly patient able to have ventilation
   supported by PSV delivered non-invasively.  The issue will be in the
   setting of impaired bulbar function patient does retain some
   significant risk of ongoing aspiration and progression to pneumonia.
   We do not, unfortunately, have an expectation for a rapid improvement
   in strength despite Rx in place.  NM weakness is clearly driving
   ventilatory failure this am.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted for the endovascular repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). She has been experiencing progressive weakness of peripheral musculature and had negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -40 and vital capacity (VC) of 1 liter. Despite plasmapheresis, the patient's motor strength continued to decline, and she required non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support throughout the night. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) at admission showed pH 7.48, PaCO2 44, and PaO2 145.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9Â°C, heart rate (HR) of 100 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 175/82 mmHg to 148/71 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on bipap mask with CPAP/PSV mode. She is receiving various medications including methylprednisolone, heparin sodium, hydralazine, pantoprazole, and other ICU medications.

Physical examination reveals dullness on percussion and diminished breath sounds bilaterally, decreased motor strength in upper and lower extremities, and unassessed skin and neurologic examination."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG), admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flair, requiring intubation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation. She also has electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension. The patient underwent a successful AAA repair and is receiving vascular surgery follow-up.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myasthenia Gravis Flair: The patient's worsening myasthenia flair has led to her being intubated. There is a risk of respiratory failure if the condition worsens or if there is inadequate ventilatory support.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which increases the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events such as stroke. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to reduce this risk.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which can lead to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and neurological symptoms.
4. Anemia: Although the patient's anemia is currently stable, it can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and fatigue.
5. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension, if uncontrolled, can increase the risk of end-organ damage"

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. However, the 24-hour events indicate that the patient required invasive ventilation due to an increased work of breathing. The patient was also intubated, and nasal swab for MRSA was taken.

The neurologic recommendations include administering mestinon to 60mg TID and methylprednisolone to 80mg daily. It is mentioned to limit the use of medications that aggravate myasthenia gravis and to consider plasmapheresis on the 4th day.

The patient received a 1L NS bolus for low urine output, which persisted for 5 hours. A subsequent 500 cc NS bolus was given due to elevated creatinine and BUN levels. The patient's NIF (negative inspiratory force) was -11 at around 8 pm and -17 at 6 am. The patient's PS (peak inspiratory pressure) was increased to 10 because they appeared tired, and then switched to MMV (mandatory minute volume) due to apnea.

The patient has allergies to erythromycin base. The last dose of antibiotics was not specified. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl at 75 mcg/hour and midazolam (versed) at 3 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include pantoprazole (protonix), hydralazine, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis), all started on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a chief complaint of increased work of breathing. She was intubated due to an increased need for ventilation and a Myasthenia Gravis (MG) flare. The patient has been experiencing renal failure, inability to protect her airway, diarrhea, and hypotension. She is currently on invasive ventilation, receiving medications for pain and sedation, and undergoing plasmapheresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on invasive ventilation for an extended period.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcers: The patient is at risk for stress ulcers due to critical illness, sedation, and medication use.
4. Nosocomial infection: Prolonged ICU stay increases the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections.
5. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to an inability to protect her airway, the patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information, and a comprehensive evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and management plan."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG), who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening MG symptoms, leading to intubation. The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress and required invasive ventilation. A nasal swab for MRSA testing was performed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myasthenia Gravis Flare: The patient's worsening MG symptoms required intubation. Decreasing the dose of mestinon (an anticholinesterase medication) may help decrease patient diarrhea and improve symptoms.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. A high digoxin level was noted, and the medication will be held.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient had metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which have improved. Continuous bolus IV fluids will be given as needed for likely dehydration.
4. Anemia: The patient's anemia is stable.
5. AAA Repair: The patient underwent a successful AAA repair, and vascular surgery is recommended.
6. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is improving, and IV hydralazine will continue.
7. Other Complications: The patient also has a history of MG, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, and she may be at risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has been extubated but remains on noninvasive ventilation with negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -40, indicating some respiratory muscle weakness.

Medical Complications:
1. Myasthenia Flair: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare has led to respiratory compromise necessitating intubation. The neurology team recommends repeating plasmapheresis today and encouraging CPAP during sleep. Decreasing the dose of mestinon may help reduce the patient's diarrhea.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently on anticoagulation. Digoxin levels were found to be high, so it has been held. Verapamil cannot be given while the patient is NPO.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The urinalysis indicates an infection, and cultures are pending. It is planned to discuss starting ciprofloxacin with the neurology team, as fluoroquinolones can potentially exacerbate MG.
4. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient had metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, but these have improved"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who was admitted for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient is currently in the ICU and has experienced several medical complications.

1. Myasthenia Gravis flare-up: The patient's MG symptoms have worsened, requiring intubation. The patient was extubated on [**4-2**] with an improved NIF (-40). The patient tolerated CPAP for only 5 hours overnight. It is planned to decrease the dose of mestinon to help decrease the patient's diarrhea. Neurology recommendations include repeating plasmapheresis today and following daily VC/NIF, which is improving.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but was not on anticoagulation. The digoxin level was found to be high, so it will be held. Verapamil cannot be used while the patient is NPO. The plan is to discuss starting ciprofloxacin today for a 5-7 day course if approved by neurology. This is due to the potential exacerbation of MG with fluoroquinolones.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates an infection, and cultures are pending. It is planned to start ciprofloxacin"

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG), who was admitted for an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition.

1. Respiratory Complications: The patient has been intubated and extubated multiple times, which increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Proper lung hygiene and early mobilization should be implemented to prevent this.

2. Neurological Complications: The patient's myasthenia flare may worsen, leading to respiratory muscle weakness and further respiratory compromise. Close monitoring of neuromuscular function and adjustment of medications such as plasmapheresis, mestinon, and prednisone are necessary to manage the symptoms.

3. Infection: The presence of urinary tract infection (UTI) indicated by the urinalysis results suggests a possible infection. Prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics is crucial to prevent the progression of the infection.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient has a history of metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia. Monitoring and correction of electrolyte imbalances are essential to maintain the patient's overall stability.

5. Thromboembolic Events: Despite being on subcutaneous heparin, the patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications including atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, hypertension, and hypotension. She is receiving multiple medications and treatments such as plasmapheresis, mestinon, prednisone, heparin, hydralazine, pantoprazole, and others. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a blood pressure of 173/69 mmHg and heart rate of 78 bpm. However, she is still experiencing some respiratory issues with an oxygen saturation of 92% and a negative inspiratory force (NIF) of -40 cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and abnormal kidney function tests. The urinalysis indicates the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, and bacteria, suggesting a urinary tract infection. The patient's overall condition is improving with ongoing medical interventions. She is expected to be followed by the neurology service pending clinical improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory function is still compromised, as evidenced by her oxygen saturation of 92"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo female with h/o MG and now with worsening weakness had need for
   intubation tansiently in the setting of increased secretions.   She has
   had good tolerance of extubation and continued improvement in NIF.   We
   will need to move to advance cause of improvement with mobilization and
   continued increase in po intake and activity.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Improved NIF to -40
   -Continue to get patient out of bed and work
   -Continue incentive spirometry
   2)Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 249**]-
   -Pheresis completed
   -Continue with med dosing per neurology
   -Expect to follow on medical floor going forward
   3)Cardiac-
   HTN-
   -Will continue with Verapamil and Hydral with goal to keep BP stable
   given AAA history
   4) URINARY TRACT INFECTION (UTI)
   -CTX to continue given minimal impact on MG

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and other comorbidities such as hypertension (HTN) and an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The patient was admitted due to respiratory failure, which required intubation. She has shown improvement in her negative inspiratory force (NIF) and has tolerated extubation well. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, myasthenia gravis, cardiac issues, and a urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, and measures should be taken to improve lung function and prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Myasthenia gravis exacerbation: Monitoring for worsening weakness and ensuring compliance with medication dosing as prescribed by neurology is crucial to prevent MG exacerbation.
3. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of HTN and AAA, it is important to monitor blood pressure and continue with appropriate medication to keep it stable.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The UTI should be treated appropriately to prevent any further complications related to the urinary system.

Overall, close monitoring and appropriate management of these conditions are necessary to prevent potential complications and ensure the patient's well-being."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of hypertension, diabetes, and myasthenia gravis. On admission, the patient required intubation due to poor airway protection and respiratory failure. Since then, the patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's neurologic status has fluctuated, with intermittent episodes of increased respiratory effort and decreased ventilation. These episodes have resulted in reintubation twice, with the most recent episode occurring at 2345 when the negative inspiratory force (NIF) was below 25 cmH2O and the vital capacity (VC) was 400 mL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) showed a PCO2 of 59, which further justified the need for re-intubation.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature within normal range, heart rate between 70-99 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 126/76 to 200/88 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation consistently at 100%. The patient's weight is currently 78"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis, admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but she has shown signs of fatigue and increasing CO2 levels. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection, electrolyte imbalances, anemia, hypertension, and a successful AAA repair. The patient is receiving multiple medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, hydralazine, and ceftriaxone. She is also undergoing plasmapheresis for her myasthenia gravis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's intubation and myasthenia gravis, there is a risk of respiratory complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Close monitoring of respiratory function and appropriate antibiotic treatment if necessary will be important.
2. Infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection indicated by abnormal urine analysis results. It is crucial to follow up with urine culture and continue antibiotic therapy as prescribed by the neurologist.
3. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has shown signs of metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia. Maintenance IV fluids will be necessary to manage these imbalances.
4. Bleeding: With the patient's use of ant"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient experienced a myasthenia flare post-operatively, leading to worsening respiratory function and subsequent intubation. The patient's neurologic recommendations include continuing plasmapheresis, monitoring daily vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF), and providing assisted ventilation until strength improves. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and is being treated with digoxin and verapamil. Additionally, the patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and hypertension. The patient underwent successful AAA repair, and her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening respiratory function due to the myasthenia flare has already required reintubation. Continuous monitoring and support with ventilator assistance will be necessary until the patient's strength improves.

2. Infection: The patient is currently being treated for a UTI. Cultures are pending, and appropriate antibiotics have been started. Close monitoring for any signs of infection and adjusting treatment accordingly will be important.

3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has shown signs of metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which have been managed with intravenous fluids. Regular electrolyte monitoring will be crucial to prevent any"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She required intubation due to a myasthenia flare-up and has been on ventilator support. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a suspected urinary tract infection (UTI). She has electrolyte imbalances, including metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which have been addressed with intravenous fluids. Additionally, there is a concern for anemia, as her hematocrit (Hct) dropped by 4 points this morning. The patient underwent successful AAA repair, but further vascular surgery recommendations are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare-up required intubation, indicating respiratory failure. It is important to continue ventilator support until the patient's strength improves.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. Digoxin levels are within therapeutic range, and verapamil will be held while the patient is intubated.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which hydralazine was started yesterday. Blood pressure needs to be monitored and titrated as needed.
4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates infection, and cultures are pending"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG), who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications, including atrial fibrillation, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte imbalances, anemia, hypertension, and hypotension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Myasthenia Gravis (MG) Flare: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare has led to the need for intubation. This condition can cause respiratory failure and may require prolonged ventilator support until the strength improves.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. This increases the risk of thromboembolic events such as stroke. Continuous monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to control the heart rhythm and prevent complications.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates an infection. If left untreated, this can lead to the progression of the infection and potential sepsis. It is crucial to start appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow up with urine cultures.

4. Electrolyte Imbalances: The patient has presented with metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which have been improved with intravenous fluids. Close monitoring of electrolyte"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Myasthenia flare: The patient's MG symptoms are worsening, leading to the need for intubation. The current treatment plan includes continuing ventilator support until strength improves, weaning as tolerated, and monitoring the response to plasmapheresis. Further recommendations regarding medication doses (mestinon/steroid) will be provided.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (afib) but is not currently on anticoagulation. The plan is to continue digoxin at half-dose, follow digoxin levels, and hold verapamil.

3. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates an infection, and cultures are pending. The recommended treatment includes a three-day course of ceftriaxone as per neurologic recommendations, as ciprofloxacin can worsen MG symptoms. Follow-up urine culture is planned.

4. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has had metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which improved with intravenous fluids (IVF"

   Assessment and Plan
   65 yo female with h/o MG s/p AAA repair and now with worsening weakness
   had need for intubation transiently in the setting of increased
   secretions, now reintubated for fatigue/hypercapnia.  NIFs have varied,
    decreased this morning in the setting of sedation.
    1)Respiratory Failure-
   - keep intubated for now, needs sedation for anxiety and discomfort
   - Daily NIFs
   2)Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 249**]-
   -Pheresis to continue next week for at least 2 additional sessions
   -Continue mestinon per neurology
   3)Cardiac-
   - HTN, will continue with Verapamil and hydralazine (increased) with
   goal to keep BP stable given AAA history
   4) urinary tract infection
   -CTX day 3 to continue given minimal impact on MG
   - f/u urine cx
   5) PT
 would consider getting patient out of bed to chair tomorrow

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis (MG) who underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She has worsening weakness and required temporary intubation due to increased secretions. She is now reintubated for fatigue and hypercapnia. Her NIFs (Neurological Injury Score) have varied and decreased overnight. She is sedated with midazolam and fentanyl infusions. The patient has a background of hypertension, urinary tract infection, and is on multiple medications including verapamil, hydralazine, mestinon, and solumedrol.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently intubated and requires sedation for anxiety and discomfort. There is a need to monitor her daily NIFs.
2. Myasthenia Gravis: The patient will continue with pheresis next week for at least two additional sessions and will continue taking mestinon as prescribed by neurology.
3. Cardiac: The patient has hypertension, and it is important to keep her blood pressure stable given her AAA history. She is on verapamil and hydralazine, aiming to maintain a stable blood pressure.
4. Urinary Tract Infection: The patient is being treated with ceftriaxone and will have follow-up urine cultures.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, now with worsening
   myasthenia flair requiring intubation x 2
   #. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare. Likely related to
   post-operative state. Extubated [**4-2**]. NIF -25 and increasing PCO2
   requiring reintubation. Has been difficult to balance sedation vs
   agitation and discomfort. Requiring high amounts of sedation to keep
   patient calm (otherwise pt starts pulling on the tubes,etc) but can
   become too sedated for NIF checks.  Neurology following.
   - Cont ventilator support until strength improves, wean as tolerated
   - PS trial today
   - Neurology recs: Cont plasmapheresis (2 more pheresis runs, plan for
   pheresis today) per Neuro. Cont to f/u further recs for
   mestinon/steroid dose.
   - Follow qd VC/NIF checks
   - Hold on PT exercises for now until stronger
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation. Has history of afib; not on anticoagulation
   - will change Dig to QOD dosing .
   - follow Dig level
   - Hold Verapamilmetoprolol due to MG flare
   .
   #. Hypertension.
   - Cont enalapril and hyrdalazine, titrate as needed
   - Hold verapamil as above. Holding metoprolol during MG flare (can
   exacerbate MG).
   .
   #. UTI
 U/A indicative of infection. Cultures pending.
   - s/p Ceftriaxone for 3 day (D1 [**4-3**]) course per neuro (cipro can
   worsen MG)
   - F/U Urine culture
   .
   #. Electrolyte abnormalities. Met alk and hypernatremia improved w/
   IVF.
   - Cont maintenance IVF as patient not taking good POs.
   .
   #. Anemia. Had a 4-point Hct drop this AM. Will recheck this afternoon.
   No obvious signs of GIB but not stooling at this time. Will check
   guaiac once pt has a BM.
   .
   #. AAA repair. Successful repair. Vascular surgery following.
   - f/u recs regarding staple removal, post-op care
   .
   #. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 249**]
   - CT surgery evaluating patient for future need for thymectomy
   .
   FEN: TF while intubated, will place on bowel regimen.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She experienced worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. She has been difficult to balance sedation vs agitation and discomfort, requiring high amounts of sedation to keep the patient calm. The patient has been on ventilator support until strength improves, with plans for weaning as tolerated. Plasmapheresis will be continued today per neurology recommendations. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension, for which she is being managed with appropriate medications. She completed a three-day course of ceftriaxone for a urinary tract infection (UTI). Electrolyte abnormalities have improved with intravenous fluids. Anemia is being monitored due to a drop in hematocrit levels. The patient underwent successful AAA repair. She will be evaluated by CT surgery for the future need for thymectomy. The patient is currently in the ICU and will be discussed further regarding post-operative care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient requires ventilator support due to myasthenia flare and respiratory failure. There is a risk of complications related to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which may require anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolic events. This should be managed"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, now with worsening
   myasthenia flair requiring intubation x 2
   #. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare. Likely related to
   post-operative state. Extubated [**4-2**]. NIF -25 and increasing PCO2
   requiring reintubation. Has been difficult to balance sedation vs
   agitation and discomfort. Requiring high amounts of sedation to keep
   patient calm (otherwise pt starts pulling on the tubes,etc) but can
   become too sedated for NIF checks.
   - Cont ventilator support until strength improves, wean as tolerated
   - Neurology recs: Cont plasmapheresis per Neuro. F/U further recs for
   mestinon/steroid dose.
   - Follow Q2h VC/NIF and [**Name (NI) 6611**]
   - PT consult tomorrow for OOB with assist, and strengthening exercises
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation. Has history of afib; not on anticoagulation
   - Cont Dig at half-dose. Dig level 1.5 this AM (within therapeutic
   range)
   - Hold Verapamil while intubated
 can
t crush and put in NGT
   .
   #. Hypertension.
   - Hydral was started yesterday
 will titrate up as needed.
   - Hold verapamil as above. Holding metoprolol during MG flare (can
   exacerbate MG).
   .
   #. UTI
 U/A indicative of infection. Cultures pending.
   - Ceftriaxone for 3 day (D1 [**4-3**]) course per neuro (cipro can worsen
   MG); to be completed today.
   - F/U Urine culture
   .
   #. Electrolyte abnormalities. Met alk and hypernatremia improved w/
   IVF.
   - Cont maintenance IVF as patient not taking good POs.
   .
   #. Anemia. Had a 4-point Hct drop this AM. Will recheck this afternoon.
   No obvious signs of GIB but not stooling at this time. Will check
   guaiac once pt has a BM.
   .
   #. AAA repair. Successful repair. Vascular surgery following. F/U Recs.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been difficult to ventilate support due to her myasthenia flare. She requires reintubation because of increasing PCO2 levels. The plan is to continue ventilator support until the patient's strength improves, then wean as tolerated.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. Her current heart rhythm is AFib. The plan is to continue Digoxin at half-dose and monitor the Dig level. Verapamil will be held while the patient is intubated.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 170s systolic range. Hydralazine was started yesterday and will be titrated up as needed.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine analysis indicates an infection. She has been prescribed ceftriaxone for a 3-day course, which will be completed today. The urine culture will be followed up.

5. Electrolyte Abnormalities:"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of Myasthenia Gravis and recent hospitalization for an exacerbation of her condition. She has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 mmHg to 140/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on digoxin and has a history of allergies to erythromycin base.

The patient's recent events include the change of a pheresis line, staples removal, and a planned CT chest for thoracic surgery. The patient's digoxin dosing has been changed to once daily, and a plan for one more pheresis on April 8th has been made. The patient tolerated a 30-minute spontaneous breathing trial well.

The patient's allergies include an increased infection risk due to erythromycin base. The last dose of antibiotics, ceftriaxone, was given on April 4th at 12:22 AM. 

In terms of infusions, the patient is receiving midazolam at a rate of 5 mg/hour. Other ICU medications include lansoprazole, hydralazine, and heparin"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, now with worsening
   myasthenia flair requiring intubation x 2
   #. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare. Likely related to
   post-operative state. Extubated [**4-2**]. NIF -25 and increasing PCO2
   requiring reintubation. Has been difficult to balance sedation vs
   agitation and discomfort. Requiring high amounts of sedation to keep
   patient calm (otherwise pt starts pulling on the tubes,etc) but can
   become too sedated for NIF checks.  Neurology following.
   - Cont ventilator support until strength improves, wean as tolerated
   - PS trial today
   - Neurology recs: Cont plasmapheresis (2 more pheresis runs, plan for
   pheresis today) per Neuro. Cont to f/u further recs for
   mestinon/steroid dose.
   - Follow qd VC/NIF checks
   - Hold on PT exercises for now until stronger
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation. Has history of afib; not on anticoagulation
   - will change Dig to QOD dosing .
   - follow Dig level
   - Hold Verapamilmetoprolol due to MG flare
   .
   #. Hypertension.
   - Cont enalapril and hyrdalazine, titrate as needed
   - Hold verapamil as above. Holding metoprolol during MG flare (can
   exacerbate MG).
   .
   #. UTI
 U/A indicative of infection. Cultures pending.
   - s/p Ceftriaxone for 3 day (D1 [**4-3**]) course per neuro (cipro can
   worsen MG)
   - F/U Urine culture
   .
   #. Electrolyte abnormalities. Met alk and hypernatremia improved w/
   IVF.
   - Cont maintenance IVF as patient not taking good POs.
   .
   #. Anemia. Had a 4-point Hct drop this AM. Will recheck this afternoon.
   No obvious signs of GIB but not stooling at this time. Will check
   guaiac once pt has a BM.
   .
   #. AAA repair. Successful repair. Vascular surgery following.
   - f/u recs regarding staple removal, post-op care
   .
   #. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 249**]
   - CT surgery evaluating patient for future need for thymectomy
   .
   FEN: TF while intubated, will place on bowel regimen.
   PPX: SC heparin, PPI (change to lansoprazole while intubated)

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently intubated in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure caused by a myasthenia flare. The patient's medical history includes MG, AAA, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, and anemia. She also has electrolyte imbalances such as met alkalosis and hypernatremia.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.1 F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/56 to 140/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is 38, indicating the need for continued ventilatory support.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal limits, hemoglobin level of 8.3 g/dL, blood glucose level of 104 mg/dL, sodium level of 138 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, and creatinine level of 0.8 mg"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient experienced a myasthenia flare post-operatively, leading to respiratory failure and subsequent intubation. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support and is receiving plasmapheresis for MG management. Other medical issues include atrial fibrillation, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and post-operative care following AAA repair. The patient's code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare resulted in respiratory failure, necessitating intubation. Close monitoring and management of respiratory function will be crucial during the weaning process.
2. UTI: The patient's urinalysis indicates signs of infection, suggesting a urinary tract infection. Cultures are pending, and the patient is receiving a three-day course of ceftriaxone as per neurologic recommendations.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has demonstrated metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which have improved with intravenous fluids. Maintenance IVF will continue as the patient is not tolerating oral intake well.
4. Anemia: The patient experienced a significant drop in hemoglobin levels but is now stable. Further evaluation for gastrointestinal bleeding should be conducted, including stool guai"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She required intubation due to worsening myasthenia flare. She has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and a recent AAA repair with a new occurrence of wound hematoma.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to the post-operative state and her myasthenia flare. She is currently receiving ventilator support until her strength improves. Weaning off the ventilator will depend on her ability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently on anticoagulation therapy. She is being continued on digoxin at daily dosing and her digoxin levels will be monitored. Verapamil and metoprolol are being held due to her MG flare.

3. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is being managed with captopril, and hydralazine is being held. Good blood pressure control has been achieved with this regimen.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates infection, and cultures show fecal contamination."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who underwent an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient required intubation due to a myasthenia flare-up and subsequent respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support and receiving plasmapheresis treatment for MG. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare-up led to respiratory failure, necessitating reintubation. She will continue to be on ventilator support until her strength improves.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation but was not on anticoagulation. She is currently on digoxin at daily dosing and will have her digoxin levels monitored.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, for which she will be switched to oral medications (captopril and hydralazine) to be titrated as needed. Verapamil and metoprolol are being held due to the myasthenia flare-up.

4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates infection, which is being treated with ceftriaxone. This medication choice is preferred over ciprofloxacin because the latter can exacerbate myasthenia gravis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and post-operative care for AAA repair. She is also being evaluated for a potential thymectomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare has led to respiratory failure, requiring intubation. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and ventilator support will be necessary until her strength improves.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and consider changing her digoxin to daily dosing while following digoxin levels.
3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and her blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate oral medications.
4. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates an infection, and cultures are pending. Antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on culture results.
5. Electrolyte Abnormalities: The patient has metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia. These electrolyte imbalances"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications and conditions that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely related to her post-operative state and myasthenia flare. She was extubated previously but required reintubation due to increasing negative inspiratory force (NIF) and carbon dioxide levels. She will continue to receive ventilator support until her strength improves, with plans to wean as tolerated. A pressure support trial is planned today.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not currently on anticoagulation. She is being continued on digitalis at daily dosing, with follow-up on digoxin levels. Verapamil and metoprolol are being held due to the myasthenia flare.

3. Hypertension: The patient has hypertension, and her current blood pressure is in the 90s. She will be switched to oral medications (captopril and hydralazine) for now, to be titrated as needed. Verapamil is being held as well.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the provided progress note. The patient started receiving Ancef, a type of antibiotic, through a vascular access due to concerns about seeding the hardware. This treatment will be continued until the groin wound heals. The patient was transitioned to bolus sedation and changed antihypertensives to captopril alone. The review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for any noted below.

The patient's vital signs and hemodynamic monitoring data are available but not specified in the progress note. The respiratory support, fluid balance, and physical examination findings are also not mentioned.

Laboratory results including white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelet count (Plt), creatinine (Cr), troponin (TropT), total carbon dioxide (TCO2), glucose levels, and imaging studies are provided but not detailed.

The patient has an ongoing infection as indicated by the use of antibiotics, and there are concerns about potential complications such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status and disposition are also mentioned but not specified.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient may develop blood clots in the deep veins, particularly in the legs due to immobility and central venous catheters.
2. Stress Ulcers: The patient may be at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum due to critical illness, sedation, and the use of certain medications.
3. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient may develop pneumonia as a result of being on mechanical ventilation. This is a common complication in ICU patients receiving respiratory support."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She developed worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation. The patient has several medical complications including respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, urinary tract infection (UTI), electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, and wound hematoma.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient experienced respiratory failure due to a myasthenia flare, which required reintubation. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 500 mL, RR set at 18, PS of 8 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 68. Her ABG shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 31, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 203.

2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently not on anticoagulation. She is being monitored for any potential complications related to this condition.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is well-controlled with captopril, and verapamil and metoprolol are held due to MG flare.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient's urinalysis indicates an"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She now presents with worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation.

2. The patient experienced respiratory failure due to the myasthenia flare and was reintubated after extubation failed.

3. She has been receiving plasmapheresis treatments for her myasthenia gravis.

4. The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation. She is currently being treated with digoxin.

5. She has hypertension, which is well-controlled with captopril.

6. The patient has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which was treated with ceftriaxone.

7. She has electrolyte abnormalities, including metabolic alkalosis and hypernatremia, which were improved with intravenous fluids. She is now on diuretic therapy.

8. The patient had a drop in hemoglobin levels but is now stable. There are no obvious signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, but stooling at this time is not present. A guaiac test will be done once the patient has a bowel movement.

9. The patient underwent successful AAA repair surgery. A new occurrence of wound hematoma was noted,"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, now with worsening
   myasthenia flair requiring intubation x 2
   #. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare. Likely related to
   post-operative state. Extubated [**4-2**]. NIF -25 and increasing PCO2
   requiring reintubation. Has been difficult to balance sedation vs
   agitation and discomfort.  Neurology following.  Receiving
   plasmapheresis.

   f/u further recs for mestinon/steroid dose.
   - cont Lasix on prn dosing for fluid removal in anticipation of
   possible extubation once plasmapheresis treatments completed, good
   response yesterday to lasix x2 doses.
   - Follow qd VC/NIF checks
   - Hold on PT exercises for now until stronger
   .
   #. Atrial fibrillation. Has history of afib; not on anticoagulation
   - Cont Dig at daily dosing.
   - follow Dig level
   - Hold Verapamilmetoprolol due to MG flare
   .
   #. Hypertension.
   - cont captopril, will d/c hydralazine.  Good BP control.
   - Hold verapamil as above. Holding metoprolol during MG flare (can
   exacerbate MG).
   .
   #. UTI
 U/A indicative of infection. Cultures c/w fecal contamination,
   treated with ceftriaxone.
   - s/p Ceftriaxone for 3 day (D1 [**4-3**]) course per neuro (cipro can
   worsen MG)
   .
   #. Electrolyte abnormalities. Met alk and hypernatremia improved w/
   IVF.  Now on diuretic therapy., goal K+ 4-4.5
   - started on acetazolamide on [**4-7**]
   - will watch K+ level with diuresis and diamox therapy.
   - Cont maintenance IVF as patient not taking good POs.
   .
   #. Anemia. Had 4pt drop three days ago, now stable. No obvious signs of
   GIB but not stooling at this time. Will check guaiac once pt has a BM.
   .
   #. AAA repair. Successful repair. Vascular surgery following.  New
   occurance of wound hematoma,  no intervention at this time
   - cont to monitor wound hematoma for enlargement and infection
   - will measure fibrinogen and plan cryoprecipitate if level low
   - f/u recs, staples removed, post-op care
   .
   #. Myasthenia [**Last Name (un) 249**]
   - f/u neuro recs
   - aggressively replete K, goal 4-4.5
   - CT surgery evaluating patient for future need for thymectomy,  CT
   Chest scan yesterday without events.
   - CT chest sig for no thymoma, bilateral pl effusions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient experienced a worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation twice. She is currently receiving ventilator support and undergoing plasmapheresis treatment.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to the worsening myasthenia flare and post-operative state. Continuous ventilator support is required until her strength improves.

2. Wound hematoma and infection: The patient has a new occurrence of wound hematoma after the AAA repair. Close monitoring for enlargement and infection is necessary. Fibrinogen levels will be measured, and cryoprecipitate may be planned if the level is low.

3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has hypernatremia and metabolic alkalosis, which have improved with intravenous fluids. Diuretic therapy has been started, and potassium levels will be closely monitored.

4. UTI: The patient's urinalysis indicates an infection, and she has been treated with ceftriaxone. Cultures confirm fecal contamination.

5. Anemia: The patient had a significant drop in hemoglobin levels three days ago, but now she is stable. No obvious signs of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) are present, but stooling"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, anxiety, and altered nutrition. He is currently on invasive ventilation, but extubation was attempted and the patient was placed on bipap support overnight due to increased work of breathing. The patient has a nasogastric tube in place and received lasix 10mg iv x1 in the morning. Diamox was discontinued, and the patient's current medications remain unchanged. The patient's allergies include erythromycin base, which can cause increased infections.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be at risk due to prolonged immobility and possible pressure ulcers from lying in one position for extended periods.
2. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety could worsen due to the stressful ICU environment, invasive procedures, and potential discomfort.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which may require careful monitoring and management during his ICU stay.
4. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient's altered nutrition may continue to be a concern, as indicated by his history of anxiety and potential difficulties with eating.
5. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): There is a risk of developing a UTI due to the presence of a urinary catheter, especially if it is left in place for an extended period.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She required intubation due to worsening myasthenia flare and has been experiencing respiratory failure. The patient has also been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and hypertension, both of which are being managed with medication. She developed a urinary tract infection (UTI) and was treated with ceftriaxone. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities have improved with intravenous fluids, and she is now on diuretic therapy. She has anemia and a recent occurrence of wound hematoma following the AAA repair. The patient is currently extubated and receiving noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIF).

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of MG and recent respiratory failure indicate a high risk of recurrent respiratory failure, especially if the underlying cause is not adequately addressed.
2. Wound Hematoma: The occurrence of a wound hematoma after the AAA repair poses a risk of infection and potential complications such as wound dehiscence or abscess formation.
3. UTI: Although the patient has been treated with ceftriaxone, there is still a risk of persistent or recurrent UTI, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. The patient experienced a myasthenia flare and required intubation twice. She is currently extubated and on BIPAP due to increased work of breathing. The patient received plasmapheresis treatment and is being monitored closely by neurology for her MG symptoms.

The patient also has a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) but is not on anticoagulation. She is being monitored for her heart rhythm and is on digoxin with daily dosing. The patient's hypertension is well-controlled with captopril, and verapamil and metoprolol are being held during the MG flare.

There are concerns about electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, AAA repair, and myasthenia gravis. The patient's potassium levels will be closely monitored with diuretic therapy. The anemia is stable at 26.3, and the patient will be monitored for any signs of blood loss. The AAA repair was successful, but there is a new occurrence of wound hematoma. The patient's wound will be closely monitored for any enlargement or infection. 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis measures. The patient's code status is full code, and she will continue to be in"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG), admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation twice. She was on BiPAP overnight and has been extubated since [**2122-4-9**]. The patient has a history of MG, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, and anemia. She underwent successful AAA repair and is being monitored for post-operative complications. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare has led to respiratory failure requiring intubation twice. Close monitoring of respiratory status and oxygenation is necessary.
2. Infection: The patient has a wound hematoma and is at risk for infection. Regular wound assessment and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered.
3. Electrolyte abnormalities: The patient has an ongoing electrolyte imbalance, specifically hypernatremia and hypokalemia. Close monitoring of electrolyte levels and aggressive repletion of potassium is essential.
4. Bleeding: The patient has anemia, which needs to be monitored. Stool occult blood testing should be done to assess for any gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient has a history of AF and may be at risk for further cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous cardiac monitoring and appropriate antiarr"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis, admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She has experienced worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation twice and is currently extubated. The patient received plasmapheresis treatment and was able to breathe better after resting on BiPAP overnight. Neurology recommends continuing Mestinon/steroid dose at this time. Fluid removal with furosemide is also recommended to decrease work of breathing. VC/NIF checks should be followed daily, and BiPAP at night as needed. A speech and swallow consult is also advised.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure due to myasthenia flare: Likely related to the post-operative state. The patient received plasmapheresis treatment and was extubated successfully. Neurology wants to continue Mestinon/steroid dose, follow qd VC/NIF checks, consider BiPAP at night as needed, and obtain a speech and swallow consult.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is not on anticoagulation. It is recommended to continue Dig at daily dosing, follow Dig level, and hold Verapamil and metoprolol due to MG flare.
3. Hypertension: Well-controlled hypertension should be managed by continuing captopril, holding verapamil as above, holding"

   65F with history of MG, admitted for AAA repair, now with worsening
   myasthenia flair requiring intubation x 2. Is currently extubated and
   was on BiPAP overnight.
   #. Respiratory failure [**2-9**] myasthenia flare:
   Likely related to post-operative state. Received plasmapheresis
   treatment [**5-12**] on [**4-8**]. Extubated on [**2122-4-9**] and had some increased work
   of breathing and post-extubation NIF of -22; however, did well after
   being rested on BiPAP overnight.
   - Neurology would like to continue mestinon/steroid dose at this time.
   - Cont furosemide on prn dosing for fluid removal to help decrease work
   of breathing
   - Follow qd VC/NIF checks
   - PT
   - consider BiPAP at night as needed
   - speech and swallow consult
   #. Atrial fibrillation:
   Has history of afib; not on anticoagulation.
   - Cont Dig at daily dosing.
   - Follow Dig level
   - Hold Verapamil and metoprolol due to MG flare
   #. Hypertension:
   Well controlled
   - Cont captopril
   - Hold verapamil as above. Holding metoprolol during MG flare (can
   exacerbate MG).
   - will use PRN hydralazine
   #. Electrolyte abnormalities:
   Met alk and hypernatremia improved w/ IVF.  Now on diuretic therapy.,
   goal K+ 4-4.5
   - Will watch K+ level with diuresis
   #. Anemia:
   Stable. Will monitor stools for occult blood.
   #. AAA repair:
   Successful repair. Vascular surgery following.  New occurance of wound
   hematoma 3 nights ago, no intervention at this time. No expansion of
   hematoma or further opening of wound today.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG) who was admitted for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She is currently in the ICU due to worsening respiratory failure caused by a myasthenia flare-up, which required intubation. She has been extubated and placed on BiPAP overnight. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 158/76 to 199/103 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and temperature within normal range.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs with moderate air movement and evidence of abdominal and sternal cage compensation for respirations. She is awake and responsive, with pupils equal and reactive bilaterally. Her cardiovascular examination is unremarkable, and her neurologic examination shows that she is alert and oriented x3, following commands, and breathing spontaneously.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Her kidney function is within normal limits, but she has mild hyperglycemia. Other lab values, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal range.

The patient's medical history includes MG, AAA repair, atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, and anemia. She is currently on various medications including captopril, metoprolol, lans"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a history of hypertension, who presented to the ICU with altered mental status, fever, and a high systolic blood pressure. He has been receiving treatment for hypertension with medications such as captopril and hydralazine. The patient is also on prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is receiving nutrition through a nasogastric tube and his code status is set to full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility in the ICU.
2. Anxiety: The patient's altered mental status and hospitalization in the ICU can contribute to feelings of anxiety.
3. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, and his current blood pressure readings indicate elevated levels. Proper management of his blood pressure is essential to prevent further complications.
4. Alteration in nutrition: The patient's ability to meet his nutritional needs may be compromised due to impaired swallowing and feeding abilities.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient may be at risk for developing a UTI due to indwelling urinary catheters.
6. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, as there is a possibility of acute renal failure.
7. Airway protection issues: The patient's inability to protect his own"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus type II, and myasthenia gravis. The patient presented with altered mental status and was found to have acute renal failure. He was started on captopril and hydralazine for blood pressure control, and his medications were adjusted accordingly. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and is receiving IV fluids and nutrition. His vital signs show a blood pressure of 158/76 mmHg, heart rate of 94 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient has a history of anxiety, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, urinary tract infection, renal failure, airway protection issues due to myasthenia gravis flare, alteration in elimination related to diarrhea, and hypotonicity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Renal Failure: The patient already has acute renal failure, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for dialysis.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a history of UTI, which can worsen renal function and cause systemic infections.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is still elevated despite medication adjustments, increasing the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of myasthenia gravis (MG), who was admitted for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. She experienced worsening myasthenia flare requiring intubation twice and is currently extubated. The patient underwent plasmapheresis treatment and was successfully repaired for AAA. She has a history of atrial fibrillation but is not on anticoagulation. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure due to a myasthenia flare, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, electrolyte abnormalities, anemia, AAA repair, and myasthenia gravis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's worsening myasthenia flare has led to respiratory failure requiring intubation. Continued monitoring and support with BiPAP as needed will be important to prevent further respiratory compromise.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently not on anticoagulation. It is essential to manage this condition with appropriate medications such as digoxin and closely monitor digoxin levels to prevent complications like thromboembolism.

3. Hypertension: The patient experienced elevated blood pressure, and medication adjustments were made. Close monitoring of blood pressure and consideration of further antihypertensive therapy may be necessary to prevent complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance:"
