","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of post-polio syndrome and gout. He presents with fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath with exertion, spontaneous bleeding episodes, subjective fevers, nausea, vomiting, and blurry vision that has resolved. The patient received platelet and red blood cell transfusions overnight. Neurosurgery recommendations include maintaining blood pressure below 140, repeating head CT today, and performing neurochecks every 2 hours. The patient has allergies to aspirin, nausea/vomiting, and previous antibiotic use. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 mmHg to 143/100 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,600 mL, including 788 mL of intravenous fluids, and an output of 660 mL of urine. Blood product transfusion resulted in a total blood product intake of 1,080 mL. Laboratory results indicate pancytopenia with low white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet (Plt) levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of post-polio syndrome and gout. He presents with fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath on exertion, spontaneous bleeding episodes, subjective fevers, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. The patient has received platelet and red blood cell transfusions overnight. Neurosurgery recommendations include maintaining blood pressure below 140, repeating head CT today, and performing neurochecks every 2 hours. The patient has allergies to aspirin and nausea/vomiting. There have been no changes to the medical and family history. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute/subacute pancytopenia: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and spontaneous bleeding may be related to his pancytopenia (low blood cell counts). Further investigation is needed to determine the cause, which could include acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, marrow replacement by fibrosis or tumor, or viral infection such as HIV.

2. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH): The patient's headache and visual disturbance could be concerning for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. A head CT scan is planned to evaluate this possibility.

3. Gout: Although the patient has a history of gout, there are no active issues related to gout at present. However, the patient is currently on al"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of polio and gout. He presents with fatigue and dizziness, which are likely related to his pancytopenia, a condition characterized by a decrease in all types of blood cells. The patient has been diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells. The patient's blood counts are low, with hemoglobin at 7.0 g/dL, white blood cell count at 1.6 K/uL, and platelet count at 6. He has been transfused with blood products to increase his hemoglobin and platelet levels. The patient's HIV test came back negative, and he has an old infection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The patient's headache and visual disturbances have resolved, and the repeat head CT showed improvement. The patient's gout medication, allopurinol, has been discontinued. He is currently being managed for pancytopenia, prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and repletion of electrolytes. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 48 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/57 to 118/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is expected to be transferred to the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 64-year-old male with a history of polio and gout who presented with fatigue and dizziness. The patient has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The differential diagnosis for acute/subacute pancytopenia includes acute leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, marrow replacement by fibrosis or tumor, or viral infection such as HIV. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, which showed no evidence of leukemia but was concerning for aplastic anemia. The patient has been transfused with blood products to maintain a hemoglobin level of at least 20% and a platelet count of >20,000. Allopurinol was discontinued as it can cause aplastic anemia. HIV testing was negative, and EBV serologies indicated a prior infection. Other pending tests include CMV and parvovirus B19. The patient's headache and visual disturbance have resolved, but there is concern for subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient's gout is currently not active, and allopurinol was discontinued. The patient's electrolytes will be monitored, and they will be maintained on IV fluids. Prophylactic measures include venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with VD boots and stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's code status is full code, and they will be transferred to the [**Location 8332**] service."
