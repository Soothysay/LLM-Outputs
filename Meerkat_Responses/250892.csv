","Summary:
The patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He presented with a lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, likely secondary to rectal ulcers. The patient was initially unstable upon presentation but improved with blood transfusion and intravenous fluids. He has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI bleed: The patient has a history of lower GI bleed and was recently discharged from another hospital for this condition. There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current bleeding episode.
2. Anemia: The patient is likely experiencing anemia due to chronic disease and bleeding. This could lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate a stress response to the GI bleed or an underlying infection.
4. ESRD: The patient has end-stage renal disease and is on hemodialysis three times a week. There may be a need for urgent hemodialysis in the setting of intravenous fluid administration and blood transfusions.
5. DM: The patient has diabetes mellitus, which may require close monitoring of blood glucose levels and management.
6. H/o Strep viridans line infection: The patient has a history of a"

   [**Last Name (un) **] which showed two non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  Initially unstable
   upon presentation to ED with AMS and tachycardia to 130s which improved
   with 2units of emergency release blood and 1LNS.  No active bleeding
   seen on colonoscopy on the morning of [**3-18**], but active bleeding seen
   from 1 ulcer when rescoped in the evening.  2 ulcers now banded and
   clipped.  No further bleeding overnight.  Surgical options not likely
   to be acceptable to this patient.  Biopsies pending.  Cause of
   ulceration unclear.  Could also do CT for ischemia evaluation, however,
   given location, ischemia seems unlikely.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 49-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), diabetes mellitus (DM), a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and schizophrenia. He presented with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to rectal ulcers. The patient had two non-bleeding rectal ulcers seen on a previous colonoscopy, but active bleeding was observed during the evening colonoscopy. The ulcers were banded and clipped, and no further bleeding occurred overnight. Surgical options are not considered acceptable by the patient. Biopsies are pending, and the cause of ulceration remains unclear. 

The patient's vital signs include a heart rate (HR) of 72 bpm, blood pressure (BP) of 160/76 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 98% on room air. Physical examination findings are generally unremarkable, except for decreased hair on the lower extremities (LE) and no edema.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 181 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 11.4 g/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 177 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 7.7 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 137 mEq/L, potassium (K+)"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 yo male with ESRD on HD, DM, h/o CVA, here with lower GI
   bleed, secondary to rectal ulcers.
   .
   1.  GI bleed.  Recently discharged from [**Hospital1 587**] for lower GI bleed.  Had
   [**Last Name (un) **] which showed three non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  Initially unstable
   upon presentation to ED with AMS and tachycardia to 130s which improved
   with 2units of emergency release blood and 1LNS.  No active bleeding
   seen on colonoscopy on the morning of [**3-18**], but active bleeding seen
   from 1 ulcer when rescoped in the evening.  2 ulcers now banded and
   clipped.  No further bleeding overnight.  Surgical options not likely
   to be acceptable to this patient.  Biopsies pending.  Cause of
   ulceration unclear.  Could also do CT for ischemia evaluation, however,
   given location, ischemia seems unlikely.  Hct slowly drifted down
   overnight, could be related to fluid shifts.  Will recheck today.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] in case this is upper
   - [**Hospital1 **] Hcts
   - several units crossed
   - Access: 2 16 guage IVs, Right tunneled HD line, Right power picc
   - GI & surgery both following; will discuss further with GI team the
   cause for these ulcers and what treatment, if any, is appropriate.
   .
   2.  Anemia.  Likely multifactorial due to chronic disease and bleeding.
   - serial hcts
   - active type and cross
   - no Epo per nephrology
   .
   4.  ESRD.  Patient is on HD MWF.  ESRD likely secondary to HTN (DM is

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 49-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus (DM), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension (HTN), schizophrenia, and a recent lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and tachycardia, but improved with blood transfusion and fluid resuscitation. Active bleeding was seen from one of the rectal ulcers during colonoscopy, and two ulcers were banded and clipped. Biopsies were taken for further evaluation.

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 157/109 mmHg, heart rate of 75 bpm, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, but no other significant abnormalities.

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 17.0 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 9.5 g/dL, hematocrit (Hct) of 24.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 191 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 7.7 mg/dL, glucose of 177 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including sodium ("

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 49 yo male with ESRD on HD, DM, h/o CVA, here with lower GI
   bleed, secondary to rectal ulcers.
   .
   1.  GI bleed.  Recently discharged from [**Hospital1 587**] for lower GI bleed.  Had
   [**Last Name (un) **] which showed two non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  Initially unstable
   upon presentation to ED with AMS and tachycardia to 130s which improved
   with 2units of emergency release blood and 1LNS.  No active bleeding
   seen on colonoscopy on the morning of [**3-18**], but active bleeding seen
   from 1 ulcer when rescoped in the evening.  2 ulcers now banded and
   clipped.  No further bleeding overnight.  Surgical options not likely
   to be acceptable to this patient.  Biopsies pending.  Cause of
   ulceration unclear.  Could also do CT for ischemia evaluation, however,
   given location, ischemia seems unlikely.
   - IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] in case this is upper
   - q6 hour Hcts
   - several units crossed
   - Access: 2 16 guage IVs, Right tunneled HD line, Right power picc
   - GI & surgery both following
   .
   2.  Anemia.  Likely multifactorial due to chronic disease and bleeding.
   - serial hcts
   - continue epo
   - type and cross
   - NPO
   .
   4.  ESRD.  Patient is on HD MWF.  ESRD likely secondary to HTN (DM is
   diet controlled).  Last HD session Friday.
   - HD today, renal following
   - continue nephrocaps, zeplar, calcitriol
   .
   5.  DM.  Reportedly has DM, but this diet controlled.
   - follow finger sticks
   - HISS
   .
   6.  H/o Strep viridans line infeciton.  Last day of tx with PCN on
   [**3-18**].
   .
   6. HTN.  On lisinopril at terazon at home.
   - hold antihypertensives in setting of GI bleed and with HD this
   morning
   - if HTN this evening and no further bleeding, can consider low dose
   captopril
   .
   7. Schizophrenia.  Not on any psych meds at baseline.
   .
   8.  H/o CVA.  Was on aggrenox, but held in setting of GI bleed.
   - hold aggrenox
   .
   Ppx: pneumoboots (hold HSQ in setting of bleed).

","The patient is a 49-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, diabetes mellitus (DM), a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and currently admitted with lower gastrointestinal (GI) bleed secondary to rectal ulcers. 

Key findings from the progress note include:
- The patient was initially unstable upon presentation with altered mental status (AMS) and tachycardia in the 130s, which improved with emergency blood transfusion and intravenous fluids.
- Colonoscopy revealed no active bleeding initially but showed active bleeding from one ulcer in the evening.
- Two ulcers were banded and clipped, and no further bleeding was observed overnight.
- Surgical options are not likely to be acceptable to the patient.
- Biopsies of the ulcers are pending.
- The cause of ulceration is unclear, and a CT scan for ischemia evaluation has not been done yet.
- The patient is on IV pantoprazole (proton pump inhibitor) in case this is an upper GI bleed.
- Serial hemoglobin (Hct) checks are planned.
- The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis today.
- The patient's diabetes is reportedly well-controlled.
- The patient has a history of streptococcal viridans line infection, which was treated with penicillin until yesterday.
- The patient has a history of hypertension (HTN) and is currently on lisinopril and terazos"
