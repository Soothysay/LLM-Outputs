   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent an ileocolic resection due to complications from a Meckel's diverticulum. She experienced rebleeding from the anastomosis and small bowel obstruction (SBO), leading to a revision of the anastomosis and lysis of adhesions.

The patient has been intubated electively for a colonoscopy and then surgery. She remains intubated due to fluid resuscitation, concern for volume overload, and a history of being very difficult to intubate. She is currently on pressure support ventilation (PSV) with good respiratory system compliance index (RSBI).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.46, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 33 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 385 mmHg, and oxygen content (O2 content) of 40.6%.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 11.4 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 40.6%, platelet count (Plt)"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent surgery for Meckels diverticulum with ileocolic resection due to bleeding from the anastomosis. She also had small bowel obstruction and required lysis of adhesions and revision of the anastomosis. 

The patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 501 mL, RR of 14, PS of 5 cmH2O, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 38. Her SpO2 is stable at 98%. 

Her vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure within normal limits, and normal respiratory rate. Her temperature is slightly elevated at 36.7°C. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, low albumin levels, and potential volume overload. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include further gastrointestinal bleeding, infection due to prolonged intubation and use of invasive lines, renal dysfunction, and respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia. 

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, hemodynamic status, blood counts, and laboratory results to detect any changes early on. Timely intervention and appropriate management are crucial to prevent further complications and improve the patient"

   from the anastamosis and sbo, now s/p lysis of adhesions and revision
   of anastamosis.
   .
   #. GI bleed/SBP: status post revision of anastamosis, which is likely
   source of GIB, and lysis of adhesions.  VSS and Hct stable after 8
   total U PRBCs. No further bloody BM.
   - trend HCT q8hours, monitor for BRBPR
   - NPO, NGT
   - follow abd exam
   - cipro/flagyl for 1-2 days post-op
   - trend LFTs/[**Doctor First Name **]/lipase (trending down)
   - continue to follow with surgery
   - PCA Dilaudid for pain control
   .
   #. Tachycardia: Pt was initially tachycardic and hypertensive when
   agitated on vent, however continues to be tachycardic to 120s now
   extubated. Is in pain but also somnolent. UOP also decreased over past
   few hours to 20cc/hr.
   - discuss IVFs with surgery and bolus
   .
   #. s/p intubation: electively intubated for colonoscopy, then surgery.
   Remained intubated [**2-22**] fluid resusitation and concern for volume
   overload and h/o being v. difficult intubation. Self extubated this AM
   after sedation weaned. Currently stable resp status on NC.
   .
   #. low albumin: likely due to acute phase lowering.  No known
   underlying liver disease (plus, coags wnl).
   - advance diet when able
   - restart TPN per [**Doctor First Name **] recs
   .
   #. depression: resume paxil after extubated

","The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent an ileocolic resection due to complications from a Meckel's diverticulum. She experienced rebleeding from the anastomosis and small bowel obstruction (SBO), leading to lysis of adhesions and revision of the anastomosis.

The patient has multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. These include:

1. GI bleed/SBP: The patient had a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed post-operation, which was likely caused by the revision of the anastomosis. She received 8 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with a stable hematocrit (Hct). The plan includes monitoring her Hct every 8 hours, watching for bloody stools, and following up with surgery.

2. Tachycardia: The patient initially presented with tachycardia and hypertension when agitated on the ventilator. Even after extubation, she continues to have a heart rate in the 120s. This could be due to pain or sedation. The plan includes discussing intravenous fluids (IVFs) with surgery and providing a bolus if needed.

3. s/p intubation: The patient was electively intubated for a colonoscopy and then surgery. She self-extubated this morning after sedation was weaned. Currently, her respiratory status is stable on the nasal cannula (NC).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent an ileocolic resection with revision of anastomosis due to rebleeding from the anastomosis and small bowel obstruction. She is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's chief complaints include persistent sinus tachycardia, likely due to stress and possible hemorrhage given the drop in hematocrit levels. There is also concern about the actual source of bleeding and the patient's hemodynamic stability.

The patient was initially intubated and ventilated but was extubated at 08:31 AM. She remains tachycardic with a heart rate in the 120s, possibly due to pain and anemia. Her blood pressure is within normal limits. The patient's respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV mode with FiO2 set at 40% and PEEP at 5 cmH2O. She has mild bronchial breath sounds bilaterally.

The patient's abdominal examination reveals distension with a midline incision and minimal serosanguinous discharge. She is also hypotensive and has hypoactive bowel sounds. There is no evidence of edema or calf pain, and her peripheral pulses are intact.

Laboratory results show a significant drop in hematocrit levels from 38% to 32%, then further down to 30%. Other lab values, including white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine"

","Summary:
The patient is a 59-year-old female who underwent an ileocolic resection due to complications from a Meckel's diverticulum. She experienced a rebleed from the anastomosis and small bowel obstruction, leading to an emergency laparotomy. The patient had lysis of adhesions and revision of the anastomosis. Postoperatively, she developed sinus tachycardia, which is likely due to pain and anemia. Her hematocrit (Hct) dropped from 38% to 32% yesterday but remained stable without further transfusion. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 150/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and a temperature of 37.2°C. She is extubated and receiving supplemental oxygen. The patient's abdomen is distended with a midline incision showing serosanguinous discharge. She has mild bronchial breath sounds bilaterally and no calf pain or edema. Her labs show an elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, and normal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits, but she has a slightly elevated lactate level. The plan includes monitoring her Hct every 8 hours, observing for bloody stools or signs of bleeding, and maintaining NPO status with a nasogastric tube. She will continue to be monitored closely by the surgical team. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient had a rebleed from the anastomosis postoperatively. This indicates a risk of ongoing or recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Infection: The patient's elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infection. The presence of serosanguinous discharge from the incision site also raises concerns for wound infection or other sources of infection.
3. Anemia: The drop in Hct from 38% to 32% indicates significant blood loss and ongoing anemia. This could contribute to the patient's tachycardia.
4. Respiratory complications: The patient's mild bronchial breath sounds may suggest underlying pulmonary issues, such as atelectasis or pneumonia, which can be common postoperatively.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and surgical procedures increase the risk of DVT. The patient's extremities should be assessed regularly for signs of swelling or pain, which could indicate a DVT.
6. Malnutrition: The patient is currently NPO and has not received nutritional support. This increases the risk of malnutrition and delayed wound healing. TPN should be restarted as planned.
7. Depression: The patient's history of depression should be addressed, and Paxil should be resumed after extubation to manage her mental health."
