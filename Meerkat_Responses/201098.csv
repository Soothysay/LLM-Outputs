   Disposition:
","The patient is a well-nourished individual who was admitted to the ICU for suspected acute coronary syndrome and later diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and other complications. The patient underwent cardioversion/defibrillation at 05:30 AM and was found to be profoundly hypotensive, requiring Neo and dobutamine infusions. The patient is currently intubated due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 57 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 96/56 mmHg to 175/124 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. The patient is receiving multiple medications including amiodarone, fentanyl, midazolam, phenylephrine, and dobutamine. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the recent events. 

The patient's flow sheet data indicates hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 100%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 36 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.21, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 116, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 60. The patient's physical examination reveals diminished peripheral pulses, symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and crackles at the lung bases. The patient's abdomen is soft, non-tender, and not distended. The patient has trace lower extremity edema. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, decreased hemoglobin (Hct), slightly elevated creatinine (Cr), elevated troponin T, and other abnormal lab values. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ventricular tachycardia. The patient's care plan includes anxiety management, treatment of ventricular tachycardia, and pulmonary edema. The patient's ICU care involves nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   IMAGING:
   [**12-23**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
   moderate ([**1-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
   dysfunction and a low cardiac index. Mild to moderate aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   [**12-23**] CXR:
   Interval worsening of b/l pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of NICMP presents with wide complex
   tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated
   by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Most likely this represents shock, cardiogenic vs
   distributory. Given very low EF, recent VT and multiple shocks,
   cardiogenic seems most likely, although this may be a mixed picture.
   Patient requiring large vasopressor for support
 weaned off neo
   overnight. Spiked T 101.2 overnight, pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- Would consider massive aspiration with chemical pneumonitis and
   resulting in distributive shock component
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   # HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of VT, PE, ARDS from hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, but
   clinical picture is likely multifactorial, chest x-ray with diffuse
   edema and infiltrate in lower left lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- High PEEP requirement has been decreased overnight
   -- Antibiotics as above
   -- repeat CXR this AM
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. Less likely would be
   bundle branch re-entry, also consider rapid SVT with aberrancy such as
   1:1 flutter.
   - Continue amiodarone IV drip after 150 bolus, beta-blocker
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - Consider cath, ICD pending further evaluation
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - Serial biomarkers and ECGs
   - ASA 325
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Hold b-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension
   - pt is auto-diuresing, Lasix gtt stopped overnight
   - Obtain outside records
   # Alcohol: No current signs withdrawal although anxious. CIWA scale.

   IMAGING:
   [**12-23**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
   moderate ([**1-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
   dysfunction and a low cardiac index. Mild to moderate aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   [**12-23**] CXR:
   Interval worsening of b/l pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of NICMP presents with wide complex
   tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated
   by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Most likely this represents shock, cardiogenic vs
   distributory. Given very low EF, recent VT and multiple shocks,
   cardiogenic seems most likely, although this may be a mixed picture.
   Patient requiring large vasopressor for support
 weaned off neo
   overnight. Spiked T 101.2 overnight, pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- Would consider massive aspiration with chemical pneumonitis and
   resulting in distributive shock component
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   # HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of VT, PE, ARDS from hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, but
   clinical picture is likely multifactorial, chest x-ray with diffuse
   edema and infiltrate in lower left lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- High PEEP requirement, need to decrease as possible to maximize
   preload
   -- Antibiotics as above
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. Less likely would be
   bundle branch re-entry, also consider rapid SVT with aberrancy such as
   1:1 flutter.
   - Continue amiodarone IV drip after 150 bolus, beta-blocker
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - Consider cath, ICD pending further evaluation
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - Serial biomarkers and ECGs
   - ASA 325
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - [**Last Name (un) 10495**]-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension
   - Diurese for pulmonary edema component, will start lasix drip.
   - Obtain outside records
   # Alcohol: No current signs withdrawal although anxious. CIWA scale.
   Tox screen.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of NICMP (not specified) presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical condition. 

The patient has several medical complications that can arise based on the information provided in the progress note. These potential complications include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient has a very low ejection fraction (EF 20%), indicating severe systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle. This low EF, along with recent episodes of ventricular tachycardia and multiple shocks, suggests that cardiogenic shock may be the most likely cause of the patient's hypotension. The need for large vasopressor support also supports this diagnosis.

2. Distributive shock: The presence of pulmonary edema and infiltrates on chest X-ray may suggest a component of distributive shock, possibly due to massive aspiration with chemical pneumonitis. This type of shock is characterized by widespread dilation of arterioles and capillaries, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance and hypotension.

3. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure, indicated by the need for invasive ventilation, may progress to ARDS. This condition is characterized by severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging, and the presence of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

4. Ventricular arrhythmias:"

   IMAGING:
   [**12-23**] ECHO:
   The left atrium is markedly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses
   are normal. The left ventricular cavity is severely dilated. There is
   severe global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 10-15%). The
   estimated cardiac index is depressed (<2.0L/min/m2). No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
   The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
   are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild to
   moderate ([**1-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets
   are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+)
   mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
   hypertension. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe global systolic
   dysfunction and a low cardiac index. Mild to moderate aortic
   regurgitation. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary
   hypertension.
   [**12-23**] CXR:
   Interval worsening of b/l pulmonary infiltrates consistent with edema.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of NICMP presents with wide complex
   tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated
   by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Most likely this represents shock, cardiogenic vs
   distributory. Given very low EF, recent VT and multiple shocks,
   cardiogenic seems most likely, although this may be a mixed picture.
   Patient requiring large vasopressor for support
 weaned off neo
   overnight. Spiked T 101.2 overnight, pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- Would consider massive aspiration with chemical pneumonitis and
   resulting in distributive shock component
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   # HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of VT, PE, ARDS from hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, but
   clinical picture is likely multifactorial, chest x-ray with diffuse
   edema and infiltrate in lower left lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- High PEEP requirement has been decreased overnight
   -- Antibiotics as above
   -- repeat CXR this AM
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. Less likely would be
   bundle branch re-entry, also consider rapid SVT with aberrancy such as
   1:1 flutter.
   - Continue amiodarone IV drip after 150 bolus, beta-blocker
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - Consider cath, ICD pending further evaluation
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - Serial biomarkers and ECGs
   - ASA 325
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Hold b-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension
   - pt is auto-diuresing, Lasix gtt stopped overnight
   - Obtain outside records
   # Alcohol: No current signs withdrawal although anxious. CIWA scale.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of NICMP presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. He is in critical condition. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's low ejection fraction (EF) of 20% indicates severe global systolic dysfunction, which may lead to cardiogenic shock. This is supported by the requirement of large vasopressor support.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is on invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, possibly secondary to flash pulmonary edema, aspiration pneumonia, or ARDS from hypotension. 

3. Infection: The patient has a fever of 101.4°F and has been pan-cultured. This suggests a possible infection, and further evaluation of blood, urine, and sputum cultures is pending.

4. Arrhythmias: The patient had wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and it was cardioverted. There is also mention of considering rapid supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrancy or bundle branch re-entry.

5. Coronary artery disease: The patient has a low suspicion of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to refusal of past catheterization and unknown coronary anatomy. Serial biomarkers"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of NICMP (Non-Infective Cardiomyopathy) who presents with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is in critical condition.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which may be due to cardiogenic shock or distributory shock. Given the patient's low ejection fraction (EF), recent ventricular tachycardia, and multiple shocks, cardiogenic shock seems most likely. However, a mixed picture cannot be excluded. The patient requires three pressor medications to maintain adequate blood pressure. It is important to continue dobutamine, levophed, and vasopressin, weaning them as tolerated.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has low oxygen levels, which could be caused by flash pulmonary edema in the setting of ventricular tachycardia, pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, or a combination of these factors. The chest X-ray shows diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in the lower left lobe. Ventilation should be managed according to ARDS protocol, FIO2 should be weaned as tolerated, PEEP requirement should be maintained at 11, and"

   IMAGING:
   [**12-24**] CXR
   Pulmonary vascular re-distribution and patchy b/l lower lobe
   infiltrates increased compared to prior. Predominant appearance is that
   of pulm edema, but an underlying infectious infiltrate cannot be
   excluded.
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of NICMP presents with wide complex
   tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated
   by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Most likely this represents shock, cardiogenic vs
   distributory. Given very low EF, recent VT and multiple shocks,
   cardiogenic seems most likely, although this may be a mixed picture. Pt
   continues to have 3 pressor requirement. Spiked T 102 overnight,
   pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn, Cipro added for double Pseudomonal coverage,
   as pt continued to spike overnight
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   # HYPOXIA: Differential diagnosis includes flash pulmonary edema in
   setting of VT, PE, ARDS from hypotension, aspiration pneumonia, but
   clinical picture is likely multifactorial, chest x-ray with diffuse
   edema with likely underlying infiltrate in lower left lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- PEEP requirement at 11, continue to wean prn
   -- Antibiotics as above
   -- repeat CXR this AM
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. Less likely would be
   bundle branch re-entry, also consider rapid SVT with aberrancy such as
   1:1 flutter.
   - Continue amiodarone IV drip 0.5mcg/min
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - cath, ICD when stable
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - Serial biomarkers and ECGs

   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Hold b-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension

   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr. [**Known lastname 10520**] [**Last Name (Titles) 10521**] to require aggressive presssor support to
   maintain BPs making sepsis and ARDS likely. Additionally, his O2
   requirements are higher than yesterday. Echo over the weekend
   demonstrated an EF of 10% with 2-3+ MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] continues to spike temps to
   102. WBC ct down from 16.2 to 13.2. Sputum reveals GNR, isolate
   pending. Creat down from 2.9 to 2.6. CXR demonstrates a worsening
   infiltrate in the RLL. We will continue Dobuta at 5 mcg/kg/min as well
   as Levo and Vasopressin. to maintaining CO and BP. We will continue
   Vanco, Zosyn and Cipro for pneumonia and sepsis and follow culture
   results. VT remains quiet on Amio 0.5mg/min drip and we will ask EP if
   we are to continue this IV or switch to PO. His family was present for
   rounds this am and are very aware of his very sick condition. We have
   received notes from Dr[**Name (NI) 10522**] office outlining Mr [**Known lastname 10520**]'
   failure to follow-up as an outpatient because as his wife states, he
   didn't want to hear bad news.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 9699**] and [**Doctor Last Name 2506**].

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of NICMP (not specified), presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT), complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. He is currently in critical condition in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient continues to have low blood pressure, requiring multiple pressor medications (dobutamine, levo, vasopressin). This could indicate cardiogenic shock or distributive shock, possibly secondary to sepsis.
2. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing difficulty in maintaining adequate oxygenation, as indicated by a low PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Possible causes include flash pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism (PE), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), aspiration pneumonia, and underlying lung infection.
3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient's initial presentation included wide complex tachycardia consistent with VT, which was cardioverted. There is a concern for recurrent VT, and the patient is receiving amiodarone IV drip.
4. Sepsis: The patient's fever, elevated white blood cell count, and positive sputum cultures suggest an underlying infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs to be identified and treated appropriately.
5. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The worsening infiltrates on chest X"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, which has now complicated into profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is in critical condition.

The patient has been receiving multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure, including dobutamine, levophed, and vasopressin. He continues to spike with a fever of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood cultures have been taken, showing pan-culture results.

The patient has been diagnosed with pulmonary edema, ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and pneumonia. He is currently on mechanical ventilation according to the ARDS protocol. Antibiotics have been started, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin.

The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 41 on admission to 29 currently, which may be due to dilutional anemia or potential hemolysis. Further investigation is needed to rule out hemolysis.

The patient experienced a rapid ventricular tachycardia that was cardioverted, but persistent PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) are still present. Amiodarone has been initiated for arrhythmia management.

The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction is"

 Progression of the left retrocardiac opacity that probably

   consolidation, which may represent either atelectasis or infection
   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presents with
   wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now
   complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in
   critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Cardiogenic vs septic shock. Pt continues to have 3
   pressor requirement. Continues to spike to T 102, pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn / Cipro, currently day 4
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   -- IVF if decr in pressure, as CVP is low
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial
 Pulmonary edema, ARDS, PNA. Chest x-ray
   with diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in lower left
   lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- PEEP requirement at 15, continue to wean prn
   -- Antibiotics as above
   -- repeat CXR in AM
   # ANEMIA: Pt with decreasing HCT from 41 on admission to 29 currently.
   Partially dilutional, but should rule out hemolysis.
   - hemolysis labs
   - monitor HCT
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. No further episodes of VT.
   Has persistent PVCs.
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week (started [**2124-12-25**]), then 400mg
   daily
   - restart Amio gtt 0.5mg if increase in ectopy
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - cath, ICD when stable
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - ASA 325
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Hold b-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension
   - pt is auto-diuresing, consider IVF bolus if UOP decr
   # Alcohol: No current signs withdrawal although anxious and on Midaz
   while on vent.
   - CIWA scale when off Midaz.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**] Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10520**] had decreased O2 and pressor requirements yesterday
   afternoon but again required 100% FiO2 and 15mm Hg PEEP this am. BPs
   also dropped this am as well. Amiodorone has been changed to 400 mg NGT
   [**Hospital1 **]. BP 99/53 on three pressors. Vigileo shows CI of 2.3 and SVR of
   800-900 on three pressors pointing to a mixed picture of cardiogenic
   and septic shock. We will continue Dobutamine, vasopressin and Levofed
   for now to support CO and BP. Vanco, Zosyn and Cipro are D#4. We will
   watch for breakthrough VT and he will need an ICD if he recovers from
   his gravely ill state.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with wide complex tachycardia, now complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. He is on multiple pressors to maintain blood pressure and has been treated with antibiotics for suspected infection.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 102.1°F, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/53 mmHg to 75/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 100% FiO2. The patient's cardiac rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 10.0 g/dL, elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 48 mg/dL, elevated creatinine level of 2.3 mg/dL, and elevated lactate acid level of 1.2 mmol/L. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits.

Imaging studies reveal a progression of the left retrocardiac opacity, which represents a combination of pulmonary edema and previously present consolidation. This may indicate either atelectasis or infection.

The patient's medical conditions include cardiogenic shock, septic shock, anemia, vent"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presents with
   wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now
   complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in
   critical condition.
   .
   # HYPOTENSION: Cardiogenic vs septic shock. Pt continues to have 3
   pressor requirement. Continues to spike to T 102, pan-cultured.
   -- Continue Dobutamine, Levophed, and Vasopressin, wean as tolerated
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn / Cipro
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   -- MAP goal > 60
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial
 Pulmonary edema, ARDS, PNA. Chest x-ray
   with diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in lower left
   lobe.
   -- Vent per ARDS protocol
   -- Wean FIO2 as tolerated
   -- PEEP requirement at 15, continue to wean prn
   -- Antibiotics as above
   -- repeat CXR this AM
   # ANEMIA: Pt with decreasing HCT from 41 on admission to 29 currently.
   Partially dilutional, but should rule out hemolysis.
   - hemolysis labs
   - monitor HCT
   - consider transfusion
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. No further episodes of VT.
   Has persistent PVCs.
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, then 400mg daily
   - Replete K>4, Mg>2
   - Telemetry
   - cath, ICD when stable
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - ASA 325
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os
   - Hold b-blocker, ACE inhibitor in setting of hypotension
   - pt is auto-diuresing, consider Lasix gtt if UOP decr
   - Obtain outside records
   # Alcohol: No current signs withdrawal although anxious and on Midaz
   while on vent.
   - CIWA scale when off Midaz.

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I have also reviewed the notes of Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**] Pride.
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10520**] had decreased O2 and pressor requirements yesterday
   afternoon but again required 100% FiO2 and 15mm Hg PEEP this am. BPs
   also dropped this am as well. Amiodorone has been changed to 400 mg NGT
   [**Hospital1 **]. BP 99/53 on three pressors. Vigileo shows CI of 2.3 and SVR of
   800-900 on three pressors pointing to a mixed picture of cardiogenic
   and septic shock. We will continue Dobutamine, vasopressin and Levofed
   for now to support CO and BP. Vanco, Zosyn and Cipro are D#4. We will
   watch for breakthrough VT and he will need an ICD if he recovers from
   his gravely ill state.
   Above discussed extensively with family member, next of [**Doctor First Name 23**] or health
   care proxy. I have discussed this plan with Dr(s). [**Name (NI) 2506**] and Pride.
   Total time spent on patient care: 40 minutes of critical care time.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in critical condition.

The patient's vital signs indicate a fever of 102.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 97/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on 70% FiO2. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 460 mL, respiratory rate set at 22 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 30 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 25 cmH2O, and compliance of 46 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 11.4 K/uL, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 48 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.7 mg/dL, glucose of 159 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.22.

   Medical Decision Making
   Mr [**Known lastname 10520**] remains intubated with less O2 requirements now. He is on
   PS at the current time and tolerating it well. CXR is not improved with
   CHF and underlying pneumonia. He put out 1 L in the past 24 hrs with
   Lasix. Nursing says his secretions are better. He is off dobutamine due
   to NSVT and off pressors as well with adequate BP. He is afebrile and
   RSBI was 30 this am all factors favoring extubation. Will give him a
   SBT then extubate this am. Add lopressor 12.5mg TID. Continue Vanco,
   zosyn, cipro Day #6 of 10 for vent assoc pneumonia. Have discussed the
   plan in detail with the family.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient has been in critical condition.

The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including hypotension, which has resolved and the patient is now off pressors. There is also ongoing concern for hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and potential pneumonia. The patient's sputum gram stain was initially positive for multiple organisms but no growth on culture, and subsequent sputum gram stain and culture were negative.

The patient is anemic with decreasing hematocrit from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Hemolysis labs were negative on 12-26. The patient had a rate near 300 bpm after cardioversion with extreme axis and concordance, making it most likely to be VT. No further episodes of VT were observed, but the patient has persistent PVCs. Do butamine was discontinued due to decrease in ectopy.

The patient's coronary arteries have low suspicion for ACS. The patient refused cath in the past, and unknown coronary anatomy exists. Initial enzymes were negative. The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is 20%, likely mildly volume overloaded presently. It is unclear if the cardiomyopathy is ischemic, alcoholic,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, who presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia, profound hypotension, and respiratory failure. He is currently in critical condition in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient had resolved hypotension but was previously on pressors. It is important to monitor his blood pressure and continue with appropriate treatment to maintain adequate blood pressure.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and possible PNA. Chest X-ray shows diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in the lower left lobe. Oxygen saturation is good on PSV. An SBT today may likely lead to extubation.
3. Anemia: The patient's HCT is decreasing from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Hemolysis labs are negative. It is important to monitor HCT levels.
4. Wide Complex Tachycardia (WCT): The patient had a rate near 300 bpm after cardioversion, which is most likely ventricular tachycardia (VT). No further episodes of VT have occurred, but persistent PVCs are present. TSH is normal. Metoprolol and amiodarone have been started for rate control and rhythm management.
5. Coronaries: There is low suspicion"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, and now has profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is in critical condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which could be due to cardiogenic or septic shock. Septic component appears to be resolving as the patient is now off pressors and afebrile. However, there is a concern for ongoing hypotension, and the goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be greater than 60.
2. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia, including pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and potential pneumonia (PNA). The chest X-ray shows diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in the lower left lobe. Ventilation support per ARDS protocol should be continued, and the FiO2 should be weaned as tolerated. PEEP requirement at 12 should be continued, and the possibility of underlying PNA should be considered.
3. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit (HCT) has decreased from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Hemolysis labs are negative, but further evaluation for anemia may be necessary.
4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient had"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, resolved with the help of medications; hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and possible pneumonia; anemia with decreasing hematocrit from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently; and worsening of right basilar opacities on chest x-ray, indicating evolution of pulmonary edema.

The patient has been treated with various medications such as metoprolol, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, dobutamine, furosemide, and midazolam. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 129/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's worsening right basilar opacities on chest x-ray suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotics accordingly is important.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's diffuse edema and lower left lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray indicate AR"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presents with
   wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now
   complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure, in
   critical condition.
   # HYPERTENSION: Hypotension now resolved.  Pt is now off pressors and
   has been afebrile. Has been hypertensive which his baseline.  He also
   has history of anxiety and may be going through ETOH withdrawl.
   -- metoprolol 50tid
   -- start ACEI
   -- continue Vanco / Zosyn / Cipro, currently day [**7-21**]
   -- f/u Blood, urine cultures, sputum
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial
 Pulmonary edema, ARDS, PNA. Chest x-ray
   with diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in lower left
   lobe.  First sputum had gram stain positive for multiple organisms, but
   no growth on culture.  2nd sputum gram stain and culture negative to
   date. Satting well on PS this AM. RSBI 11.
   - not tolerating vent well, sedation causes hypotension, and requires
   high levels of sedation not to override the vent.  Has abnormally high
   tidal volumes which may represent his baseline per history from wife.
   Would give trial SBT and extubate today if tolerated for 15-20 minutes.
   -- Antibiotics as above

   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. No further episodes of VT.
   Has persistent PVCs. Dobutamine discontinued with decrease in ectopy.
   TSH 1.0 on [**2124-12-23**].  Continues to have PVCs but not NSVT.
   - continue metoprolol
   - Continue amiodarone 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week (started [**2124-12-25**]), then 400mg
   daily
   - increase amio to 0.5ggt if sustained VT

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
- He presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia, profound hypotension, and respiratory failure.
- The patient has been in critical condition and has multiple medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive, which is a concern. It is important to monitor and manage his blood pressure to prevent complications such as stroke or heart attack.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia. Close monitoring of oxygen levels and appropriate respiratory support are necessary to prevent further deterioration.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has been decreasing from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Monitoring the patient's HCT and investigating the cause of anemia is important to prevent complications related to reduced oxygen-carrying capacity.

4. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient had a recent episode of VT, which was cardioverted. Continued monitoring for recurrent VT and managing underlying risk factors are essential to prevent life-threatening arrhythmias.

5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Although the suspicion for ACS is low,"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, accompanied by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient has shown some improvement as his hypertension has resolved and he is now off pressors. However, he still requires sedation to tolerate the ventilator. His blood cultures have been positive for multiple organisms, but no growth has been observed on the culture. The patient's sputum gram stain was initially positive but later became negative.

The patient's hemoglobin levels have decreased from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Hemolysis labs have been negative. He continues to have PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) but not NSVT (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia). His thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is normal.

The patient has a low suspicion of ACS (acute coronary syndrome) and refused catheterization in the past. His initial enzymes were negative. He is prescribed ASA 325 and will undergo catheterization when stable.

His left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is estimated to be 20%, indicating a compromised pumping function. The cause of his cardiomyopathy is unclear, possibly due to ischemia, alcohol consumption, or idiopathic factors."

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, now complicated by profound hypotension and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in critical condition.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which is currently being managed with metoprolol. It is important to monitor blood pressure regularly and adjust medication as needed to prevent complications related to high blood pressure.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and PNA. The chest x-ray shows diffuse edema with likely underlying infiltrate in the lower left lobe. Sputum gram stain was positive for multiple organisms, but no growth on culture. The patient is tolerating PS well, with a recent RSBI of 11. Antibiotics are being continued, and a repeat chest x-ray will be done in the morning. Lasix is being given for diuresis, aiming for an output of -1.5-2L.

3. Anemia: The patient has a decreasing hematocrit from 41 on admission to 29.9 currently. Hemolysis labs were negative on 12/26. Monitoring hematocrit levels will be important to assess for ongoing blood loss or other causes of anemia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, which was consistent with ventricular tachycardia. The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress and has been experiencing increasing white blood cell count, persistent fevers, and delirium.

Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia, including pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia (PNA). Despite diuresis and clinical euvolemia, the chest x-ray shows diffuse bilateral infiltrates.
2. Fever and Leukocytosis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an ongoing infectious process despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other potential causes of fever and leukocytosis include pyelonephritis, diverticulitis, referred pain from right-sided PNA, cholecystitis, autoimmune diseases, drug fever, and malignancy.
3. Right Flank Pain: The patient's new right-sided flank pain could be due to muscle strain, hepatic inflammation (suggested by new transaminitis), nephrolithiasis. Transaminitis could be caused by infectious, drug effect (from amiodarone and Zosyn), hepatic vein thrombosis, underlying cirrhosis, or congestive"

","The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, presenting with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He was admitted due to profound hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient's current condition includes persistent fevers, leukocytosis, and delirium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), blood pressure ranging from 141/78 mmHg to 97/50 mmHg, heart rate between 88-91 bpm, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. His general appearance is agitated and pulling at lines.

The physical examination reveals rhonchi throughout the lungs, soft abdomen without tenderness, warm and well-perfused extremities, and a Foley catheter in place with dark-colored urine. The patient's chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, moderate-severe, unchanged from previous days. There are widespread parenchymal opacities consistent with combination of partially resolved pulmonary edema and multifocal consolidation, worrisome for an infectious process. No appreciable pleural effusion is noted.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit decreasing from 41% on admission to 29.9% currently, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated pancreatic enzymes, elevated bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   60 year old man with history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presents with
   wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
   Hospital course cx by profound hypotension and respiratory distress
   requiring intubation.  Now with increasing WBC, persistent fevers and
   new right sided flank pain
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial
 Pulmonary edema, ARDS, PNA. Chest x-ray
   with diffuse edema, relatively unchanged despite significant diuresis.
   First sputum had gram stain positive for multiple organisms, but no
   growth on culture.  2nd sputum gram stain and culture negative to date.
   Saturations better after suctioning thick secretions and sitting
   patient up in bed.  ABG prior to suctioning suggest primary hypoxemia
   with ventilatory defect (normal CO2)

   #Fever, leukocytosis
 suggest infectious process despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics for VAP.  Pt not immunocompromised so unlikely to
   have opportunistic infection.  With new right sided flank pain would
   consider c. diff, pyelonephritis, diverticulitis, referred pain from R
   sided PNA (unlikely with CXR findings), cholecystitis

   -- RUQ US
   -- consider abdominal CT if sx do not improve and respiratory status
   stabilizes
   # R flank pain: Differential Dx: muscle strain, hepatic inflammation
   (suggested by new transaminitis), nephrolithiasis.  Transaminitis could
   be infectious, drug effect (on amiodarone, zosyn), hepatic vein
   thrombosis, underlying cirrhosis, congestive from fluid overload
   -- RUQ U/S with dopplers to assess for cholecystitis, underlying
   cirrhosis, vein thrombosis, other hepatic pathology
   -- repeat U/A

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, who presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He required intubation due to profound hypotension and respiratory distress. His hospital course has been complicated by fever, leukocytosis, persistent hypoxia, and new right-sided flank pain.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C (101.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 141/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. His heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST), elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase), and abnormal renal function tests. Imaging studies reveal a patent hepatic vein/portal vein, coarse liver echotexture suggestive of diffuse hepatic disease and cirrhosis, and a 1 cm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, which may represent a hemangioma.

The patient's chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly and widespread parenchymal opacities, most consistent with a combination of partially resolved pulmonary edema and multifocal consolidation worrisome for an infectious process. Microbiology tests are negative for Clostridium difficile.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, presenting with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He has been hospitalized and is currently in the ICU. The patient's clinical course includes profound hypotension, respiratory distress requiring intubation, increasing white blood cell count, persistent fevers, and delirium. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.8°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 141/78 mmHg to 97/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation and is receiving high-flow nasal cannula oxygen.

Physical examination findings include agitation and pulling at lines, clear lungs with rhonchi throughout, soft abdomen without tenderness, warm and well-perfused extremities, and trace edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated pancreatic enzymes (amylase/lipase), and abnormal renal function tests. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a patent hepatic vein and portal vein, coarse liver texture suggestive of diffuse hepatic disease and cirrhosis, and a 1 cm echogenic lesion in the right lobe of the liver possibly representing a hemangioma.

Radiology findings include a chest X-ray showing cardiomegaly and widespread parench"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-inch tall male weighing 99.8 kg, admitted to the ICU with chief complaints of flank pain and desaturation to the 80s, especially when on the left side. The patient's CXR shows relatively unchanged findings with improved oxygenation upon suctioning. The patient also exhibits new right-sided flank pain and transaminitis, with unremarkable KUB and nonspecific liver changes on RUQ US. Additionally, the patient has d/c'd amiodarone, resulting in new transaminitis and elevated pancreatic enzymes. The patient was agitated and pulling at lines, oriented x 2, and required repeated doses of olanzipine for agitation and ativan for possible ICU psychosis. The patient's b-blocker was titrated up to 75 mg TID in am.

Medical Complications:
1. Delirium/confusion: The patient's agitation and pulling at lines, along with repeated doses of agitation medication, indicate a potential delirium or confusion.
2. Pain control: The patient's complaints of flank pain, both acute and chronic, suggest a need for pain management.
3. Alcohol withdrawal (including delirium tremens, DTS, seizures): There is no direct evidence of alcohol withdrawal, but it should be considered given the patient's history and symptoms.
4. Cardiomyopathy, other: The patient's cardiac status should be evaluated further due to the presence of cardiomegaly on"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy, presenting with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He experienced profound hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and PNA. He also has occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein above and below the elbow, extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcifications, and possible malignancy that cannot be excluded. The patient has been on various medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, heparin, lorazepam, and famotidine. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infectious process: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive sputum gram stain suggest an ongoing infectious process despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Further evaluation of blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinalysis is recommended.
2. Aspiration pneumonitis: Given the bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs seen on CT torso, the patient may have aspiration pneumonitis.
3. Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein above and below the elbow indicates a"

- The patient has been hospitalized and experienced profound hypotension and respiratory distress, requiring intubation.
- He has had increasing WBC, persistent fevers, and delirium.
- The patient has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, ARDS, and pneumonia (PNA).
- A CT torso showed bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs, suggesting multifocal vs aspiration PNA; extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcifications - possibly reactive or malignancy.
- The patient has an occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein above and below the elbow, for which heparin drip was started.
- Blood cultures are pending.
- The patient's condition suggests an infectious process despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Other potential diagnoses include pyelonephritis, diverticulitis, referred pain from right-sided PNA (unlikely with CXR findings), cholecystitis.
- Noninfectious etiologies for fever of unknown origin (FUO) include autoimmune diseases, drug fever, malignancy.
- The patient's right flank pain may be due to muscle strain, hepatic inflammation (suggested by new trans"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He was admitted to the ICU due to wide complex tachycardia, which was consistent with ventricular tachycardia. The patient experienced profound hypotension and respiratory distress, requiring intubation. His hospital course has been complicated by several medical complications, including a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, delirium, transminitis, anemia, and ongoing fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Process: The patient's persistent fevers and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infectious process despite being on broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection, including blood cultures, sputum cultures, and urinalysis.

2. Right Upper Extremity DVT: The patient has an occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein above and below the elbow. Heparin drip has been initiated for anticoagulation, and close monitoring is required to prevent further clot progression or embolization.

3. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs. This indicates multifocal versus aspiration pneumonia. Extensive mediastinal and hilar"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current assessment, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing a fever, with a recorded temperature of 101.8 degrees Celsius. This could be indicative of an infection or another underlying condition.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is exhibiting signs of delirium and confusion, which may be due to various factors such as medication side effects, alcohol withdrawal, or other causes.

3. Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT, a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the legs. Prolonged immobility, such as in an ICU setting, can increase the risk of clot formation.

4. Pain Control: The patient is experiencing both acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to ensure comfort and prevent further complications.

5. Cardiomyopathy: The patient may have an underlying cardiac condition, as indicated by the assessment of cardiomyopathy. This could contribute to symptoms like shortness of breath or irregular heart rhythms.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity may be compromised due to prolonged bed rest or other factors. This can increase the risk of pressure ulcers or infections.

7. Alteration in Nutrition: The patient may have an altered nutritional status, which could be a result of decreased oral intake"

","Summary:
The patient is a [age]-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status, difficulty speaking, and swallowing. The patient was made NPO except for medications given as nectar-thickened liquids. The patient has been started on meropenem 500mg IV q8h, sputum gram stain and culture, and ruled out for influenza. The Foley catheter is to be discontinued when feasible, and a repeat urinalysis/urology consult is pending. If loose stool is present, it will be sent for C. difficile toxin and coverage will be started empirically while awaiting results. Pulmonary follow-up has been staffed, and a repeat CT scan in 6 weeks to 3 months is agreed upon. Antibiotic coverage with [**Last Name (un) 350**] is also checked, along with checking ACE to rule out sarcoid. The patient's temperature has been spiking, reaching 101°F at 8 p.m. and 101.8°F at 2:30 a.m. The patient was agitated and received Ativan 4mg and Valium 10mg. Oral thrush started nystatin. The patient has no known drug allergies. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin on 12/30/24 at 11:45 PM, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 12/31/24 at 11:56 PM, piperacillin on 01/01/25 at 04:25 PM, vancomycin on 01/01/25 at 09:30 PM, meropenem on 01/01/25 at 10:36 PM, and metronidazole on 01/02/25 at 03:14 AM. The patient is currently on heparin sodium at 1,750 units/hour. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid) on 01/01/25 at 09:09 AM, diazepam (Valium) on 01/01/25 at 10:34 PM, and lorazepam (Ativan) on 01/02/25 at 03:24 AM. Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The patient's vital signs include a maximum temperature of 101.8°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 130/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on high flow neb. The patient is on sinus rhythm and weighs 94.2 kg (98.2 kg at admission). Fluid balance shows a total in of 1,781 mL, with 90 mL taken orally, 1,691 mL infused intravenously, and 388 mL output via blood products. The patient has received 2,240 mL of blood products"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. 

1. Fever: The patient's temperature has been consistently above normal limits, indicating an ongoing infection or inflammatory process. This needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is displaying signs of delirium or confusion, which may be related to their current medical condition or potential drug interactions. It is important to assess the mental status regularly and consider adjusting medication doses accordingly.

3. Pain: The patient is experiencing both acute and chronic pain, which requires appropriate pain management to improve comfort and overall well-being.

4. DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis): There is a suspicion of DVT in the upper extremity, as indicated by the erythematous and tender right first metatarsal. Further investigations, such as venous ultrasound or other imaging modalities, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

5. Alcohol Withdrawal: The patient's history suggests a possibility of alcohol withdrawal, which can lead to severe complications like seizures or delirium tremens. Close monitoring and appropriate pharmacological interventions are crucial in such cases.

6. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient's skin integrity is compromised, likely due to prolonged bedridden status or other factors. Proper skincare protocols should be implemented to prevent further skin breakdown.

7. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly secondary to their underlying condition. Oxygen supplementation and other supportive"

   wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia.
   Hospital course cx by profound hypotension and respiratory distress
   requiring intubation.  Now with increasing WBC, persistent fevers and
   delirium
   # HYPOXIA: Multifactorial
 Pulmonary edema, ARDS, PNA. Chest x-ray
   with diffuse bilateral inflitrates, relatively unchanged despite
   significant diuresis and clinical euvolemia by exam.  First sputum had
   gram stain positive for multiple organisms, but no growth on culture.
   Subsequent sputum cultures negative. Saturations better after
   suctioning thick secretions and sitting patient up in bed. CT torso
   with bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs,
   c/w multifocal vs aspiration PNA; extensive mediastinal and hilar LAD
   with calcifications - ? reactive vs malignancy.
   -- continue Vanco day [**11-25**] and meropenem as per ID recommendation
   -- f/u ACE to r/o sarcoid
   -- f/u sputum for cytology
   -- frequent suctioning to remove secretions
   -- continue nebs prn
   -- consider PE if respiratory status does not improve
   -- repeat CT in 6 wks to assess for changes in pulm nodules
   # RUE DVT: Pt found to have occlusive thrombus in cephalic vein on RUE
   U/S.
   -- continue heparin gtt
   #Fever, leukocytosis
 suggest infectious process despite broad
   spectrum antibiotics for VAP.  Pt not immunocompromised so unlikely to
   have opportunistic infection.  Right sided flank pain has resolved.
   RUQ without any acute pathology, c.diff negative x 3. CT torso with no
   abdominal pathology, continued increase in lipase but no clinical sx of
   pancreatitis. Possible aspiration pneumonitis.  AMS but no meningeal
   signs.  Other noninfectious etiologies for FUO include autoimmune dx,
   drug fever, malignancy, DVT

   # Transminitis: infectious, drug effect (on amiodarone, zosyn), hepatic
   vein thrombosis, underlying cirrhosis, congestive from fluid overload.
   RUQ U/S with dopplers with no acute pathology. Trending down after d/c
   of Amio.
   -- d/c amiodarone
   # ANEMIA: initial drop in HCT from 41 to 30. Has been stable for
   several days. Currently 33.5.
   - hemolysis labs negative [**12-26**]
   - monitor HCT
   # WCT: Rate near 300bpm s/p cardioversion with extreme axis and
   concordance, making it most likely to be VT. No further episodes of VT.
   Has persistent PVCs. Dobutamine discontinued with decrease in ectopy.
   TSH 1.0 on [**2124-12-23**].  Continues to have PVCs but not NSVT.
   -- continue metoprolol at increased dose
   -- d/ced amiodarone given transaminitis
   -- Replete lytes
   -- Telemetry
   -- cath, consider ICD when stable
   -- f/u EP recs regarding over potential antiarrhythmics
   # CORONARIES:  Low suspicion ACS. Refused cath in past, unknown
   coronary anatomy. Initial enzymes negative.
   - ASA 325, BB, ACEi
   - cath when stable
   # PUMP:  EF 20%, clinically euvolemic to slightly dehydrated with
   metabolic alkalosis on labs.   Unclear if ischemic, alcoholic, vs
   idiopathic CMY.
   - Daily weights, strict I/Os, goal even
   - continue metoprolol, ACEI
   # Hx Alcohol use: had some episodes of hallucinations after d/c
   midazolam that resolved with valium per CIWA scale.  Current delirium
   more likely related to ICU psychosis than DTs
   - CIWA scale
   - Ativan prn agitation as antipsychotics relatively contraindicated:

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, and was hospitalized due to profound hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation. The patient's current conditions include hypoxia, right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), fever, leukocytosis, and delirium.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia (PNA). This can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage if not managed properly.

2. Right Upper Extremity DVT: The occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein of the right upper extremity indicates a risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) if the clot dislodges and travels to the lungs. Anticoagulation therapy is being continued to prevent further clot formation and potential embolization.

3. Fever and Leukocytosis: Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), the patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest an ongoing infectious process. Further evaluation is needed to identify the causative organism and adjust antibiotic therapy accordingly.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient has a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy and presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with VT. There was also an episode of VT today. The patient is currently on lidocaine and metoprolol, but further intervention may be required, such as an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities on CT torso, which are consistent with pulmonary edema. The patient also has evidence of aspiration pneumonia. Measures to improve oxygenation and remove secretions should be continued.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity. Heparin therapy should be continued, and the PTT should be monitored.

4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has persistent fevers despite broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Non-infectious causes of FUO should also be considered, such as autoimmune diseases, drug fever, malignancy, or DVT.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presents with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT). The patient's hospital course has been complicated by profound hypotension, respiratory distress requiring intubation, increasing white blood cell count, persistent fevers, and delirium.

The patient had an episode of VT today but maintained pulse and mentation throughout. He was started on lidocaine infusion. The plan includes continuing lidocaine, maintaining telemetry, discussing with electrophysiology regarding timing for cardiac catheterization and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, and replete electrolytes.

The patient also has multifactorial hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia (PNA). The chest x-ray showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates, relatively unchanged despite significant diuresis and clinical euvolemia. Multiple negative sputum cultures were obtained. Saturations are improving with suctioning, and oxygen requirement is decreasing. A CT torso revealed bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs, consistent with multifocal versus aspiration PNA; extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcifications - question of reactive versus malignancy. 

The patient has an occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity (RUE"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has a history of recent antibiotic use, including piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole, vancomycin, and meropenem. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium infusion. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.4°F, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/78 mmHg to 143/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's weight is currently 94.2 kg. The patient has received respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///23/. Physical examination findings include peripheral vascular assessment not assessed, skin not assessed, neurologic assessment not assessed, and other assessments as noted. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 19.2 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hgb) at 11.0 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function with creatinine (Cr) levels ranging from 1.4 to 1.7 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and abnormal cardiac markers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated WBC count suggest the possibility of an infection."

   Disposition:
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Fever: The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, which could indicate an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

2. Delirium/Confusion: The patient is experiencing episodes of delirium and confusion, which may be secondary to ICU psychosis, systemic illness, or fever. It is important to monitor the patient's mental status and provide appropriate interventions such as sedation with haloperidol or olanzapine.

3. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient had a wide complex tachycardia consistent with VT, which was treated with cardioversion. The patient remains at risk for recurrent VT or other arrhythmias, especially given the history of cardiomyopathy. Close monitoring with telemetry is necessary, and the patient may require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) when stable.

4. Pulmonary Edema/ARDS: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as indicated by diffuse bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and CT scan. This requires aggressive management with diuretics, oxygen therapy, and possibly mechanical ventilation. The underlying cause of ARDS needs further evaluation, including ruling out aspiration pneumonia and other infections.

5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has an occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity"

","The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presents with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He was hospitalized previously for profound hypotension and respiratory distress requiring intubation. Currently, he has increasing WBC count, persistent fevers, and delirium.

The patient experienced episodes of VT that responded to lidocaine and is currently on a lidocaine drip. He is also on metoprolol, and amiodarone has been discontinued due to transaminitis. The plan is to continue telemetry, discuss further recommendations with an electrophysiologist (EP), and consider catheter ablation and ICD placement.

The patient also has multifactorial hypoxia, including pulmonary edema, ARDS, and PNA. His respiratory status has improved, and he is only requiring 4L NC. Negative sputum cultures and frequent suctioning are recommended. A repeat CT in 6 weeks is advised for changes in pulmonary nodules and cardiac MR.

Additionally, the patient has an occlusive thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity (RUE), along with hematuria. Heparin gtt with a conservative PTT goal of 60-80 is recommended.

The patient's fever and leukocytosis are trending down, suggesting an improving infectious process. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with ventricular tachycardia and profound hypotension, leading to intubation. The patient has had episodes of fever, leukocytosis, and delirium. His respiratory status has improved, and he has been weaned off supplemental oxygen. Multiple negative sputum cultures indicate a lack of bacterial infection. A CT scan revealed bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs, suggesting multifocal pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcifications may be reactive or indicative of malignancy.

The patient also has a superficial thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity. His fever and leukocytosis suggest an infectious process despite prior broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia. There is no evidence of immunocompromise or opportunistic infection. The patient's lipase levels are elevated, but he does not exhibit clinical symptoms of pancreatitis. This could be due to aspiration pneumonitis.

The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) are stable, and lipase levels are trending down. There is a possibility of drug-induced pancreatitis or hepatic vein thrombosis. A non-contrast CT scan showed no pancreatic abnormalities.

The patient has anemia, with a drop in hematoc"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, which was consistent with ventricular tachycardia. The patient underwent cardioversion and started on amiodarone. He also has an episode of VT two days prior that responded to lidocaine. His leukocytosis and fever curve have improved, and he is now stable on amiodarone 400mg PO BID.

The patient had respiratory distress requiring intubation and is now weaned to room air. He has multifocal vs aspiration pneumonia with extensive mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy with calcifications. The cause of the lymphadenopathy is uncertain, possibly reactive versus malignancy. He completed vancomycin and meropenem as per ID recommendation.

The patient has a superficial thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity. No indication for continued anticoagulation is needed.

The patient is febrile and leukocytosis is stable at 15.3. He is improving on [**Last Name (un) 350**]. There is a suggestion of an infectious process despite prior broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The patient is not immunocompromised, making it unlikely to have an opportunistic infection. The RUQ is without any acute pathology, and c. difficile is negative x3. CT torso shows no abdominal pathology,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, which was consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and responded to cardioversion. The patient has had multiple medical complications since admission, including profound hypotension, respiratory distress, delirium, fever, leukocytosis, and hypoxia. The patient has been treated with various medications such as amiodarone, metoprolol, lisinopril, and lasix. He also received broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular Tachycardia (VT): The patient initially presented with wide complex tachycardia consistent with VT. He responded to cardioversion and was started on amiodarone, but further episodes have been absent. The patient is advised to continue amiodarone and monitor liver function tests (LFTs).

2. Pulmonary Edema/ARDS/Pneumonia: The patient had hypoxia due to pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia. He was intubated and weaned off supplemental oxygen. Negative sputum cultures were obtained, and a CT scan revealed bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs, suggesting multifocal versus aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being treated with nebulizers, frequent suction"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy. He presented with wide complex tachycardia, consistent with ventricular tachycardia, and was cardioverted. He also had an episode of VT two days prior that responded to lidocaine. The patient is currently on amiodarone and metoprolol. Telemetry is ongoing, and the patient will need a cardiac catheterization and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement.

The patient was previously intubated due to respiratory distress but has now been weaned to room air. He has had multiple negative sputum cultures. A CT scan of the torso showed bibasilar consolidations with nodular opacities within the lungs, consistent with multifocal or aspiration pneumonia. The patient is being suctioned frequently to remove secretions, and nebulizers are being used as needed. A follow-up CT in six weeks is planned to assess changes in the pulmonary nodules and cardiac MR.

The patient also has a superficial thrombus in the cephalic vein on the right upper extremity. No further anticoagulation is indicated.

The patient has been febrile and leukocytosis is stable at 15.3. Despite prior broad-spectrum antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia, the patient is still febrile. The source of infection is still being investigated, with blood, sputum, and urine cultures"

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever. The patient has been in the ICU for an unknown duration and has multiple medical complications including fever, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the upper extremity, delirium/confusion, pain control, alcohol withdrawal, cardiomyopathy, impaired skin integrity, alteration in nutrition, respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, anxiety, ventricular tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient's persistent high body temperature indicates an ongoing infection or inflammation.
2. DVT in the upper extremity: The presence of a blood clot in the arm can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism or tissue damage if not promptly treated.
3. Delirium/confusion: The patient's altered mental state may be due to various factors like infections, medications, or withdrawal symptoms.
4. Pain control: The patient is experiencing acute and chronic pain, which needs to be managed effectively to prevent further complications.
5. Alcohol withdrawal: If the patient has a history of alcohol abuse, withdrawal symptoms can occur, potentially leading to severe complications like seizures.
6. Cardiomyopathy: The patient's heart muscle may be weakened, compromising cardiac function and increasing the risk of heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Impaired skin integrity: Poor skin condition can lead to pressure ulcers or infections, which can complicate the"
