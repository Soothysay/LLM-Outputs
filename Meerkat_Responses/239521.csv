   -was put on PS 10/5/60% however ABG: 7.2/52/100 so was switched back to
   AC
   -Pt initially very difficult to ventilate. Pt had a prolonged forced
   exhalation that did not improve with fent/versed. Developed
   bronchospasm and produced large amts of thick frothy bloody sput. Peep
   increased to 10 due to probable airtrapping. Pt overbreathing
   consistently so volume / rate increased. Sedation changed to prop with
   better ventilatory pattern established.
   -placed a line and CVL
   -found OG tube to be curled in mouth so attempt was made to replace
   with NG however patient brady to 40s and withdrawn
   -. At this point patient given Lasix and put out approximately 1L, and
   then became hypotensive to SBPs 80s so was given 1L NS bolus around
   4am.
   -Hct check done and 32.9
   -sister was to come but never did
   -needs ICU consent
   - heparin gtt decreaseed
   -Pt seen by ENT this am-large hematoma noted.  Passed NG tube.

   Imaging: [**12-19**] CT CHEST: There are filling defects within the right
   subsegmental arteries (3, 14 and 3, 26) supplying the anterior and
   posterior segments. In addition, filling defects involving the right
   middle lobe subsegmental branches (3, 47) are also identified. There
   are possible left upper lobe subgmental pulmonary emboli (3,24). There
   are bilateral lower lobe consolidations with air
   bronchograms (3, 57). While this may represent atelectasis as it is
   enhancing, underlying infection cannot be excluded given the presence
   of air
   bronchograms. There are multiple mediastinal and left hilar lymph
   nodes. For example, at example, there is a left hilar lymph node
   measuring 1.3 x 1.5 cm (3, 43). A prevascular lymph node measures 0.7 x
   2.3 cm (3, 27). There is no axillary lymphadenopathy identified. There
   is no pleural effusion. Very trace pericardial fluid vs thickening is
   noted. There is no evidence of aortic dissection. No pneumothorax is
   seen. Gynecomastia is noted.
   CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The spleen, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal
   glands and kidneys are unremarkable. There is mild amount of
   perinephric fat
   stranding, bilaterally, nonspecific. Multiple small, subcentimeter
   retroperitoneal lymph nodes are noted. Small bowel loops are collapsed.
   There
   is no free fluid or free air.
   CT OF THE PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon are unremarkable and
   contains large amount of stool and air. A Foley catheter is identified
   within the
   bladder. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.
   BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions
   identified.
   IMPRESSION:
   1. Small right-sided subsegmental pulmonary emboli as described above.
   Possible left upper lobe subgmental pulmonary emboli. No evidence of
   right
   heart strain.
   2. Bilateral lower lobe atelectasis; underlying infection not excluded.
   3. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
   4. No acute intra-abdominal pathology noted.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder, was transferred from Hospital3 with respiratory distress and intubation. He is currently in the ICU and on invasive ventilation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's low blood pressures in the emergency department compared to baseline suggest sepsis physiology. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 68/47 mmHg to 130/104 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's blood glucose level is 102 mg/dL, white blood cell count is 5.2 K/uL, hematocrit is 32.9%, and platelet count is 108 K/uL. Imaging results show small right-sided subsegmental pulmonary emboli, possible left upper lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The patient has been treated with Tamiflu for influenza, Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone for community-acquired pneumonia, and Lasix for fluid overload."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and intubation. The patient has been experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, and the differential diagnosis includes pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The CT scan of the chest revealed small right-sided subsegmental pulmonary emboli, possible left upper lobe subsegmental pulmonary emboli, bilateral lower lobe atelectasis with underlying infection not excluded, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. There were no signs of right heart strain, acute intra-abdominal pathology, or pneumothorax.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with low blood pressures and a heart rate in the 40s during the attempted insertion of a nasogastric (NG) tube. The patient also has thrombocytopenia and elevated CK levels. The patient's condition is likely due to a combination of factors including infectious process, possible PE, and other underlying medical conditions.

The patient's allergies include aspirin, and he is currently on multiple medications including propofol, norepinephrine, furosemide (Lasix), levofloxacin, and others. The patient's family history is significant for Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital with respiratory distress and was intubated upon arrival. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with episodes of hypotension and bradycardia. He has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis. There is evidence of right subsegmental pulmonary emboli and possible left upper lobe subsegmental PE. The patient's blood work shows elevated troponin levels, indicating possible cardiac involvement. Imaging studies reveal mediastinal lymphadenopathy, bilateral lower lobe consolidations, and a large abrasion on the oral mucosa. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, sedation, and various medications, including anticoagulants, antibiotics, and antivirals. His condition remains critical, and he requires close monitoring and ongoing treatment in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggests a possible infectious process, which could lead to sepsis.
2. Pulmonary hypertension: The presence of multiple pulmonary emboli may result in increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to pulmonary hypertension.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and bilateral lower lobe atelectasis increase the risk of respiratory failure.

   Disposition: ICU level of care
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder who was transferred from another hospital with respiratory distress and intubation. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension, respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism. The patient's fever is likely due to an infectious process or a pulmonary embolism. His unresponsiveness is secondary to sedation. The patient has iron-deficient anemia, elevated CK levels, thrombocytopenia, and a history of depression and seizures. The patient is being treated with antivirals for influenza and antibiotics for a suspected bacterial infection. Heparin is being administered for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis, and the patient is also on medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis and ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention. The patient's condition is stable, but there are potential medical complications that can arise, such as worsening pneumonia, sepsis, further complications from pulmonary embolism, and potential malignancy related to Crohn's disease."

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and intubation. He has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly due to influenza with a superimposed bacterial infection, as well as pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving treatment for influenza with Tamiflu and for CAP with Levofloxacin/Ceftriaxone. He is also on heparin gtt for DVT prophylaxis and Coumadin for PE treatment. The patient has shown improvement in his condition but still requires close monitoring.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if there is a progression of the underlying infection or if the mechanical ventilation settings need to be adjusted.
2. Pulmonary Embolism: The patient is already being treated for PE, but there is a risk of further embolic events or worsening of the condition if not adequately managed.
3. Sepsis: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infectious process. Sepsis can develop if the infection spreads and becomes systemic.
4. Bleeding: The patient is on anticoagulant therapy with heparin and Coumadin, which increases the risk of bleeding complications.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has been declining,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder, who was transferred from another hospital due to respiratory distress and intubation. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's main issues include hypotension (not in shock), respiratory failure (acute), and pulmonary embolism (PE). He also has a fever, likely due to an infectious process, and unresponsiveness, which is believed to be secondary to sedation. The patient has anemia, elevated CK levels, thrombocytopenia, and a history of depression and seizures. He is being treated for influenza, CAP, and PE. The patient has undergone several diagnostic tests and procedures, including an ultrasound, trans-thoracic echo, blood cultures, urine culture, and imaging studies. The patient's condition requires ongoing monitoring and management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever, hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a possible infection, which could lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and need for intubation indicate acute respiratory failure. There is a concern for possible ARDS or pneumonia.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has evidence of PE on imaging studies. If not appropriately managed, it can lead to further complications such as right ventricular strain"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory distress and intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with hypotension, respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism. He is currently being treated for influenza with Tamiflu, and antibiotics have been changed to Levofloxacin due to negative sputum cultures. Heparin has been started for anticoagulation, and Coumadin will be initiated once the patient is stable. The patient also has anemia, elevated CK levels, and a possible malignancy. He has a history of depression and seizures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient may develop sepsis due to a possible bacterial infection, especially since he is immunocompromised.
2. Pneumonia: There is a risk of pneumonia due to his respiratory failure and the presence of an endotracheal tube.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobility and anticoagulation therapy.
4. Bleeding: The patient may experience bleeding complications due to anticoagulation therapy.
5. Malignancy: The patient's anemia could be related to possible malignancy, which may require further evaluation and management.
6. Seizure activity: The patient's history of seizures increases the"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and intubated. The patient's current conditions include hypotension, respiratory failure, and pulmonary embolism (PE). 

The patient has been treated for influenza with Tamiflu 150 mg, and the treatment can be continued for up to 6 weeks. Levofloxacin and ceftriaxone are being used for CAP (community-acquired pneumonia). Heparin is being administered via gtt (intravenous drip) for anticoagulation, and Coumadin will be started once the patient's bleeding is stable over the next 2 days. 

The patient has anemia, which may be related to possible malignancy. Iron supplements will be started as an outpatient. Elevated CK levels are likely due to inactivity. Thrombocytopenia is also present, with a platelet count of 109. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further respiratory failure if there is a superimposed bacterial infection on top of influenza. The PE (pulmonary embolism) could lead to complications such as right heart strain or even saddle pulmonary embolism if it migrates to both pulmonary arteries. The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis physiology or diastolic CHF ( congestive heart failure). 

Overall, the patient requires careful monitoring and management of their respiratory status, bleeding risk, and potential complications related to PE, pneumonia, and possible malignancy."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital due to respiratory distress and intubation.
2. The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection. This could also be caused by known pulmonary embolisms (PEs). An echocardiogram suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF).
3. The patient occasionally experiences low blood pressures, which could indicate sepsis physiology.
4. Bronchoscopy is planned today to evaluate for lymph nodes and malignancy, but a pediatric scope will be used due to the small endotracheal tube.
5. Treatment for influenza includes Tamiflu 150 mg, which can be used for up to six weeks.
6. Nebulizers will be administered as part of the treatment.
7. As all sputum cultures have been negative so far, the antibiotic treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) will be changed to Levofloxacin only. Ceftriaxone has been stopped.
8. For pulmonary embolism (PE), continuous heparin gtt will be continued, and Coumadin can likely be started today.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital after experiencing respiratory distress and intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications.

The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. He has been diagnosed with hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection. There are also indications of pulmonary edema and bibasal consolidations on the chest X-ray. The endotracheal tube tip is impinging the left tracheal wall, and the patient's right internal jugular line is at the level of the cavoatrial junction.

The patient has a fever, which could be due to an infectious process or possibly related to pulmonary embolism. Anemia has been identified, which is likely iron-deficient. The patient's elevated CK levels are currently downtrending and may be related to inactivity or viral illness.

The patient has a history of depression and seizures, for which his home medications have been restarted. There are also concerns about possible malignancy.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.8°C (100.1°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/62 mmHg to 168/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The"

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from Hospital3 with respiratory distress and intubation. The patient has respiratory failure due to influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection and known PEs. An echo suggests mild diastolic CHF. The patient occasionally has low blood pressures, suggesting sepsis physiology.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/61 mmHg to 153/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the ventilator. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 20 mmHg.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,311 mL and output of 2,330 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 19 mL. The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids, including Heparin sodium, propofol, midazolam, and fentanyl.

Laboratory results show white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin at 10.1 g/dL, platelet count at 214 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 105 mg/dL, creatinine at 1.9 mg/dL, and liver enzymes within normal range."

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital with respiratory distress and intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute hypoxic due to influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection, as well as known pulmonary embolisms (PEs). An echo suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient continues to have low lung volumes and significant atelectasis on chest X-ray (CXR).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure and low lung volumes indicate a risk for further respiratory complications, such as pneumonia or worsening ARDS.
2. Cardiac Complications: The presence of mild diastolic CHF suggests potential cardiac complications, including worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infectious Complications: The patient's history of influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection increases the risk of developing additional infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or bloodstream infections.
4. Thromboembolic Complications: Given the known PEs, there is a continued risk for thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient's altered mental status and history of seizures may increase the risk of neurological complications, including focal neurologic deficits or status epileptic"

   transferred from [**Hospital3 **] s/p respiratory distress and
   intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]), hypoxic: Likely due to
   influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection.  Also due to
   known PEs.  Echo suggests mild diastolic CHF.  Patient with
   occassionally low BPs in ED so sepsis-physiology is possible.
   - bronch unable to be performed because could not obtain pediatric
   scope (because ETT small), plan was to look for malignancy
   - Per ID, tamiflu should continue for at least 7 days, then reassess;
   on Tamiflu 150 mg [**Hospital1 7**], can be used for up 6 weeks
   - standing nebs

   failed; patient now back on propofol
   .
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   - started coumadin yesterday, will continue to titrate up

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU after experiencing respiratory distress and intubation. The patient's main diagnoses include acute respiratory failure due to influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection, acute pulmonary embolism, and mild diastolic congestive heart failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing and requires mechanical ventilation. This could be due to influenza infection with possible bacterial superinfection.
2. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has evidence of PE, likely causing his respiratory distress. Heparin and Coumadin are being used for anticoagulation therapy.
3. Mild Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: An echocardiogram suggests mild diastolic CHF, which may contribute to the patient's symptoms.
4. Fever: The patient has low-grade temperatures at night, which could be related to an infectious process or a PE.
5. Anemia: The patient is iron-deficient and has a history of possible malignancy. Further investigation is needed.
6. Elevated CKs: The patient's creatine kinase levels are significantly elevated, possibly due to inactivity, viral illness, or seizures.
7. Depression/Seizure History: The patient's seizure disorder and depression history should be monitored closely.
8. Other issues: The"

 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   62 yo male with history of Crohn
s, hypertension, seizure d/o,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 **] s/p respiratory distress and
   intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]), hypoxic: Likely due to
   influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection.  Also due to
   known PEs.  Echo suggests mild diastolic CHF.  Unclear from records
   exactly why patient was intubated, but continues to have low lung
   volumes and significant atelectasis on CXR.
   - s/p bronch, no evidence of mass/malignancy
   - Per ID, tamiflu should continue for at least 7 days, then reassess;
   on Tamiflu 150 mg [**Hospital1 7**], can be used for up 6 weeks
   - standing nebs
   - As all sputum ctxs negative so far, completed treatment  for CAP with
   5 days Levofloxacin [**Date range (1) 12207**]
   - for PE, cont Heparin gtt and titrate up Coumadin to goal INR [**2-9**],
   coumadin 5 daily started on 12.17, increase to 7.5 today
   -goal net negative 1 liter today (LOS still +2.5L)
   -attempt to extubate today
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient agitated when sedation weaned.  Per
   patient
s brother he is functional at baseline.
   - f/u RPR
   -restarted home depakote dose
   - low threshold for head CT
   - low threshold for EEG if mental status remains altered with no clear
   cause
   .
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   - started coumadin yesterday, will continue to titrate up
   .
   #  Fever: Likely due to infectious process, however can be caused by a
   PE.  Low-grade temperatures at night mainly.
   - f/u culture data, including any which may have been obtained at
   [**Hospital3 **]
   - will contact [**Hospital3 611**] today to check on prior cultures
   # Anemia: Iron-deficient on studies.  B12 repleted
   - guaiac all stools
   - could be related to possible malignancy
   - continue iron therapy
   # Elevated CKs to 900s-1000s: Possibly due to inactivity or viral
   illness, less likely seizures.  Now downtrending
   -can stop checking daily since now in 100s
   #.  Depression/Seizure history: Restarted home meds, will monitor for
   increasing CK
   - continue home meds
   -ask pharmacy when to next check dilantin level

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, acute pulmonary embolism (PE), hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to influenza with a possible superimposed bacterial infection, as well as known PEs. An echo suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient underwent a bronchoscopy, which showed no evidence of malignancy or infection. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated CK levels, and low sodium levels. His vital signs show a fever, hypotension, and tachypnea. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, receiving 600 mL of tidal volume, with a PEEP of 5 cmH2O and FiO2 of 50%. 

The patient's medication includes heparin, propofol, fentanyl, and various other medications for his medical conditions. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may continue if there is a progression of his underlying conditions, such as influenza or bacterial infection.
2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has acute PE, which may lead to further complications such as right ventricular strain, hypoxemia, or even sudden cardiac arrest.
3. Hypotension: The patient"

 .H/O SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
   62 yo male with history of Crohn
s, hypertension, seizure d/o,
   transferred from [**Hospital3 **] s/p respiratory distress and
   intubation.
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**]), hypoxic: Likely due to
   influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection.  Also due to
   known PEs.  Echo suggests mild diastolic CHF.  Unclear from records
   exactly why patient was intubated, but continues to have low lung
   volumes and significant atelectasis on CXR.
   - bronch unable to be performed yesterday because could not obtain
   pediatric scope (because ETT small), plan was to look for malignancy
   - Will again attempt to bronch today if adaptor for pediatric scope
   available
   - Per ID, tamiflu should continue for at least 7 days, then reassess;
   on Tamiflu 150 mg [**Hospital1 7**], can be used for up 6 weeks
   - standing nebs
   - As all sputum ctxs negative so far, completed treatment  for CAP with
   5 days Levofloxacin [**Date range (1) 12207**]
   - for PE, cont Heparin gtt and titrate up Coumadin to goal INR [**2-9**]
   - Patient sedated on propofol (attempts to change to fentanyl/midaz
   unsuccessful); will check TG every 2-3 days
   - will attempt to diurese patient for goal 2-3L neg today
   - low threshold for repeat chest CT if bronch unrevealing
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient agitated when sedation weaned.  Per
   patient
s brother he is functional at baseline.
   - send RPR, TSH today (B12 checked and repleted)
   - will talk with pharmacy regarding seizure and psych meds to see if
   interacting
   - check dilantin level
   - wean sedation and assess patient for focal neurologic deficits
   - low threshold for head CT
   - low threshold for EEG if mental status remains altered with no clear
   cause
   .
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   - started coumadin yesterday, will continue to titrate up
   .
   #  Fever: Likely due to infectious process, however can be caused by a
   PE.  Low-grade temperatures at night mainly.
   - f/u culture data, including any which may have been obtained at
   [**Hospital3 **]
   - will contact [**Hospital3 611**] today to check on prior cultures
   # Anemia: Iron-deficient on studies.  B12 repleted
   - guaiac all stools
   - could be related to possible malignancy
   - continue iron therapy
   # Elevated CKs to 900s-1000s: Possibly due to inactivity or viral
   illness, less likely seizures.  Now downtrending
   -continue to monitor daily, trending down.
   #.  Depression/Seizure history: Restarted home meds, will monitor for
   increasing CK
   - continue home meds
   - speak with pharmacy as above and check dilantin level
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: Tube feeds, replete with fiber.  On hold, will restart after
   bronch.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital after experiencing respiratory distress and intubation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient is likely experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure due to influenza with a possible superimposed bacterial infection. This could also be caused by known pulmonary embolisms (PE). An echo suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient continues to have low lung volumes and significant atelectasis on the chest X-ray. A bronchoscopic evaluation will be attempted today.

2. Altered mental status (not delirium): The patient is agitated when sedation is weaned. The patient's brother reports that he is functional at baseline. Further investigations such as RPR, TSH, and B12 levels will be checked. There is a low threshold for repeat head CT and EEG if mental status remains altered with no clear cause.

3. Pulmonary embolism (PE), acute: The patient has been started on Coumadin, which will be continued and titrated up. 

4. Hypotension (not shock): The patient's blood pressure is low, but it is not classified as shock.

5. Fever: The patient has a low-grade temperature mainly at night. This could be due to an infectious process or a PE."

The patient's current conditions include acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), altered mental status (not delirium), pulmonary embolism (PE), and hypotension (not shock).

The patient has been experiencing low-grade temperatures at night, which could be due to an infectious process or PE. He also has inspiratory crackles in the right lung more than the left, indicating possible pneumonia. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 100/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, likely caused by influenza with a possible superimposed bacterial infection. This may be a result of known PEs. An echocardiogram suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's chest X-ray shows low lung volumes and significant atelectasis.

The patient has completed treatment for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with Levofloxacin for 5 days. He is currently receiving Heparin via gtt and Coumadin to treat PE, with the goal INR being 2-9. The patient's Coumadin dosage has been increased to 7"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital for respiratory distress and intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU due to several medical complications.

1. Seizure: The patient had a seizure without status epilepticus. There is no evidence of delirium or altered mental status.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, which is not ARDS. It is likely caused by influenza with possible superimposed bacterial infection. The patient also has known pulmonary embolisms (PE), and an echo suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient continues to have low lung volumes and significant atelectasis on the chest X-ray. A bronchoscopy was performed, showing no evidence of malignancy or infection.

3. Altered mental status: The patient is agitated when sedation is weaned. The patient's brother states that he is functional at baseline. A low threshold for head CT and EEG should be considered if the mental status remains altered with no clear cause.

4. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has an acute PE. Coumadin therapy has been started, and the goal INR is 2-9. The patient will continue to be monitored for any complications related to PE.

5. Fever: The patient has low-grade temperatures mainly during the"

   Assessment and Plan
 Respiratory failure,
   - continues on minimal vent support, no clear airway plugging on
   bronch, bilateral lower lobe collapse likely [**2-8**] effusions
   - now autodiuresing but still little effect seen on CXR
   - will awaken and SBT this afternoon, but will likely keep intubated
   until tomorrow when more diuresed
   - goal TBB - 2 to 3 L
 Influenza
   - tamiflu to end tomorrow, can come off precautions tomorrow
   -
 PULMONARY EMBOLISM (PE), ACUTE
   - bridging with heparin to coumadin, increase coumadin to 7.5mg today
 Fever
 Agitation: may be driven by dyspnea v. [**Last Name **] problem
   - will re-assess today when sedatio weaned
   - consider EEG and head CT if significantly altered
 Constipation
   - continue bowel regimen, will change to standing today

","The patient is currently in the ICU due to respiratory failure. They are on minimal ventilator support and have bilateral lower lobe collapse with likely pleural effusions. The patient is autodiuresing but has not seen a significant effect on the chest X-ray. They will be awakened and a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) will be conducted this afternoon, but it is likely that they will remain intubated until tomorrow when they are more diuresed. The goal for their tidal volume (TBB) is 2 to 3 liters.

The patient is being treated for influenza with Tamiflu, which will be stopped tomorrow, and they can come off precautions tomorrow as well.

There is a concern for pulmonary embolism (PE), acute, so the patient is being bridged with heparin to coumadin, and the dose of coumadin will be increased to 7.5 mg today.

The patient has a fever and agitation, which may be driven by dyspnea or another underlying issue. This will be re-assessed today when sedation is weaned, and consideration will be given to an EEG and head CT if the patient's mental status is significantly altered.

The patient also has constipation and their bowel regimen will be continued, with a change to standing today.

Valproate has been increased for seizures, and the patient's medication level will be re-checked.

In terms of ICU care, the patient's nutrition is being managed, with the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital after experiencing respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to influenza with a possible superimposed bacterial infection. He also has acute pulmonary embolism (PE) and mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.6°F), heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 124/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. He is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin (Hct), prolonged prothrombin time (PT), and elevated troponin-T levels. 

The patient has been treated with antibiotics, antiviral medication (Tamiflu), and anticoagulants (heparin and Coumadin). His current plan involves weaning off sedation, attempting extubation, and continuing with ongoing management for his medical conditions.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of Crohn's disease, hypertension, and seizure disorder. He was transferred from another hospital due to respiratory distress and intubation. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical conditions.

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, likely due to influenza with a possible superimposed bacterial infection. This is also related to known pulmonary embolisms (PE). An echocardiogram suggests mild diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF). It is unclear from the records why the patient was initially intubated, but he continues to have high minute ventilation and significant atelectasis on chest X-ray.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of multiple PEs. He is being treated with heparin and Coumadin to prevent further clotting. The goal is to titrate up Coumadin to achieve an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2-9.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to the seizure disorder or medication effects. He becomes agitated when sedation is weaned. The patient's brother reports that he is functional at baseline.

4. Hypotension: The patient has hypotension that is not believed to be in shock. It may be related to the PE or CHF.

   Assessment and Plan
 Respiratory Failure
   - main barrier to extubation now is volume overload, is autodiuresing
   - plan to allow autodiuresis +/- lasix assitance to goal body balance
   -3L
   - will awake and SBT in the am and extubate if does well and secretions
   not increased
   - continue propofol sedation for now
 Fever
   - new fever over past two days, unlikely to be influenza and may be
   VAP, no other clear source
   - on vancomycin/cefepime for VAP and awaiting sputum culture
   - monitor for other signs of etiology; no RUQ pain to suggest
   acalculous cholecystitis, is therapeutically anticoagulated so clot
   unlikely source, etc.
 Change in mental status/Sedation
   - has been agitated off sedation previously, much improved this morning
   - no plan now for Precedex given how calm he is this morning off
   propfol
 Pulmonary Embolism
   - therapeutically anticoagulated on heparin, bridging to coumadin
 H/o seizure disorder
   - on home AEDs

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder who was admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and hypotension, diagnosed with H1N1 influenza and shock. The patient's current condition shows ongoing volume overload, which is a potential medical complication. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/61 mmHg to 154/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on ventilator support.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 307 K/uL, elevated creatinine levels at 1.7 mg/dL, elevated lactate levels at 30.3%, and abnormal coagulation profile with PT/INR values of 16.2/1.4. Other lab values such as hemoglobin, platelet count, electrolytes, and liver enzymes are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's ABG results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 34 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and ongoing treatment. They were admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure, altered mental status, and pulmonary embolism. The patient has a history of seizures and is currently being treated for suspected viral-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime). There is also a concern for possible influenza infection. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and hypotension. They are on mechanical ventilation support and have shown improvement in their respiratory status. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, with periods of agitation and calmness. Sedation is being carefully managed. The patient is receiving appropriate care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is set to full code, indicating that all measures should be taken to save their life in case of cardiac or respiratory arrest. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. The current treatment plan includes elevating the head of bed, mouth care, and daily wake-up calls to prevent this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is already diagnosed with PE, and there"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with several medical complications. They have a history of seizure disorder and respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient also has altered mental status, which is not delirium, and a recent pulmonary embolism (PE). Additionally, the patient is experiencing hypotension, fever, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's main barrier to extubation now is volume overload. They are autodiuresing, and the plan is to allow autodiuresis with or without lasix assistance to achieve a balanced body fluid level. The patient's respiratory status has improved, as indicated by the improving chest X-ray and reduced vent requirements. A spontaneous breathing test (SBT) of 60 has been achieved, and an attempt at extubation today will be made.

2. Fever: The patient continues to have a fever for three days, which is unlikely to be due to influenza. It may be caused by VAP, and the patient is on vancomycin and cefepime for this condition. Sputum cultures are pending, and other potential sources of infection should be monitored. The patient is therapeutically anticoagulated, making a clot an unlikely source of infection.

3. Change in Mental Status/Sedation: The patient has been agitated off sedation previously and showed improvement this morning. There"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of seizures, respiratory failure, altered mental status, pulmonary embolism, and hypotension. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 115/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support index (RSBI) of 60. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood cultures have been taken but are pending. The patient is receiving antibiotics for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and is being treated with anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism.

The plan for the patient includes allowing autodiuresis or assisting with lasix to achieve body balance and attempt extubation today. The patient will continue on Tamiflu and may be discharged from droplet precautions. Sedation management will be monitored, and consideration will be given to increasing the dose of Valproic Acid due to low levels. The patient is being therapeutically anticoagulated on heparin, bridging to coumadin. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk"

   may be VAP, no other clear source
   - on day 2 vancomycin/cefepime for VAP
tailor or d/c  pending cx data
   - monitor for other signs of etiology; no RUQ pain to suggest

   Assessment and Plan
   # Respiratory Failure
   - main barrier to extubation has been volume o/l
   --autodiuresing well over past few days
   - doing well now with minimal ventilatory support
   --as sedation wears off, will move toward extubation
    # Fever
   - low grade, no leukocytosis
   --unlikely to be influenza, ? VAP, no other obvious source-- no RUQ
   pain to suggest acalculous cholecystitis, therapeutically
   anticoagulated so clot unlikely source
   - now on day 2 vancomycin/cefepime for presumed VAP
tailor or d/c
   pending cx data
   - follow LFTs
   - monitor for other signs of etiology
   # Change in mental status
   - continues to improve as we lighten sedation
   # Pulmonary Embolism
   -therapeutically anticoagulated on heparin, bridging to coumadin
   -as hct has remained stable, will checnge to lovenox for bridge
   # Seizure disorder
   -on home AEDs, adjust dosing for therapeutic levels

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of seizure disorder who was transferred from an outside hospital with respiratory failure and hypotension. The patient has been diagnosed with H1N1. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.3°F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 124/57 mmHg to 154/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging shows slight improvement in aeration at the lung bases, bilateral effusions, and basilar consolidation/atelectasis.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure, with the main barrier to extubation being volume overload, which is improving over the past few days. The patient is now doing well with minimal ventilatory support. Fever is present but low-grade and likely due to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on day 2 of vancomycin/cefepime for presumed VAP. Change in mental status is improving as sedation is lightened. The patient is also being treated for pulmonary embolism with therapeutic anticoagulation. 

In terms of potential medical complications, the"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic liver disease, hypertension, and epilepsy. The patient presented to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure and other complications.

The patient has been extubated but still requires supplemental oxygen through a high flow neb. He is currently receiving multiple medications including antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), antivirals (Tamiflu) for influenza, anticoagulants (lovenox and coumadin) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and sedatives for sedation.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure of 130/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on aerosol-cool delivery. He is on CPAP/PSV mode ventilation with a tidal volume of 24 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating an ongoing inflammatory response. His blood glucose levels have been fluct"

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) due to H1N1 influenza. The patient has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 133/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on aerosol-cool. The patient has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and seizures, for which he is on home anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).

The patient has been receiving various treatments including Tamiflu, vancomycin, cefepime, enoxaparin (Lovenox), and other ICU medications. He has been diuresed and is expected to continue with autodiuresis. The patient's mental status has been improving, but there is a concern for delirium. He is being closely monitored for any changes in his condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is still experiencing significant hypoxia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has completed a course of antibiotics for VAP, but it needs to be closely monitored and treated accordingly.
3. Fever: The patient has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic conditions such as hypertension and epilepsy. He was admitted to the hospital due to hypoxic respiratory failure and intubation. The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially experienced respiratory failure and required intubation. However, after extubation on [**12-27**], his respiratory status improved and he appeared comfortable.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been confused and disoriented, with a baseline mild cognitive impairment (MS) that is worse than usual but improving slowly. This could be due to sedating drugs and should be monitored closely.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute PE. He is on lovenox to coumadin, and his coumadin dosage was increased to 10mg yesterday.

4. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of epilepsy and is currently on home antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), except for Valproic Acid, whose level is still low. He should be switched to his home PO dose.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of chronic illnesses, hypertension, and epilepsy. He presented with hypoxic respiratory failure and required intubation. The patient has multiple medical complications including altered mental status, acute pulmonary embolism, hypotension, and a recent seizure. He is currently being treated for influenza and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with antibiotics. The patient's condition is improving, but he still requires assistance with autodiuresis using lasix to achieve body balance. There are no signs of other etiologies such as acalculous cholecystitis. The patient's mental status is improving, but he is still sedated. A head CT may be considered if there are lateralized signs or if the patient does not improve over the next 1-2 days. The patient is receiving anticoagulation therapy with enoxaparin and warfarin for pulmonary embolism. His Valproic Acid level is still low, so he will be changed to a home PO dose. The patient is critically ill and currently in the ICU."

","The patient is a 74-year-old male who presented with respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), H1N1 infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient's condition remains unstable, and there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

1. Hypoxia: The patient has a history of resolving ARDS, VAP, and volume overload. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen levels closely and provide appropriate respiratory support.

2. Mental status: The patient continues to improve slowly but remains off from baseline. There is suspicion of infection or medication-related causes for the altered mental status. Regular neurological assessments and monitoring for any signs of infection should be done.

3. Weakness: The patient is very weak, and it is probable that the ICU myopathy is the cause. Physical therapy should continue to aid in the patient's recovery.

4. Pulmonary embolism: The patient is on Lovenox for bridging anticoagulation, along with therapeutic INR. Hct remains stable, and it is important to continue monitoring the patient's clotting parameters and considering further anticoagulation management as needed.

5. Seizure disorder: The patient is advised to take home AEDs (anti-epileptic drugs). It is crucial to monitor for any seizure activity and ensure compliance with medication regimen.

Overall, the patient requires close monitoring and management of various medical complications, including hypox"
