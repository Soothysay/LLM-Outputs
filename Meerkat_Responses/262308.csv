   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes and likely culprit lesion in the left circumflex artery, as determined by angiographic findings. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents to the left circumflex artery and received a loading dose of Plavix. The plan includes increasing the statin dose, monitoring cardiac enzymes, and performing a post-catheterization check.

The patient is also diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure, likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferiorolateral wall motion abnormalities. There is a possibility of papillary muscle ischemia. An IABP was inserted to reduce afterload and improve coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents. Anticoagulation with bivalirudin was initiated and switched to heparin after 2 hours.

Other assessments and plans include aortic stenosis with a gradient of 20 mmHg, atrial fibrillation (currently in sinus rhythm), respiratory failure secondary to CH"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK levels, indicating ongoing ischemia. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely due to ischemic heart failure, which necessitated mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic heart failure/acute MR: The patient's significant MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities suggest possible papillary muscle ischemia. IABP has been inserted to improve MR and coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents.
2. Thrombocytopenia: Although the likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is low based on the timing and stability of platelet count, monitoring is recommended.
3. Aortic stenosis: An echocardiogram revealed a mean gradient of 20, suggesting significant aortic stenosis.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but anticoagulation should be continued due to the presence of multiple comorbidities.
5. Respiratory failure/CHF: The patient requires mechanical ventilation with volume control.

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02
   who developed post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely
   culprit of LCx given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic
   findings. He has significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in
   nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP, and vasopressor support.
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
    - s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents to LCx
    - On Bivalrudin peri-procedure now on heparin gtt
    - Continue plavix
    - Continue statin
    - Trend CKs
 peak 2964 MB 220
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR
    - Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall
   motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle ischemia.
    - IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR, and
   also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new
      stents.
    - s/p Anticoagluation with Bivalrudin through 2h after plavix load,
   now on heparin gtt
    - To obtain pre-op echo if available to outpatient cardiologist/PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean dopamine as tolerated.
    - received IV furosemide yest
 will allow to autodiurese today
    - Wean peep to decrease afterload.
   # Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and current
   stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis
   - continue to follow
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   #. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
    - Presently in sinus
    - Discontinue amio for now
    - Anticoagulation at present with heparin going forward for now
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
    - Mechanical ventilation with volume control for now
   #. s/p Total Hip
    - Consider orthopaedics to follow while in house
    - Have emailed his orthopod.
   #. Anemia
    - Will check full CBC on CCU admission now
    - Consider full anemia work-up

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. The patient developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK levels and likely culprit lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx), as indicated by precordial and lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher (drug-eluting stents) in the LCx artery. He was on bivalirudin peri-procedure and is now on heparin drip. The plan includes continuing Plavix and statin therapy, monitoring CK levels, and obtaining pre-operative echo if available for the cardiologist/PCP.

The patient's acute systolic heart failure and acute MR are likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. The IABP was inserted to reduce afterload and improve coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents. Anticoagulation with bivalirudin through 2 hours after Plavix load, followed by heparin drip, is planned. The patient will be weaned off"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02
   who developed post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely
   culprit of LCx given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic
   findings. He has significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in
   nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP, and vasopressor support.
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:
    - s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents to LCx
    - On Bivalrudin peri-procedure now on heparin gtt
    - Continue plavix
    - Continue statin
    - Trend CKs
 peak 2964 MB 220
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR
    - Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall
   motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle ischemia.
    - IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR, and
   also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new
      stents.
    - s/p Anticoagluation with Bivalrudin through 2h after plavix load,
   now on heparin gtt
    - To obtain pre-op echo if available to outpatient cardiologist/PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Wean dopamine as tolerated.
    - received IV furosemide yest
 will allow to autodiurese today
    - Wean peep to decrease afterload.
   # Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and current
   stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis
   - continue to follow
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   #. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
    - Presently in sinus
    - Discontinue amio for now
    - Anticoagulation at present with heparin going forward for now
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
    - Mechanical ventilation with volume control for now
   #. s/p Total Hip
    - Consider orthopaedics to follow while in house
    - Have emailed his orthopod.
   #. Anemia
    - Will check full CBC on CCU admission now
    - Consider full anemia work-up

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes and underwent revascularization with Cypher stents to the left circumflex artery. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely ischemic in nature, leading to acute heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP), and vasopressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Acute MR: The patient's MR is likely causing acute systolic heart failure. The IABP can help reduce afterload and improve MR, but there is a risk of worsening heart failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Close monitoring of platelet count and evaluation for thrombosis are necessary.
3. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has significant aortic stenosis, which can worsen over time and lead to further cardiac complications.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm, but there is a risk of developing atrial fibrillation, which can increase the risk of thromboembolic events.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak creatine kinase (CK) level of 1516, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The infarction was likely caused by a blocked left circumflex artery (LCx), as evidenced by precordial and lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to severe heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

Assessment and Plan:
1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   - The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents to the LCx artery.
   - Bivalirudin was used as an anticoagulant during the procedure.
   - The patient will receive a 600 mg oral Plavix load now, followed by ongoing administration of 75 mg daily.
   - Statin dose will be increased to 80 mg daily.
   - Trend CK levels.
   - Post-catheterization check and care per routine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU after undergoing a total right hip replacement surgery. He is currently experiencing complications related to myocardial infarction, specifically acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is being treated in the ICU.

24-hour events include changing phenylephrine to dopamine and noting heme-positive dark bilious fluid output from the nasogastric tube (NGT). The patient's vital signs show stable temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate within normal ranges. Oxygen saturation is at 96% on supplemental oxygen via an endotracheal tube. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals a central venous pressure (CVP) of 13 mmHg and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) of 64/29 mmHg. Cardiac output (CO) is 9.3 L/min with a cardiac index (CI) of 4.2 L/min/m2, indicating adequate cardiac function. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) is 66%, suggesting adequate tissue perfusion.

Fluid balance shows an input of 1,047 mL and output of 855 mL, with a net fluid balance of 192 mL. Respiratory support includes mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) of 550 mL, respiratory rate (RR) set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O,"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He subsequently developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK levels, likely due to occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx). This was confirmed through angiographic findings.

The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is most likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure. He requires mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents to the LCx artery. He is currently on bivalirudin peri-procedure and now on heparin gtt. He will continue taking Plavix and a statin.

The patient's acute systolic heart failure and acute MR are likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. There is a possibility of papillary muscle ischemia. The IABP has been inserted to reduce afterload and improve MR, as well as to increase coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents.

The patient is anticoagulated with bivalirudin through 2 hours after Plavix loading, now on heparin gtt. It is planned to obtain a pre-operative echo if available to be"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. Post-operatively, he developed a myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes, indicating a likely culprit of the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic heart failure/acute MR: This is likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. Possible papillary muscle ischemia. IABP was inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR, and also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
2. Aortic stenosis: The patient has significant aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 20 on echo.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, but the likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is low based on timing and stability of platelet count, with no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient was in atrial fibrillation, but is now in sinus rhythm. Ant"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. Postoperatively, he developed a myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes and angiographic findings indicating a likely culprit lesion in the left circumflex artery. He also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature and has resulted in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx artery. He is currently on heparin following the procedure. Other medical issues include acute systolic heart failure/acute MR, thrombocytopenia, aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, recent total hip surgery, anemia, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

Plan:
- Continue weaning dopamine as tolerated.
- Obtain preoperative echocardiogram if available for outpatient cardiologist/PCP.
- Consider repeat echo once weaned off IABP.
- Daily chest X-rays.
- Continue to follow thrombocytopenia.
- Discontinue amiodarone for atrial fibrillation"

The patient has undergone revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx artery. He is currently on heparin and being treated with multiple medications including statins, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors.

The patient is currently experiencing acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with acute severe MR, likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. Possible papillary muscle ischemia is also suspected. The IABP has been inserted to help with afterload reduction and improve MR, as well as increase coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents.

The patient has been weaned off Bivalirudin and is now on heparin. The plan is to obtain a preoperative echocardiogram if available to be sent to the outpatient cardiologist/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic pain, s/p total right hip replacement, and acute myocardial infarction. 

24-hour events include slow weaning off dopamine, initiation of a trial on a balloon pump, and transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.8 C (100.7 F), blood pressure ranging from 85/44 mmHg to 81/35 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, and a plateau pressure of 16 cmH2O.

Hemodynamic monitoring shows a central venous pressure (CVP) of 11 mmHg, pulmonary arterial pressures (PAP) of 46/22 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) of 6.7 L/min, cardiac index (CI) of 3 L/min/m2, and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) ranging from 63% to 67%. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,302 mL, output of 1,015 mL, and a net balance of 287 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 19.6 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 33%, platelet count (Plt) of 104 K/uL, blood glucose of 130 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, troponin-T of 2282 ng/mL, lactic acid of 1.2 mmol/L, albumin of 2.6 g/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1138 IU/L, calcium (Ca++) of 8.5 mg/dL, magnesium (Mg++) of 2.2 mg/dL, and phosphate (PO4) of 2.4 mg/dL.

Assessment and plan include pain control, acute and chronic pain management, and ongoing care in the ICU. The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to prolonged mechanical ventilation and the use of invasive lines and catheters.

2. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance and elevated CVP indicate a potential risk of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.

3. Organ dysfunction: The elevated troponin-T levels suggest ongoing myocardial injury, and the elevated LDH levels may indicate tissue damage. The patient's renal function, as indicated by the creatinine levels, appears to be compromised.

4. Thromboembolic events: The patient's immobility and history of hip replacement surgery increase the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

5. Barotrauma: The high plateau pressures and the use"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with an elevated CK level of 1516 (rising). The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and vasopressor support.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Acute systolic CHF/acute MR: The patient's heart failure and significant MR may worsen, leading to further deterioration of cardiac function.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to various causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemodynamic instability, or medication-related effects. Close monitoring of the platelet count and bleeding parameters is necessary.
3. Aortic stenosis: The patient has significant aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 20. This condition may contribute to further cardiac complications if not managed appropriately.
4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Monitoring for any changes in heart rhythm and managing it with anticoagulation therapy is essential.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient is"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in acute systolic heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient has undergone revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx). He is currently on heparin gtt and being weaned off pressor support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's significant MR and ischemic changes in the heart may lead to acute diastolic heart failure.
2. Acute Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's acute MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities may result in acute systolic heart failure.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI): The patient's history of MI and stenting procedures indicate underlying CAD. The ongoing chest pain and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest NSTEMI.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to thrombotic thrombocytopenic pur"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02
   who developed post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely
   culprit of LCx given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic
   findings. He has significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in
   nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to
   LCx
    - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]; will restart low dose captopril today for
   afterload reduction
    - Continue statin
   -  Trended CKs
 peak 2964 MB 220 on admission
   .
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR plus
   inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle
   ischemia. IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR,
   and also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   -  Off pressors
   -  Weaned peep to 5 to decrease afterload
 will attempt extubation
   today
   -  Plan for repeat echo next week
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and current
   stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   #. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
    - Presently in sinus
    - Discontinued amio
    - Anticoagulation with lovenox
   # RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Mechanical ventilation with volume control for now
   - currently on minimal vent settings, will extubate once hemodynamics
   improved
 PSV trial this am
   #. s/p Total Hip
    - will start anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - Have emailed his [**Last Name (LF) 6131**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] await response.
   #. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage)
   - f/u hemolysis labs - negative
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2002. Postoperatively, he developed myocardial infarction with a peak CK level of 2964 U/L, and likely had an occlusion in the left circumflex artery. He also has significant mitral regurgitation due to ischemic changes, resulting in acute heart failure and the need for mechanical ventilation. The patient's IABP was weaned off pressor support and removed. He received transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells due to inadequate bump and borderline blood pressure. Lasix was given intravenously due to volume overload. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 37.8 to 37.5 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 104 and 78 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 to 80/46 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22 and 15 inspirations per minute, oxygen saturation at 100%, and sinus tachycardia. His physical examination reveals pinpoint pupils, a 3/6 systolic murmur radiating to the apex, coarse breath sounds anteriorly, and no obvious tenderness in the abdomen. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male admitted to the ICU for management of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring continuous pressor support and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) therapy. The patient's hemodynamic status improved initially with IABP, but subsequently deteriorated, leading to the decision to wean and remove the IABP. The patient received a second unit of packed red blood cells due to inadequate hemoglobin concentration and borderline blood pressure. Lasix was administered intravenously to manage volume overload, which was repeated since the patient still appeared volume overloaded. 

Vital signs as of 05:46 AM on [**2153-3-17**] show a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F), heart rate of 104 bpm with a baseline of 78-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/61 mmHg to 123/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute with a baseline of 15-22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CPAP/PSV ventilation. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 11 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is 52/26 mmHg, cardiac output (CO) is 6.9 L/min, and mixed venous oxygen saturation"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is an 86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02
   who developed post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely
   culprit of LCx given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic
   findings. He has significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in
   nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor support
   .
   #. CAD/NSTEMI:  s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to
   LCx
    - On Bivalrudin peri-procedure now on heparin gtt
    - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **]; no BB or ACE since hypotensive on pressors
    - Continue statin
   - Trended CKs
 peak 2964 MB 220 on admission
   .
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR plus
   inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle
   ischemia. IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR,
   and  also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new  stents.
   s/p Anticoagluation with Bivalrudin through 2h after [**First Name3 (LF) **] load, now
   on heparin gtt
    - To obtain pre-op echo if available to outpatient cardiologist/PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **]  Dopamine Weaned overnight with MAP>55.
   -  Weaned peep to 5 to decrease afterload.
   -  consider repeat echo once weaned off IABP
   -  plan for IABP removal today
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and previous repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated CK levels and likely culprit left circumflex artery (LCx) involvement based on angiographic findings. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferiorolateral wall motion abnormalities. Possible papillary muscle ischemia.
2. Aortic Stenosis: Mean gradient by echo was 20, and echo suggested significant AS.
3. Thrombocytopenia: Low likelihood for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) based on timing and current stability of platelet count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm, discontinued amiodarone, and anticoagulation at present with heparin going forward for now.
5. Respiratory Failure/CHF: Mechanical ventilation with volume control for now, currently on minimal vent settings, will extubate once hemodynamics improved.
6. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Differential diagnosis includes hemolysis, bleed (RP since s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).
7. PPX: Lansoprazole daily Bowel regimen, heparin gtt.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK level of 2964, indicating a significant cardiac event. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) likely due to ischemic changes in the heart muscle, leading to heart failure. He required mechanical ventilation and was supported with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). The patient has undergone revascularization with two coronary stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx) following a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). His current medications include captopril, a statin, and beta-blockers, which are being titrated as tolerated. The patient's recent progress includes being extubated successfully and showing improvement in chest pain. However, he is now experiencing fever with a rectal temperature of 100.8 degrees Celsius, increased white blood cell count, and altered mental status. He also has thrombocytopenia but is stable, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure secondary to acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute MR, aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. The patient's family has been informed about his condition and the treatment plan."

The patient is also diagnosed with acute systolic heart failure and acute severe MR, which are likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. Possible papillary muscle ischemia has been suggested. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been inserted to help with afterload reduction and improve MR.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been experiencing various health issues. The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation/flutter with a heart rate of 120, which resolved after administration of 5mg IV metoprolol. However, the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to 74, and improved with a 250cc bolus. Later, the patient developed supraventricular tachycardia with a heart rate in the 90s and a temperature of 100.8 degrees Celsius, for which APAP was given and cultures were ordered.

The patient's allergies are unknown, and the last dose of antibiotics was given. The patient is on several infusions, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, furosemide (Lasix), and metoprolol. Other medications include Lasix and prophylactic antibiotics.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the noted events. The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature (Tmax): 38.2 degrees Celsius
- Heart rate (HR): 99 bpm
- Blood pressure (BP): 114/60 mmHg
- Respiratory rate (RR): 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation (SpO2): 99%

   afterload reduction
    - Continue statin
   -  Trended CKs
 peak 2964 MB 220 on admission
   .
   #. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR plus
   inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle
   ischemia. IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR,
   and also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   -  Off pressors
   -  Weaned peep to 5 to decrease afterload
 will attempt extubation
   today
   -  Plan for repeat echo next week
   .
   # AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent emergency surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. Post-operatively, he developed a myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac enzymes and underwent revascularization with Cypher stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely due to ischemic damage to the mitral valve, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was inserted to help with afterload reduction and increase coronary perfusion pressure. The patient's condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, aortic stenosis, respiratory failure, anemia, and recent total hip surgery. The patient is currently on multiple medications including heparin sodium, furosemide, metoprolol, lansoprazole, and statins.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic CHF/Acute MR: The patient's significant MR and ischemic heart damage may lead to further deterioration of heart function, resulting in acute systolic congestive heart failure.
2. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has significant aortic stenosis, which can worsen over time and potentially lead to cardiac complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He previously underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a significant ejection fraction (EF) loss. The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR) likely due to ischemic damage, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute Systolic Heart Failure/Acute MR: The patient's heart failure is likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferiolateral wall motion abnormalities. An IABP was inserted to reduce afterload and improve MR, as well as increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
2. Fever: The patient has a rectal temperature of 100.8 degrees Celsius, increased white blood cell count, and altered mental status. A chest X-ray was ordered to check for retrocardiac opacity, and empirical levofloxacin was started to treat possible infection. Urinalysis and urine culture were also ordered.
3. AMS/Delirium: The patient remains sedated with decreased responsiveness despite sedative medications being stopped. A head CT scan was ordered, along with a formal neurologic examination. Metabolic and infectious causes of delirium are being investigated.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who experienced a post-operative myocardial infarction after a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in 2002. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation likely due to ischemic heart failure, resulting in the need for mechanical ventilation. The patient underwent revascularization with two coronary stents to the left circumflex artery, which showed no signs of restenosis. 

The patient's current conditions include fever with an elevated white blood cell count, altered mental status, acute systolic congestive heart failure, acute severe mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure due to congestive heart failure, recent total hip repair, anemia, and possible pneumonia. 

Plan:
1. Continue levofloxacin for suspected pneumonia.
2. Follow-up cultures.
3. Hold further sedating medications.
4. Pain control with Tylenol for post-hip repair.
5. Repeat echocardiogram today.
6. Aim to keep even blood pressure.
7. Consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if hematocrit continues to trend down.
8. Continue lisinopril, beta blocker, and statin.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with an acute onset of mental status changes following the initiation of levaquin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and diuresis. The patient's friends report that he is generally weak at baseline. The patient has a history of total right hip replacement and myocardial infarction. Vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/65 mmHg to 117/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. Hemodynamic monitoring shows sinus tachycardia and fluid balance with a total input of 250 mL and output of 1370 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula. Physical examination findings are not assessed in peripheral vascular, skin, and neurologic domains. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hematocrit, slightly low platelet count, normal creatinine, and elevated D-dimer. Other lab values are within normal range or show no significant changes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's acute mental status changes could be indicative of delirium, especially considering the recent initiation of levaquin and diuresis.
2. UTI: The patient was started on levaquin for a UT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of mental status changes. The patient has a history of total right hip replacement and myocardial infarction. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 104 bpm, slightly elevated blood pressure, and normal respiratory rate and oxygen saturation. The patient has received levaquin for a urinary tract infection (UTI) and diuresed 1L negative. The patient's physical examination is largely not assessed due to mental status changes. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for slightly low potassium. The patient's renal function is normal. The patient's cardiac markers show elevated troponin-T and CK-MB levels, indicating ongoing myocardial injury. The patient has been on ICU care for pain control, nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's mental status changes could be indicative of delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infections, metabolic imbalances, or medication side effects.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function should be closely monitored due to the recent use of diuretics and the potential for AKI in critically ill patients"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:  s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to
   LCx with peak CK 2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lisinopril, beta blocker, and statin
   2. Fever:
   Rectal temperature 100.8, increased WBC count and patient with altered
   mental status. Etiology is unclear, differential includes pneumonia
   with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
   - continue levofloxacin for now
   - follow-up cultures
   .
   3. AMS/delirium: Yesterday was attributed to sedative meds and has now
   improved.  Likely worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR plus
   inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle
   ischemia. IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR,
   and also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   -  repeat echocardiogram today
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
    - Presently in sinus
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - will follow-up with primary orthopedic surgery team regarding
   anticoagulation
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with an elevated CK level of 1516, indicating myocardial damage. The infarction was likely caused by occlusion in the left circumflex artery (LCx), as evidenced by precordial and lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings.

The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure. He required mechanical ventilation and was supported with intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). The patient underwent revascularization with the placement of two Cypher drug-eluting stents in the LCx artery. His peak CK level after the procedure was 2964, and he remained free of chest pain.

Other medical conditions and concerns include:
1. Fever: The patient has an elevated rectal temperature of 100.8°F, increased white blood cell count, and altered mental status. The etiology is unclear, but possible causes include pneumonia with a retrocardiac opacity seen on chest X-ray. Levofloxacin therapy will be continued, and follow-up cultures will be done.
2. Altered mental status (AMS)/delirium: The patient's mental status improved after stopping sedative medications"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK level of 2964 and underwent revascularization using Cypher stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. The patient has been weaned off pressors and IABP support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever: The patient has a rectal temperature of 100.8, increased WBC count, and altered mental status. This may indicate an infection, and the patient has been empirically started on Levofloxacin to treat possible infection. Further evaluation with a chest X-ray and urine analysis is needed.
2. AMS/Delirium: The patient remains sedated with decreased responsiveness, which could be attributed to sedative medications. However, a CT head should be checked, along with a formal neuro exam, to rule out other causes of delirium such as metabolic or infectious causes.
3. Acute Systolic CHF/Acute MR: The patient likely has acute systolic heart failure and acute severe mitral regurgitation due to ischemic MR. This may"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. Postoperatively, he developed a myocardial infarction (MI) with an elevated CK level of 1516 (rising), suggesting a possible culprit lesion in the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP). He was successfully revascularized with Cypher (drug-eluting stents) in the LCx artery. Since then, he has remained free of chest pain.

The patient is currently experiencing fever, altered mental status, and an increased white blood cell count. A chest X-ray showed a possible retrocardiac opacity, leading to the empirical initiation of levofloxacin to treat a suspected infection. Urinalysis and urine culture have been ordered.

The patient's acute systolic heart failure and acute MR are likely related to ischemic MR and inferior/inferolateral wall motion abnormalities. An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has been inserted to help with afterload reduction and improve MR, as well as to increase coronary perfusion pressure through the new stents. The patient's aortic stenosis gradient is 20 mmHg, and he"

   Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
   increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
   space which most likely represents a fat pad.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:  s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to
   LCx with peak CK 2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lisinopril, beta blocker, and statin
   2. Fever:
   Rectal temperature 100.8, increased WBC count and patient with altered
   mental status. Etiology is unclear, differential includes pneumonia
   with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
   - continue levofloxacin for now
   - follow-up cultures
   .
   3. AMS/delirium: Yesterday was attributed to sedative meds and has now
   improved.  Likely worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. ACUTE SYSTOLIC CHF/Acute MR: Likely related to ischemic MR plus
   inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion abnormalities. Possible pap muscle
   ischemia. IABP inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR,
   and also to increase coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   -  repeat echocardiogram today
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
    - Presently in sinus
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - will follow-up with primary orthopedic surgery team regarding
   anticoagulation
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia.
- He underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction with elevated CK levels.
- The patient has significant mitral regurgitation, likely due to ischemia, resulting in heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump support.
- He underwent revascularization with Cypher stents in the left circumflex artery, which improved his symptoms.
- The patient's current conditions include fever, altered mental status, acute systolic heart failure with acute mitral regurgitation, aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia, atrial fibrillation, respiratory failure, and recent total hip surgery.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.0 C (98.6 F), blood pressure ranging from 100/57 mmHg to 78/42 mmHg, heart rate ranging from 93 to 130 bpm, respiratory rate ranging from 28 to 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, increased troponin-T, and elevated D-dimer levels.
- The patient is receiving various medications including lisinopril, beta-blockers, statins, levofloxacin, and pain control with Tylenol"

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK of 1516 (rising), likely due to left circumflex artery (LCx) disease. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx artery, and has remained chest pain-free.

Medical Complications:
1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient had a previous coronary artery disease (CAD) event, specifically a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which was treated with stent placement in the LCx artery. He is currently on medications including [Last Name (LF)], [First Name3 (LF)], lisinopril, beta-blocker, and statin.
2. Fever: The patient has an elevated rectal temperature of 100.8, increased white blood cell count, and altered mental status. The etiology is unclear, but possible differentials include pneumonia with retrocardiac opacity seen on chest X-ray. Levofloxacin has been continued for now, and follow-up cultures have been ordered.

   Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
   increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
   space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional
   dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe
   pulmlnary artery systolic hypertension. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent a revascularization procedure for a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). He has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) likely due to ischemic changes, resulting in heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. The patient also has a history of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and had a coronary angiography with placement of Cypher stents in the left circumflex artery (LCx). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has a history of NSTEMI and underwent revascularization with Cypher stents. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of cardiac complications.
2. Fever: The patient had an initial fever, but the trend has improved. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the fever.
3. AMS/delirium: The patient showed improvement in mental status, but there may be ongoing factors contributing to altered mental status, such as medication effects and possible pneumonia.
4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR: The patient has developed acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and severe mitral regurgitation (MR), likely related to ischemic changes and papillary muscle ischemia. Close monitoring and management are necessary to optimize cardiac function and prevent further complications.
5. Aortic stenosis: The patient has"

   - TTE as below
   - Intermittent episodes of SVT (AF vs AFlutter) to 130s. Dropped BP to
   70s with HR up to 130s. Bolused 250cc x 2 with improved SBPs 100s
   - Did not place NGT. Per discussion with nursing, pt will likely be
   able to tolerate PO. More awake and alert later in day. Have asked S/S
   to re-eval with repeat consult.
   - Hypernatremic to 150. Free water deficit 4.2L. Repleting with
   D51/2NS. Consider change to D5W
   - Increased metoprolol to 50 TID for rate control, beta blockade
   .
   Echo The left atrium is moderately dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
   There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with
   severe hypokinesis of the inferior and inferolateral walls. The
   remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 35 %). [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size and
   free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
   increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. The
   mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There
   is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior
   space which most likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional
   dysfunction c/w CAD. Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. Severe
   pulmlnary artery systolic hypertension. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   S: Thirsty. No CP, SOB, palpitations.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], lisinopril, beta blocker, and statin
   2. Fever:
   WBC and fever trend have improved. Etiology is unclear, differential
   includes pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR.
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   .
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Again now markedly improved. Thought likely related to medication
   affects and  likely worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - will follow-up with primary orthopedic surgery team regarding
   anticoagulation
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   11. Hypernatremia
   Likely related to free water depletion in the setting of being NPO.
   - free water repletion with D5W at 80mL
   - check q8h Na

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with elevated cardiac markers. The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature due to a blocked left circumflex artery (LCx). He also has severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, minimal aortic valve stenosis, and left ventricular cavity enlargement with regional dysfunction consistent with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient had a revascularization procedure with Cypher (DES) stents placed in the LCx artery. It is important to continue monitoring for any signs of ongoing ischemia or new cardiac events.
2. Fever: The patient had an unclear etiology of fever, which improved with antibiotics. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause, and appropriate treatment should be continued.
3. AMS/delirium: The patient experienced delirium, likely related to medication effects and possibly worsened by a possible pneumonia. It is important to continue treating the infection and avoid further sedating medications.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, Lisinopril 5, beta blocker 50 TID, and
   statin 80 lipitor
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis:
   WBC and fever trend have improved. Etiology is unclear, differential
   includes pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] have VAP/HAP
   nto adequately treated with levofloxacin since WBC trending up but
   still afebrile. Leukocytosis could also be stress response
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   -Vanc/Zosyn if spikes or WBC continues to trend up
   -Check sputum cx, C diff (has been on abx),
   -repeat blood cx and CXR to eval for new infiltrate
   .
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Again now markedly improved. Thought likely related to medication
   affects and  likely worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   - continue PT
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. Hypernatremia
   Likely related to free water depletion in the setting of being NPO.
   Diet now advanced
   - free water repletion with D5W at 120mL
   - check q6h Na
   -encourage free water intake
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.
   - D5W at 120; nectar thick liquids, ground solids, PO meds crushed with
   puree; 1:1 supervision

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia who underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK level of 1516, which was likely due to occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure. He required mechanical ventilation and an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, which has now been weaned off.

The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents placed in the LCx artery, and his peak CK level was 2964. He remains chest pain-free. The patient's current medications include Plavix 75, aspirin 325 mg, lisinopril 5 mg, beta-blocker 50 mg three times a day (TID), and statin 80 mg Lipitor.

The patient's other medical issues include fever and leukocytosis, which have improved but may be due to pneumonia or a stress response. Antibiotic therapy with levofloxacin is being continued for now. Additionally, the patient has atrial fibrillation, thrombocytopenia, aortic stenosis, respiratory failure, total hip surgery, anemia"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, Lisinopril 5, beta blocker 50 TID, and
   statin 80 lipitor
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis:
   WBC and fever trend have improved. Etiology is unclear, differential
   includes pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] have VAP/HAP
   not adequately treated with levofloxacin since WBC trending up but
   still afebrile. Leukocytosis could also be stress response
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn if spikes
   -Check sputum cx, C diff (has been on abx),
   -repeat blood cx and CXR to eval for new infiltrate
   .
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   - continue PT
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. Hypernatremia
   Likely related to free water depletion in the setting of being NPO.
   Diet now advanced
   - free water repletion with D5W at 120mL
   - check q6h Na
   -encourage free water intake
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He previously underwent surgery for a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak creatine kinase (CK) level of 1516, indicating significant cardiac damage. The culprit artery was the left circumflex (LCx), and the patient underwent revascularization with Cypher drug-eluting stents.

The patient also has severe mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure. He required mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, but the IABP has been weaned off pressor and IABP support.

The patient's current medical issues include:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD)/Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had a previous MI, and there is concern for ongoing ischemia. He has been revascularized with stents in the LCx artery. Medications such as lisinopril, beta-blocker, and statin should be continued.

2. Fever: The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and fever, but the etiology is unclear. Differential diagnoses include pneumonia, and there is a retro"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia. He underwent aortic aneurysm repair in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK of 1516. The culprit artery was the left circumflex artery (LCx), and he received revascularization with Cypher stents. He also had severe mitral regurgitation (MR) due to ischemic changes, leading to significant heart failure and requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support.

The patient has since been weaned off the pressor and IABP support. He had a second episode of NSTEMI with CK peak of 2964 MB and underwent another revascularization procedure with stent placement in the LCx artery. He has remained chest pain-free after the procedure.

The patient's current issues include fever and leukocytosis, which may be related to pneumonia or stress response. He is being treated with levofloxacin, and further cultures and investigations are planned. He also has acute systolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and acute MR, likely due to ischemic changes. An IABP has been inserted to help with afterload reduction and improve coronary perfusion pressure.

Other medical conditions include aortic stenosis, thrombocytopenia (low likelihood of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"

The patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who had a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK level of 1516. He underwent revascularization with Cypher stents to the left circumflex artery (LCx) and showed improvement in chest pain. The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure and requiring mechanical ventilation and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. He has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is on dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac complications: The patient's history of MI, significant MR, and ischemic heart failure puts him at risk for further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock.
2. Pulmonary complications: Mechanical ventilation and the presence of pulmonary edema increase the risk of pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
3. Renal complications: The patient's pre-existing CKD and potential hypotension due to heart failure can worsen renal function or lead to acute kidney injury (AKI).
4. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised state due to chronic illness and recent hospitalization increases the risk of infections, including catheter-related bloodstream infections or hospital"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 86-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) who developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a significant mitral regurgitation (MR) that is likely ischemic in nature. The patient also has significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and has undergone revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents to the left circumflex artery (LCx).

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he underwent revascularization with stent placement. It is important to continue the prescribed medications to prevent further cardiac events.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient had an initial fever and leukocytosis, which may indicate an infection. Although the fever has improved, the elevated white blood cell count suggests that there might still be an ongoing infection. Further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection, and appropriate antibiotics should be continued or adjusted based on culture results.

The patient is a 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and previous ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a rising CK level and likely culprit left circumflex artery (LCx). The patient also has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation. He has undergone revascularization with Cypher stents placed in the LCx artery.

The patient's current medical conditions include:

1. Coronary artery disease (CAD)/Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI): The patient had a previous MI and underwent revascularization with stent placement. He remains chest pain-free on a combination of antiplatelet, anticoagulant, beta-blocker, statin therapy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is increasing, and there is a concern for pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is currently on levofloxacin therapy, and follow-up cultures will be done. If the patient spikes, vancomycin and zosyn will be initiated.

   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical

   2. Fever/Leukocytosis:
   WBC and fever trend have improved. Etiology is unclear, differential
   includes pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] have VAP/HAP
   not adequately treated with levofloxacin since WBC trending up but
   still afebrile. Leukocytosis could also be stress response
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn if spikes
   -Check sputum cx, C diff (has been on abx),
   -repeat blood cx and CXR to eval for new infiltrate
   .
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep even

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, who had a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 2002 and developed post-operative myocardial infarction (MI) with a peak CK of 1516 (rising). He underwent revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents to the left circumflex artery (LCx), with subsequent improvement in symptoms. The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, leading to significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation, intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support, and weaning off pressor and IABP support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. CAD/NSTEMI: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), for which he underwent revascularization with DES stents. He remains chest pain-free, but ongoing management includes antiplatelet therapy (Plavix), aspirin, lisinopril, beta-blocker, and statin.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient initially presented with fever and leukocytosis, which improved but still requires further evaluation. Differential diagnosis includes pneumonia with retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or stress response. Treatment includes levofloxacin for now, follow-up cultures,"

   86 y/o male with HTN/Dyslipidema h/o rutured AAA in 02 who developed
   post-operative MI with CK 1516 (rising) with likely culprit of LCx
   given precordial/lateral ECG changes and angiographic findings. He has
   significant MR (new/severe) that is likely ischemic in nature,
   resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical
   ventilation, IABP now weaned off pressor and IABP support.
   .
   1. CAD/NSTEMI:
   s/p revascularization with Cypher (DES) stents x 2 to LCx with peak CK
   2964 MB 220.  Has remained chest pain free.
    - Continue Plavix 75, ASA 325, Lisinopril 5, beta blocker 50 TID, and
   statin 80 lipitor
   2. Fever/Leukocytosis:
   WBC and fever trend have improved. Etiology is unclear, differential
   includes pneumonia with ? retrocardiac opacity on CXR. [**Month (only) 51**] have VAP/HAP
   not adequately treated with levofloxacin since WBC trending up but
   still afebrile. Leukocytosis could also be stress response
   - continue levofloxacin for now to complete a 7 day course
   ([**Date range (1) 6212**]/09)
   - follow-up cultures
   - Vanc/Zosyn if spikes
   -Check sputum cx, C diff (has been on abx),
   -repeat blood cx and CXR to eval for new infiltrate
   .
   3. AMS/delirium:
   Improved. Thought likely related to medication affects and  likely
   worsened with possible pneumonia.
   - continue to treat infection with 7 day course of levofloxacin, expand
   abx as above
   - hold further sedating meds
   - Pain control with Tylenol for s/p hip repair.  Would avoid narcotics.
   4. Acute systolic CHF and acute MR:
   Likely related to ischemic MR plus inferior/inferiolateral wall  motion
   abnormalities with possible pap muscle ischemia and now s/p IABP
   inserted to help with afterload reduction to improve MR and increase
   coronary perfusion pressure through new stents.
   - aim to keep even
   5. AORTIC STENOSIS
    - Gradient by echo was mean of 20, echo suggested significant AS
   .
   6. Thrombocytopenia
 low likelihood for HIT based on timing and
   current stability of plt count, no evidence of thrombosis. Stable.
   - continue to follow
   .
   7. ATRIAL FIBRILLATION
   Presently in sinus, no afib/flutter overnight, improved rate control
   - Anticoagulation with lovenox SC BID
   - continue metoprolol TID
   8. RESPIRATORY FAILURE [**2-12**] CHF
   - Extubated on [**3-17**], doing well
   9. s/p Total Hip
    - continue anticoagulation/DVT prophy with lovenox
    - per OSH ortho, should be WBAT with posterior precautions
   - continue PT
   10. Anemia: Pt with dropping HCT post-op. Concern for bleed (RP since
   s/p cath, from hip post op, or GI given black NGT drainage).  Hct
   stable and bumped approx 2 after tranfusion.
   - consider scan hip/abd/pelvis if HCT continues to trend down
   - follow daily
   11. Hypernatremia
   Likely related to free water depletion in the setting of being NPO.
   Diet now advanced
   - free water repletion with D5W at 120mL
   - check q6h Na
   -encourage free water intake
   #. PPX:, Bowel regimen
   #. FEN : Hyper Na as above. Lyte repletion as needed.
   - D5W at 120; nectar thick liquids, ground solids, PO meds crushed with
   puree; 1:1 supervision

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient has been improving with D5W (5% dextrose in water) and is now 1L up for the last 2 days. There is a concern for possible pulmonary edema or vascular congestion.
- The patient is experiencing mouth dryness and difficulty speaking but does not have chest pain or shortness of breath.
- The patient has a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in 2002. He developed post-operative myocardial infarction with a CK (creatine kinase) level of 1516 (rising) and likely culprit left circumflex artery involvement.
- The patient has significant mitral regurgitation (MR), which is likely ischemic in nature, resulting in significant heart failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
- The patient underwent revascularization with Cypher (drug-eluting stents) to the LCx (left circumflex) artery with a peak CK-MB (creatine kinase-MB) level of 2964.
- The patient has been chest pain-free since the revascularization.
- The patient's fever and leukocytosis have improved, but the etiology is unclear. Differential includes pneumonia with a retrocardiac opacity on chest X-ray. The patient has VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia)/HAP (hospital-acquired pneumonia) not adequately"
