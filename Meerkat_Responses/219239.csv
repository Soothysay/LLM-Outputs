   fusion. Prior multiple suicide attempts with overdoses.  Sister
   believes that he overdosed on coumadin. Found down in room, couldn't
   talk, shaking, called EMS. Will need psych consult when stable
   - Tox consult: monitor INR, supportive care for lamictal overdose.
   - MRI/CAT head: old stable Rt frontal hygroma.
   MRI/CAT C-spine: stable post op c5-7 ant. fixation, no evidence
   cord injury (due to unwitnessed fall) hematoma, of FX.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 54-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home with empty bottles of Lamictal and Coumadin nearby, raising suspicion of an overdose. He has a history of multiple suicide attempts. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and concern for coumadin and Lamictal overdose.

The patient has been sedated and on mechanical ventilation due to unresponsiveness. His neurological examination shows clonus and hyperreflexia, but no seizures. The CT head shows an old stable right frontal hygroma, and the MRI/CAT C-spine demonstrates stable post-op C5-7 anterior fixation with no evidence of cord injury.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/72 mmHg to 152/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is intubated and sedated.

Laboratory results indicate mild leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated troponin T, and abnormal kidney function tests. The patient has also been diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and has an infiltrated propofol in the right forearm.

The patient's medical history includes"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home with empty bottles of Lamictal and Coumadin nearby, suggesting a possible overdose. He has a history of multiple suicide attempts and long-term alcohol use. The patient was intubated in the emergency department and admitted to the ICU for unresponsiveness and concern for coumadin and lamictal overdose.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 117/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. He is sedated and intubated, with an endotracheal tube in place. Physical examination reveals erythema over the left forearm, pupils equal and reactive, and no apparent scars or tenderness in the abdomen. Neurologically, the patient responds to commands, opens his eyes, squeezes hands, and exhibits jerky motion of both lower extremities.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal range. Imaging studies, including MRI and CAT scans, reveal a stable right frontal hygroma and no evidence of cord injury.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for alcohol withdrawal, pneumonia due to aspiration, and possible overdose of coumadin and lamictal. Sedation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home and intubated in the emergency department. The family suspects an overdose of Coumadin and Lamictal. The patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, pneumonia due to aspiration, depression with previous suicide attempts, and deep vein thrombosis. The patient's current condition includes toxic metabolic encephalopathy, possible lamictal overdose, and an old stable right frontal hygroma. The patient is currently sedated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Seizures: Due to the possible lamictal overdose, there is a risk of acute seizures within the first 48 hours.
2. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Given the pneumonia and aspiration, there is a risk of developing ARDS, which can lead to severe respiratory failure.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's liver function tests are elevated, which may indicate liver dysfunction. Hepatic encephalopathy can cause confusion, altered mental status, and other neurological symptoms.
4. Delirium tremens: As the patient has a history of alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of developing delirium tremens, characterized by severe agitation, hallucinations, and autonomic instability.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has a history of DVT, and immobilization in the ICU can increase"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home. He has a history of multiple overdose attempts in the past. The family suspected an overdose of Coumadin and Lamictal, but the patient's history remains unclear. He was intubated in the emergency department for unresponsiveness and concern for possible overdose.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, seizures): The patient has a history of alcohol use and is showing signs of withdrawal, including unresponsiveness and possible seizures.
2. Pneumonia, aspiration: The patient has evidence of aspiration pneumonia on chest CT and is being covered with antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn).
3. Infiltrated propofol: The patient developed an infiltrate in the forearm from propofol infusion.
4. Depression: The patient has a history of depression and previous suicide attempts. His current mental state is concerning for another suicide attempt.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient was diagnosed with DVT during a recent admission and was discharged on Coumadin, but the history is unclear and there is concern for overdose.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient may experience seizures due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy or a possible overdose of Lamictal.
2. Arrhythmias: The patient may develop arrhythmias due to Coumadin overdose or"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 54-year-old male who was found unresponsive at home and intubated in the emergency department for unresponsiveness and concern for coumadin and lamictal overdose. The patient has a history of four previous overdose attempts. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were as follows: temperature 37.7°C, heart rate 94 bpm, blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but was extubated earlier due to exhibiting generalized myoclonic jerks. The patient is unable to provide any further history of intake and is suspected to have a lamictal effect. A low dose of benzodiazepine may be tried. The patient was given 5mg IV Valium with minimal result, and the CIWA scale was started with 10mg IV. After three doses, the patient's heart rate decreased from 130s to 80s, and blood pressure decreased from 180s to 130s.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 68-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for overdose and altered mental status. The patient attempted suicide by taking lamictal and coumadin. He is currently on invasive ventilation and has been receiving benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The patient has pneumonia in the left lower lobe and is being treated with vancomycin. He has a history of DVT and will start subcutaneous heparin. The patient's neck pain is being evaluated for potential neck injury, and the C-collar has been removed. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 135/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient's lab results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, but liver enzymes are elevated. Imaging reveals pneumonia in the left lower lobe. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia in the left lower lobe, which can lead to further respiratory complications and potential sepsis if not treated appropriately.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT and is at risk for developing"

","Summary:
The patient is a 54-year-old male with a history of suicide attempts, admitted to the ICU due to an overdose of lamictal and coumadin. The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure and was intubated but is now extubated. The patient's INR levels have remained normal throughout. The patient has experienced intermittent myoclonic jerks since extubation, evaluated by neurology, and determined to be likely due to lamictal, not seizure activity. The patient requires benzodiazepines per CIWA. The plan includes a psychiatric evaluation, sitter today, and appears appropriate for floor transfer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Suicidality/Suicide Attempt: The patient admits to attempting to induce a coma by taking lamictal and coumadin. Suicide precautions should be continued, and a consultation with psychiatry is planned.
2. Alcohol Withdrawal (including Delirium Tremens, DTS, Seizures): The patient is responding well to benzodiazepines prn per CIWA, indicating ongoing management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
3. Pneumonia, Aspiration: The patient has a history of aspiration pneumonia. Further evaluation with PA and lateral chest X-ray is needed. Vancomycin may need to be discontinued if sputum culture is negative for MRSA.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of DVT. Pharmacodynamics"
