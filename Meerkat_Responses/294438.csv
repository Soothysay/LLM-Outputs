   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (10-15%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion (not hemorrhagic, no signs of aortic
   trauma).
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: believed to be chronic due to size; perhaps
   secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis), complication from pacemaker
   placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral pericarditis (patient had URI
   recently) or less likely due to malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.
   - monitor output from pericardial drain
   - consider pulling drain today
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture, cell count, studies
   - consider indomethacin if with chest pain secondary to effusion
   irritation
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE
   - f/u CXR
   - f/u EKG
   - avoid volume depletion, so as to avoid worsening tamponade physiology
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; extubated but
   then overnight needed to go up from shovel mask to BiPAP, now back on
   shovel mask.
   - f/u CXR
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated, as now extubated so closely watch O2
   requirement
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology so need volume on-board
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 1mg po daily
   - f/u daily rapamune level
   - f/u hepatology recs on [**12-2**] (monday)
   - consider why not on cellcept any more
   .
   # Rhythm - Afib:
   - at this time, holding anticoagulation and in fact reversing with
   vitamin K and FFP, are warranted due to the high risk of bleeding if
   these interventions do not occur
   - long-term chronic anticoagulation should be considered, but deferred
   for now
   - telemetry
   - restart rate control with home meds, but at lower dose, confirm med
   reconciliation with patient
s family
   .
   # CKD on HD:
   - resume regular HD schedule
   - renal meds continue
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability:
   - f/u ortho spine recs
   - continue c.collar
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   .
   # DVT prophylaxis: pneumoboots, hold on heparin SQ for now given bleed
   .
   # Glycemic control: Regular ISS
   .
   # Access: L femoral multilumen, left radial arterial line, right
   subclavian dialysis catheter, 20 gauge left forearm. Pull the femoral
   line today.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (A fib) on coumadin, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a history of liver transplant. The patient was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. He underwent an invasive procedure, cardiac catheterization, which resulted in bloody drainage and the placement of a drain.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/58 mmHg to 178/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient is alert and oriented, with clear understanding of the procedures performed.

The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi in both lungs, bruising on the right posterior shoulder, and 1+ deep pulse (DP) without edema. Neurological examination shows an alert and oriented patient.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.8 K/uL, elevated troponin-T levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's assessment and plan include monitoring of the pericardial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a complex medical history, including congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (10-15%), atrial fibrillation (A fib) on coumadin after recent ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a fall causing subarachnoid hemorrhage, cervical spine instability with widening at C6-C7, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion.

The patient's current condition includes invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation, and the presence of a pericardial drain following pericardiocentesis. The patient also has multiple lines and catheters in place, including a multi-lumen central line, arterial line, dialysis catheter, and peripheral IV.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's condition include worsening of CHF due to fluid overload, further respiratory failure requiring re-intubation, cardiac tamponade due to re-accumulation of pericardial effusion, infection of the pericardial fluid, pulmonary embolism from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and worsening of kidney function.

It is crucial to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, output from the pericardial drain, and fluid balance. Frequent assessments of the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and"

   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion: believed to be chronic due to size; perhaps
   secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis), complication from pacemaker
   placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral pericarditis (patient had URI
   recently) or less likely due to malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No
   evidence of infection at this time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid,
   suspect that it may be slow bleed from prior trauma from pacemaker
   placement.

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (EF), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), liver transplant, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cervical spine instability, and bleeding. The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to biventricular failure, pericardial effusion, pleural effusions, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a chronic pericardial effusion which may be secondary to uremia, pacemaker placement trauma, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. It was managed with pericardiocentesis, and the patient is being monitored for any signs of infection or reaccumulation of fluid.
2. Pleural effusions: The patient has persistent pleural effusions that are causing respiratory distress. Thoracentesis may be considered if the respiratory status worsens.
3. Respiratory status: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support with a shovel mask due to atelectasis and the presence of pleural effusions. Oxygen weaning will be done as tolerated.
4. Liver transplant: The patient is on sirolimus, and there is a low level detected today. Hepatology will provide further recommendations regarding the management of sirolimus levels.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has"

   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (10-15%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion (not hemorrhagic, no signs of aortic
   trauma).

   # Pericardial effusion: believed to be chronic due to size; perhaps
   secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis), complication from pacemaker
   placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral pericarditis (patient had URI
   recently) or less likely due to malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.
   - monitor output from pericardial drain
   - consider pulling drain today
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture, cell count, studies
   - consider indomethacin if with chest pain secondary to effusion
   irritation
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE

   then overnight needed to go up from shovel mask to BiPAP, now back on
   shovel mask.
   - f/u CXR
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated, as now extubated so closely watch O2
   requirement
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology so need volume on-board

   - f/u hepatology recs on [**12-2**] (monday)
   - consider why not on cellcept any more

   # Rhythm - Afib:
   - at this time, holding anticoagulation and in fact reversing with
   vitamin K and FFP, are warranted due to the high risk of bleeding if
   these interventions do not occur
   - long-term chronic anticoagulation should be considered, but deferred
   for now
   - telemetry
   - restart rate control with home meds, but at lower dose, confirm med

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction (10-15%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin after recent ablation, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis after a fall resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage, widening of C6-C7 without fracture, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion. 

The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and is currently monitored for output from the pericardial drain. The plan includes pulling the drain today, following up on pericardial fluid culture, cell count, and studies, considering indomethacin if experiencing chest pain secondary to effusion irritation, monitoring on telemetry, following up on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), chest X-ray (CXR), and electrocardiogram (EKG). The patient needs to be closely monitored for volume depletion to avoid worsening tamponade physiology.

The patient's respiratory status is unstable with pleural effusions. The plan includes following up on CXR, considering thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions worsen, weaning off oxygen as tolerated since the patient is now extubated, closely watching oxygen requirements, and avoiding diuresis due to tamponade physiology.

The patient is post-liver transplant and is on Rapamune (sirol"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (10-15%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today.
   - no antiplatelets/anticoagulation for now
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid; possible repeat
   echo today
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   - On carvedilol, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who states ok to hold for today given pt is at
   aspiration risk.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 1mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - f/u hepatology recs on [**12-2**] (monday)
   .
   # Rhythm - Afib: on metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - at this time, holding anticoagulation out of concern for bleed.  Will
   consider starting anticoagulation on dc.
   - telemetry
   - up-titrate carvedilol for BP control
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - f/u ortho spine recs
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   -hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with multiple medical conditions including congestive heart failure (CHF) with low ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation on coumadin after ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a fall causing subarachnoid hemorrhage, and a history of liver transplant. He is currently in the ICU due to several complications.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a chronic pericardial effusion, possibly secondary to uremia, trauma from pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. There is no evidence of infection at this time. A pericardiocentesis was performed, and the drain will be monitored. If the output tapers off, the drain will be removed.

2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient is on carvedilol and off metoprolol. Considering adding ACE-I orARB in the near future.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has pleural effusions and atelectasis. Thoracentesis may be considered if the respiratory status worsens. O2 weaning as tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 74-year-old man with a complex medical history including congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (EF), atrial fibrillation (A fib), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent liver transplant, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cervical spine instability, bleeding, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

The patient's current issues include impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion with tamponade, trauma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The medical team is addressing these conditions by providing appropriate interventions such as wound care, respiratory support, pericardiocentesis, and continuing with hemodialysis.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current conditions include:

1. Wound infection: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing wound infections. Proper wound care and monitoring are essential to prevent this complication.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's respiratory failure and the presence of pleural effusions increase the risk of developing pneumonia. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status and timely thoracentesis if necessary are important to prevent this complication.

3. Recurrence of pericardial effusion: Despite the pericardiocentesis performed, there is a possibility of recurrent pericardial effusion. Continuous monitoring of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of multiple medical conditions and recent trauma. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his health. The patient has impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and a subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is on several medications, including hydralazine and carvedilol for blood pressure control, pantoprazole for stress ulcers, and others for various conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires respiratory support with a face tent and has low urine output. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient is on dialysis and has multiple drains in place.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an underlying infection. Close monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
2. Bleeding: The patient's platelet count is decreased, and he has a history of recent trauma and subarachnoid hemorrhage. This puts him at an increased risk for bleeding complications. Careful monitoring of any bleeding symptoms and close coordination with the hematology team are necessary.

   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today.
   - no antiplatelets/anticoagulation for now
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid; possible repeat

   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   - On carvedilol, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who states ok to hold for today given pt is at
   aspiration risk.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 1mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - f/u hepatology recs on [**12-2**] (monday)
   .
   # Rhythm - Afib: on metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - at this time, holding anticoagulation out of concern for bleed.  Will
   consider starting anticoagulation on dc.
   - telemetry
   - up-titrate carvedilol for BP control
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes

   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   -hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (10-15%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), recent liver transplant, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
- The patient has been admitted to the ICU for various complications including pericardial effusion with tamponade, systolic heart failure, respiratory status with pleural effusions, impaired skin integrity, and trauma from pacemaker placement.
- The patient's current medications include carvedilol, hydralazine, pantoprazole, and sirolimus. 
- The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), leukocytosis, elevated cardiac enzymes, and impaired renal function.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, but he requires close monitoring due to his multiple medical conditions and ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial Effusion/Tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion that is believed to be chronic. There are several possible causes, including uremia, complications from pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, and the drain will be monitored closely. If the drainage output decreases, the drain may be removed.
2. Dilated"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (10-15%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin post recent ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) post fall complicated by subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7 widening without fracture, left thigh hematoma, and b/l pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.
- The patient underwent pericardiocentesis due to pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade, which is believed to be chronic and may be secondary to uremia, pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy.
- The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy and is on carvedilol, off metoprolol, with consideration to add ACE-I or another medication in the near future.
- The patient has respiratory status issues with persistent pleural effusions and atelectasis, and there is a consideration for thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens.
- The patient is a post-liver transplant patient on sirolimus, with low drug levels today, and is also not currently on cellcept.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is being held on anticoagulation due to"

The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple ongoing medical issues. The main concerns at the moment include:

1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a significant pericardial effusion, which may be due to uremia, trauma from pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. There is no evidence of infection, but the high red blood cell count in the fluid suggests a slow bleed from prior trauma. The plan is to continue monitoring the output of the drain and remove it when the output tapers off.

2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient is on carvedilol and will be evaluated for adding an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in the near future.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has persistent pleural effusions causing atelectasis. If his respiratory status worsens and the effusions worsen, a thoracentesis may be"

","Summary:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), pericardial effusion with tamponade, respiratory failure, and impaired skin integrity. He is currently in the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions.

24-hour events:
- The patient required hydralazine 10 mg x2 for blood pressure control and started on carvedilol. It is noted that he may need an uptitration of carvedilol due to his current medication, toprol XL.
- The low output of the drain is causing concern, and it may need to be pulled in the morning.
- An NG tube could not be placed today, and an IR-guided placement will be attempted in the morning. This is necessary because the patient is aspirating and needs to receive sirolimus.
- A follow-up with the liver fellow is planned in the morning regarding the sirolimus dose and the reason for discontinuing cellcept at OSH.
- Left upper extremity swelling was observed, and an ultrasound will be performed in the morning to assess the situation.

Allergies:
The patient has no known drug allergies.

Last dose of antibiotics:
The last dose of antibiotics was administered at [time].

Infusions:
The patient received pantoprazole (Protonix) at 08:38 PM and hydralazine at 10:30 PM.

   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today (150 cc overnight)
   - no antiplatelets, will go on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below,
   neurosurgery aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm pAfib, s/p AV node ablation. A sensed and
   P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiate carvedilol when NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - f/u ortho spine recs (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2776**] and any films which may need to be
   ordered
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   - hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   .
   # Aspiration:
   - NGT today for antiepileptic (prophylactic) meds
   - patient failed speech & swallow, they agree with NPO and NGT
   - IR assistance for NGT

","The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF) and low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin after recent ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a fall resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7 widening without fracture, left thigh hematoma, and bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion.

The patient's current condition includes:
- The need for pericardiocentesis and placement of a pericardial drain due to chronic pericardial effusion, possibly secondary to uremia, pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy.
- The requirement of heparin gtt for left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
- The initiation of carvedilol, pending the placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT), and consideration of adding an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or other medication in the near future.
- The presence of pleural effusions, atelectasis, and respiratory distress, with plans for thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens.
- Monitoring of liver transplant medications, specifically sirolimus, due to low levels.
- The continuation of anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation and the initiation of carvedilol once the NGT is in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   - plan to remove drain today, since <25-50 cc drainage/past 24 hours
   - no antiplatelets, on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below, neurosurgery
   aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm pAfib, s/p AV node ablation. A sensed and
   P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiate carvedilol when NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker
   - will ask PCP/cardiologist why patient has not been on ACEi
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - head CT today to ensure no progression while on heparin gtt
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - will order flexion and extension films, discuss results with ortho
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   - hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   .
   # Aspiration:
   - NGT today for antiepileptic (prophylactic) meds
   - patient failed speech & swallow, they agree with NPO and NGT
   - IR assistance for NGT

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, liver transplant, and recent subarachnoid hemorrhage. He is currently in the ICU for pericardial effusion and tamponade, which was managed with pericardiocentesis and drainage. Other ongoing issues include dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory status with pleural effusions, medication management post-liver transplant, cardiac rhythm control, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, and potential cervical spine instability.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient had a significant pericardial effusion leading to tamponade, which required pericardiocentesis and drainage. There is a possibility of recurrence or ongoing bleeding from the previous trauma or infection.
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with poor ejection fraction, making him at risk for heart failure exacerbation and arrhythmias.
3. Respiratory status: Pleural effusions can compromise respiratory function and lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation.
4. Medication management post-liver transplant: The patient requires careful monitoring and adjustment of immunosuppressive medications after liver transplantation.
5. Cardiac rhythm control: The patient's underlying atrial fibrillation needs to be managed with anticoagulation and rate control medications."

The patient is a 74-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin, recent ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), liver transplant, and a left thigh hematoma. He presented with bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion, which was drained via pericardiocentesis and now has a pericardial drain in place. The patient also has dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory status with pleural effusions, elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, aspiration, LUE swelling with DVT, and a recent subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Pericardial Effusion/Pericardial Tamponade: The patient had a pericardial effusion that was drained, but there is ongoing drainage. The cause of the effusion could be uremia, trauma from pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. The patient is at risk for recurrent effusion and tamponade physiology.

2. Dilated Cardiomyopathy: The patient has a history of CHF with a low ejection fraction. This condition can lead to heart failure symptoms, arrhythmias, and increased risk of sudden cardiac death.

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today (150 cc overnight)
   - no antiplatelets, will go on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below,
   neurosurgery aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm pAfib, s/p AV node ablation. A sensed and
   P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiate carvedilol when NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - f/u ortho spine recs (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2776**] and any films which may need to be
   ordered
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   - hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   .
   # Aspiration:
   - NGT today for antiepileptic (prophylactic) meds
   - patient failed speech & swallow, they agree with NPO and NGT
   - IR assistance for NGT
   # LUE swelling:  LUE US noted to have DVT
   - need heparin gtt, once therapeutic get head ct to eval for progress

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin post-ablation, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis post-fall resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage, widening of C6-C7 without fracture, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion that has been drained. The patient underwent dialysis in the morning, had a nasogastric tube placed with fluoroscopic assistance but fell out when the patient sneezed and wiped his nose. A drain was placed and not removed due to more than 50 cc output per day. Heparin was started for left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis with a goal of 50-70. A head CT was ordered in the morning to ensure no progression of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient's liver recommendations include increasing sirolimus to 2 mg per day, but the nasogastric tube is still not in place. The patient failed a speech and swallow evaluation.

Potential Medical Complications:

   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   -Once drain <25-50 cc drainage/24 hours, will remove; to be flushed
   today (150 cc overnight)
   - no antiplatelets, will go on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below,
   neurosurgery aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - continue q4 heparin flushes of drain
   - follow output and pull drain when output tapers off
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (EF), atrial fibrillation (A fib), chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), and post-liver transplant. He was admitted to the ICU due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), pleural effusions, pericardial effusion with tamponade, and a left upper extremity (LUE) DVT. The patient has undergone several procedures including AV node ablation, pericardiocentesis, and placement of a pericardial drain.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a chronic pericardial effusion believed to be secondary to uremia, pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. The effusion was drained, and a pericardial drain is in place. The plan is to continue regular monitoring of the drain output and remove it once the output is less than 25-50 cc per day. The drain will be flushed with heparin gtt to prevent clotting, and the patient will be monitored for any signs of infection.
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient will start carvedilol and discontinue metoprolol once the nasogastric tube (NGT) is in place."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on Coumadin, recent ablation, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis, liver transplant, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications and is on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a pericardial effusion that may be secondary to uremia, pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. The plan is to remove the drain today since there is less than 25-50 cc drainage in the past 24 hours. The patient is on heparin gtt for left upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with a poor ejection fraction. He will start carvedilol, pending NG tube placement, and will be off metoprolol. He will also add captopril.
3. Respiratory status: The patient has pleural effusions and atelectasis. He is currently sitting well and comfortable on a shovel mask. Oxygen weaning will be done as tolerated, and diuresis will not be initiated due to tamponade physiology.
4. Sirolimus level low: The patient is a liver"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.
   - plan to remove drain today, since <25-50 cc drainage/past 24 hours
   - no antiplatelets, on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below, neurosurgery
   aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - f/u pericardial fluid culture
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol
    - Consider adding ACE-I or [**Last Name (un) **] in near future.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis
   - consider thoracentesis if respiratory status worsens and effusions
   worsen
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm pAfib, s/p AV node ablation. A sensed and
   P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiate carvedilol when NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker
   - will ask PCP/cardiologist why patient has not been on ACEi
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - head CT today to ensure no progression while on heparin gtt
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - will order flexion and extension films, discuss results with ortho
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: unclear etiology however concern for aspiration
   pneumonitis.  No other focal sxs, white count down-trending, afebrile
   - hold abx for now.
   - trend WBC, fever curve
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   - f/u blood, urine cultures, c.diff
   .
   # Hypernatremia: will start D5W
   .
   # Aspiration:
   - NGT today for antiepileptic (prophylactic) meds
   - patient failed speech & swallow, they agree with NPO and NGT
   - IR assistance for NGT
   # LUE swelling:  LUE US noted to have DVT
   - need heparin gtt, once therapeutic get head ct to eval for progress

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation (A fib) on coumadin after recent ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD), s/p liver transplant, C6-C7 widening without fracture, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion. He underwent pericardiocentesis and is now with a pericardial drain. The patient has several medical complications, including pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade, dilated cardiomyopathy, respiratory status with pleural effusions, s/p liver transplant with low sirolimus level, rhythm with pAfib and AV node ablation, CKD on HD, systolic heart failure, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cervical spine instability, bleeding, elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, and aspiration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a chronic pericardial effusion, which could lead to cardiac tamponade. This can cause decreased cardiac output and hemodynamic instability.
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient's low ejection fraction indicates dilated cardiomyopathy, which can lead to heart failure symptoms and reduced cardiac output"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.  Pericardial fluid culture
   neg, AFP/anaerobic pending.
   - plan to remove drain today, since <25-50 cc drainage/past 24 hours
   - no antiplatelets, on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below, neurosurgery
   aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - f/u pericardial fluid cytology
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - f/u TTE for evaluation of residual pericardial fluid, perhaps in
   coming days
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, pending NGT, off metoprolol.
    - Add captopril.
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on shovel mask.  CXR shows persistent effusions,
   atelectasis.  Improving oxygen requirement.
   - O2 wean as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm pAfib, s/p AV node ablation. A sensed and
   P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiate carvedilol when NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker, starting ACEI
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - head CT today to ensure no progression while on heparin gtt
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure.
   - will order flexion and extension films, discuss results with ortho
   - continue c.collar until cleared by ortho
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again this AM.
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: resolved at this time, patient afebrile
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)
   .
   # Hypernatremia: will start D5
 NS (previously on NS)
   .
   # Aspiration:
   - NGT today for antiepileptic (prophylactic) meds
   - patient failed speech & swallow, they agree with NPO and NGT
   - IR assistance for NGT
   # LUE swelling:  LUE US noted to have DVT
   - need heparin gtt, once therapeutic get head ct to eval for progress

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin after ablation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) on hemodialysis (HD) after a fall resulting in a subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7 widening without fracture, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and now has a pericardial drain. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient has a chronic pericardial effusion, which may be due to uremia, complications from pacemaker placement, viral pericarditis, or malignancy. There is a risk of recurrent pericardial effusion or tamponade if the underlying cause is not addressed.

2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has dilated cardiomyopathy with poor left ventricular function. There is a risk of worsening heart failure symptoms and cardiac dysfunction if not managed properly.

3. Respiratory status: The patient has pleural effusions causing respiratory distress. There is a risk of further respiratory compromise if the effusions are not addressed.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has evidence of a left upper extremity DVT. There is a"

","The patient is a 72-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of dysphagia, deep vein thrombosis in the upper extremity, impaired skin integrity, respiratory failure, pericardial effusion with tamponade, trauma, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/64 mmHg to 104/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support but not receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's arterial blood gas values are pending. The peripheral pulses in both upper and lower extremities have not been assessed. The patient's neurologic examination is also incomplete.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, along with abnormal kidney function tests (creatinine) and liver function tests. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, but there are abnormalities in potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

The patient has been on heparin sodium infusion, and other ICU medications have been administered as well. The patient's nutritional status is replete with fiber, and glycemic control measures have been taken.

The patient's medical history includes possible contraindications for ACE inhibitors, and outpatient"

   Assessment and Plan
   74 yo man with CHF and low EF (25-30%), A fib on coumadin s/p recent
   ablation, CKD on HD s/p fall c/b subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7
   widening w/o fracture, left thigh hematoma, found to have b/l pleural
   effusions and pericardial effusion, s/p pericardiocentesis and now with
   pericardial drain.
   .
   # Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: believed to be chronic
   due to size; perhaps secondary to uremia (requiring dialysis),
   complication from pacemaker placement (bleed/trauma), or due to viral
   pericarditis (patient had URI recently) or less likely due to
   malignancy; s/p pericardiocentesis.  No evidence of infection at this
   time.  Given high RBC ct in fluid, suspect that it may be slow bleed
   from prior trauma from pacemaker placement.  Pericardial fluid culture
   neg, AFP/anaerobic pending.
   - drain removed yesterday
   - no antiplatelets, on heparin gtt for LUE DVT (see below, neurosurgery
   aware, PTT goal 50-70)
   - f/u pericardial fluid cytology
   - consider indomethacin if needed for pericardial pain
   - monitor on telemetry
   - TTE today showed - LV systolic function appears depressed. RV with
   depressed free wall contractility. There is no aortic valve stenosis.
   There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.  Compared with the
   prior study (images reviewed) of [**2165-11-30**], no change.
   .
   # Dilated cardiomyopathy
   -  Will start carvedilol, Diovan now that NGT is in
   .
   # Respiratory status: Patient with pleural effusions; now satting well
   and comfortable on RA.  CXR shows persistent effusions, atelectasis.
   Improving oxygen requirement.
   -continue off O2 as tolerated
   - not diuresing given tamponade physiology
   .
   # s/p liver transplant:  sirolimus level low today.  Discussed with
   hepatology fellow who wanted to increase sirolimus dosing to 2 mg daily
   once NGT in place.  Unclear why pt is not on cellcept anymore, however
   hepatology is contacting [**Name2 (NI) **] provider who made the change and will
   f/u with recs.
   - continue Rapamune (sirolimus) 2mg po daily, will need NG tube to
   receive doses or switch to sirolimus syrup (same dose)
   - appreciate hepatology recs above
   .
   # Rhythm
 underlying rhythm currently sinus, s/p AV node ablation. A
   sensed and P paced. On metoprolol 100 xl [**Hospital1 **] at home
   - now on anticoagulation given LUE DVT.
   - telemetry
   - initiated carvedilol with NGT in place
   .
   # CKD on HD: HD started 3 wks ago. Renal following, appears euvolemic
   - resume regular HD schedule (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
   - renal dose meds
   - f/u renal recs
   - daily electrolytes, renal addressing hypernatremia, hypokalemia
   .
   # Systolic heart failure: Poor EF, currently stable.
   -continue bblocker, starting ACEI
   -holding statin given liver transplant
   .
   # Subarachnoid hemorrhages:
   - head CT yesterday was negative for new hemorrhage, showed expected
   evolution of old
   - neuro checks q4h
   - HOB elevation
   - f/u neurosurgery recs
   - continue keppra [**Hospital1 **] for seizure prevention
   .
   # C6-C7 widening; cervical spine instability: may require c-spine
   stabilization procedure which patient refused at this time.
   - will order flexion and extension films concerning for anterior
   longitudinal ligament injury
   - continue c.collar for at least 6 weeks
   - needs to bee seen in two weeks by ortho, appointment to be made based
   on number in chart from ortho attending note
   .
   # Bleeding: s/p FFP and vitamin K; evidence on CT, stable anemia since
   admission.
   - hold coumadin, asa
   - daily Hct, stable today
   - guiac stool
   .
   # Elevated cardiac enzymes: now trending downward, were likely elevated
   in setting of demand ischemia from trauma, bleeding, transient
   hypotension. Rose again [**11-30**].
   - no need to redraw as long as clinical picture stable
   .
   # Leukocytosis: resolved at this time, patient afebrile
   - no evidence of pna on CXR
   - monitor closely d/t chronic immunosuppression (secondary to s/p liver
   transplant)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of congestive heart failure, low ejection fraction (25-30%), atrial fibrillation on coumadin after recent ablation, chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis (HD) after a fall resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage, C6-C7 widening without fracture, left thigh hematoma, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion. He underwent pericardiocentesis and had a pericardial drain placed. The patient's recent interventions include removal of the pericardial drain, placement of a nasogastric tube (NGT), initiation of tube feeds, and insertion of an arterial line. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pericardial effusion/pericardial tamponade: The patient had a chronic pericardial effusion that required pericardiocentesis. There is suspicion of a slow bleed from prior trauma related to pacemaker placement or viral pericarditis. The patient's pericardial fluid culture is negative, and further follow-up is planned. 
2. Dilated cardiomyopathy: The patient has a low ejection fraction and will start carvedilol and Diovan. 
3. Respiratory status: The patient has persistent pleural effusions and atelectasis, but oxygen requirement is improving. 
4. CKD on HD: The patient's renal"
