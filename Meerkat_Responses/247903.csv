   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has several medical complications including renal failure, anemia, hypertension, gastritis, hypothyroidism, dementia, coronary artery disease, and lung nodules.

The patient's current assessment includes septic shock, acute renal failure, and hematuria. The source of the sepsis is suspected to be either the urinary tract or the lungs. The patient is experiencing hypoxia, tachypnea, and opacities in the lungs, which may indicate airspace disease.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.5Â°C
- Heart rate: 80 bpm
- Blood pressure: 139/77 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 20 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 97% on nasal cannula

The patient's laboratory results show:
- White blood cell count: 20.1 K/uL
- Hematocrit: 27.1
- Platelet count: 158 K/uL
- Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL
- Blood glucose: 108 mg/dL
- Troponin T: 0.11
- Lactic acid: 1.9 mmol/L

The patient's imaging results reveal right hydronephrosis, right hydroureter, a possible soft tissue mass obstruction"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male presenting with septic shock of likely pulmonary or urinary origin, acute renal failure, anemia, hypertension, gastritis, and hypothyroidism. The patient's condition is critical, and several potential medical complications can arise. 

Firstly, the patient's septic shock requires immediate attention. The source of infection is still being investigated, with the urinary tract and lungs being the most likely sources. The patient has already been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover nosocomial sources, but specific antibiotics will depend on the results of blood cultures.

Secondly, the patient has acute renal failure (ARF), which may be due to hypotension, post-renal causes (obstruction), or pre-renal causes. Further imaging, such as an MRI, is needed to evaluate the right renal complex cyst. The patient's creatinine levels will need to be closely monitored, and urine output should be maintained above 30cc/hr.

Thirdly, the patient's hematuria may be traumatic, especially after the replacement of the Foley catheter. Coagulation levels are within normal limits, so close monitoring is recommended.

Fourthly, the patient experienced a syncopal event, but the EKG did not show any acute events. Troponin levels are elevated in the setting of ARF, so cardiac enzymes should be trending regularly.

Fifthly, the patient has a history of gastric ulcer, which is associated with H. pylori"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a [age]-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has a history of dementia, coronary artery disease (CAD), and hypertension. 

Upon admission, the patient was found to have right hydronephrosis and hydroureter on renal ultrasound. There was also a soft tissue mass obstruction noted, with no stones present. Multiple small right renal cysts were observed, along with a large exophytic lesion containing fluid levels. Urology consultation has been requested.

The patient's blood cultures showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. The patient has been treated with antibiotics, including metronidazole and vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.5Â°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/77 mmHg to 162/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen delivery.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count of 20.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.4 g/dL, hematocrit of 27.1%, platelet count of 158 K/uL, creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 108 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated troponin-T levels. Imaging studies reveal right hydronephrosis, hydroureter, and a soft tissue mass obstruction in the urinary tract.

The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, acute renal failure, anemia, benign hypertension, gastritis, and hypothyroidism. The patient's medical and family history are limited due to deafness and dementia.

Plan:

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition support and glycemic control. The patient is on prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. Further management and treatment plans are pending the results of the urology consultation and ongoing monitoring of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with a chief complaint of septic shock. The patient has several medical conditions including renal failure, anemia, hypertension, gastritis, and hypothyroidism. 

The patient's recent events include an ultrasound that revealed right hydronephrosis, right hydroureter, and a possible soft tissue mass obstruction. There are also multiple small right renal cysts with a large exophytic lesion containing fluid. The patient has undergone multiple blood cultures which showed gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci in pairs and chains. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5 C (97.7 F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/77 mmHg to 162/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and lactate levels. The imaging suggests a possible urinary tract infection as the source of sepsis. 

The patient's plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, monitoring mean arterial pressure (MAP) goal above 60-65, central venous pressure (CVP) goal between 8-26, urine output goal above 30cc/hr, and gentle fluid bolus. Further imaging and consultation with u"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an elderly male who presented with fevers, hypotension, and concerns for urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, hypotension, and acute renal failure. He is currently in the ICU and is being treated with multiple antibiotics, fluids, and pressors to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion. The patient has a history of hypertension, gastritis with a gastric ulcer, hypothyroidism, dementia, coronary artery disease, and is currently on several medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Urosepsis: The patient initially presented with concern for urosepsis, which is a severe infection in the urinary tract that can lead to sepsis. This condition can cause symptoms such as fever, hypotension, and kidney dysfunction.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, likely pre-renal due to rapid improvement. Pre-renal acute kidney injury occurs when there is a decrease in blood flow to the kidneys. This can be caused by conditions such as dehydration or sepsis.

3. Sepsis-related Organ Dysfunction: Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction in various systems, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, and hepatic systems. The patient's respiratory support and abnormal lab values suggest potential sepsis-related organ dysfunction.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows bibasilar hazy opacities,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old individual presenting with fevers, hypotension, and concern for urosepsis. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock and is currently receiving treatment for it. They also have acute renal failure and are being closely monitored for any further complications. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Persistent or worsening septic shock: The patient's condition needs to be closely monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to maintain hemodynamic stability.

2. Kidney injury or chronic kidney disease: The patient has hydroureter and hydronephrosis, which may lead to further renal damage if not appropriately managed.

3. Pneumonia: The patient's chest X-ray shows bibasilar hazy opacities, which could indicate the presence of pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be necessary.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although not explicitly mentioned, the patient has been placed on prophylaxis for DVT. Regular assessment for signs and symptoms of DVT is important.

5. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of gastric ulcer and is on acid suppression therapy. Monitoring for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding is crucial.

6. Cardiac events: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and slightly elevated troponin levels. Continuous monitoring for signs of cardiac ischemia or myocardial infarction is necessary"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo male p/w SIRS/sepsis of likely pulm of urinary source, ARF, and
   hematuria.
   .
   #. SIRS/sepsis:  Hypotension and hypothermia have resolved at this
   point.  Most likely sources include GU tract proteus, though source of
   gram negative rods on one blood culture is unclear vs. pna given
   initial hypoxia, tachypnea and opacities in lungs.  ABG 7.40/28/56/18.
   Tachypnea likely compensatory for metabolic acidosis as well as [**2-16**]
   hypoxia.  Hypoxia likely [**2-16**] airspace disease.  Anion Gap likely from
   lactate and arf, currently closed.  Recent ulcer clipping is concerning
   for GI source, though abdomen is nontender.  CVL placed.  Antibiotics
   covering nosocomial sources.  Micro data suggest GU source, septic
   shock [**2-16**] UTI.
   - elevation in white count, likely hemo concentration given other three
   lines also up.
   - f/u U/A, BCx, UCx
   - continue broad spectrum antibiotics with vanc/cefepime/levo, while we
   await speciation of BCX
   - surveillance cultures
   - some concern for abscess on renal u/s, follow-up CT with IV contrast
   today
   .
   #. HTN: Restarted metoprolol in place of atenolol, holding of on
   atenolol given that its renally cleared.  Given rapidly dropping
   creatinine GFR cannot be estimated (not steady state) therefore would
   assume normal renal function based on UOP, post ATN diuresis.  Would
   use hydral prn for sbp>180.
   - consider converting metoprolol to labetalol
   .
   # Tachycardia:  ? of MAT on EKG, would increase beta-blockade for rate
   control, and limit anxiety with home risperadol, add zydis if
   necessary,
   ,
   #. ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8 upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-24**], though he may
   have had an admission to the [**Hospital1 318**] in between for ARF.  Unclear
   cause.  ? ATN from hypotension.  Unclear if he received dyeload.
   Currently resolving with massive autodiuresis (likely post-ATN
   diuresis), await urology input re: imaging for ? of IR guided biopsy of
   right ureteral mass.  Less acute given overall clinical improvement.
   - follow Cr, UOP
   - urine lytes
   - Restarted terazosin
   - consider further imaging for eval of right renal complex cyst,
   appreciate Urology recs
   .
   #. hematuria: suspect traumatic cause with replacement of foley.  Coags
   wnl.  Resolved this morning.
   - discontinued CBI with three way foley, cont to monitor
   - Urology consult, appreciate recs
   - In setting of PSA of 180, suspect prostate CA, will attempt to obtain
   VA records, urology to comment
   .
   #Hypernatremia
 suspect massive low solute auto-diuresis as the cause,
   would encourage PO water today.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #. ? syncopal event: ekg unconcerning for acute event.  Elevated trop
   in setting of ARF as below and nl CK/CKMB.
   - trend CEs -> currently trending down
   - monitor on tele
   .
   #. gastric ulcer: h. pylori positive by serology but not biopsy of
   ulcer, planned for when he is more stable. Guaiac negative and benign
   abd exam.
   - PPI
   - f/u EGD with biopsy after medically stable
   .
   #. lung nodules: CT vs f/u CXR as outpatient
   .
   #. Hypothyroid: cont levothyroxine
   .
   #  dementia: cont donepezil and prn antipsychotics for agitation

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of SIRS/sepsis of likely pulmonary or urinary source, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from his current conditions and treatments. These potential complications include:

1. SIRS/Sepsis: The patient is at risk for further deterioration due to the ongoing infection. If not properly managed, this can lead to septic shock and organ failure.

2. ARF: The patient's renal function is compromised, and there is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to hypotension. This may result in electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload. Continuous monitoring of kidney function and fluid balance is necessary.

3. Hematuria: The cause of hematuria needs to be further evaluated, considering the possibility of a traumatic cause related to Foley catheter replacement or a more serious underlying condition like prostate cancer.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has an elevated sodium level, which may be due to massive low solute auto-diuresis. Encouraging oral water intake is recommended to correct this imbalance.

5. Hypothyroidism: The patient is on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism, and regular monitoring of thyroid function is required.

6. Gastric ulcer: The patient has a history of an H. pylori-positive gastric ulcer."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with SIRS/sepsis of likely pulmonary or urinary source, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria. The patient's blood pressure and hypothermia have resolved. The most likely source of infection is the GU tract, but the source of gram-negative rods on one blood culture is unclear. The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely due to hemoconcentration.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.40, indicating normal acid-base balance. The patient's tachypnea is likely compensatory for metabolic acidosis as well as airspace disease. The anion gap is likely from lactate and ARF, currently closed.

The patient has been diagnosed with hypertension and is being treated with metoprolol. The use of atenolol is being held off due to its renally clearance. Labetalol may be considered as an alternative. The patient's ARF is currently resolving with massive autodiuresis. Further imaging and urology input are needed to evaluate the right ureteral mass.

The patient has hematuria, which is suspected to be traumatic due to the replacement of the Foley catheter. Coagulation results are within normal limits. The Foley catheter has been discontinued, and a urology consult has been appreciated.

The patient also has hypernatremia, which is suspected to be caused"

","The patient is a 79-year-old male admitted to the ICU with hypotension and fever. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 36.7Â°C (98.1Â°F), heart rate 94 bpm, blood pressure 212/76 mmHg, respiratory rate 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100%. The patient has been diagnosed with septic shock, likely due to a urinary source, and is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient's renal function has improved, but there is still a need for close monitoring of electrolytes and fluid balance.

The patient has a history of hypertension, for which they were previously taking atenolol and lisinopril but were holding the medications. Now, the patient is restarting beta-blockers and low-dose captopril. The patient also has a history of tachycardia and arrhythmia, for which they will continue on beta-blockers.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is now rapidly improving. Monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status is crucial in this case. Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, which needs to be addressed with encouragement of free water intake.

The patient's hematuria and elevated PSA levels need to be discussed with urology, as the hematuria has resolved and the patient is off of CBI. The patient's history of gastritis and peptic ulcer disease should continue with acid suppression, and"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:
- The patient presented with hypotension and fever.
- Blood cultures showed positive results with GNRs and GPCs, indicating a likely urinary source of infection.
- The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- There is evidence of septic shock, as indicated by hypotension and hypothermia, but these symptoms have now resolved.
- The patient has hypertension, which has been managed with atenolol and lisinopril. However, the patient is hypertensive again, so beta-blockers will be uptitrated as needed, and low-dose captopril will be started.
- The patient also has tachycardia and an irregular rhythm, which will be monitored, and beta-blockers may be used for treatment.
- The patient has acute renal failure, likely pre-renal or mild acute tubular necrosis, and is rapidly improving. Monitoring of electrolytes and fluid status will continue.
- The patient has hypernatremia, and encouragement of free water intake is recommended.
- The patient has hematuria and an elevated PSA, but the hematuria has resolved, and follow-up with urology will be done for the PSA.
- The patient has a history of gastritis, ulcer, hypothyroidism, dementia, and coronary artery disease. Appropriate medications and treatments are being continued or restarted.
- The patient's ICU care includes oral diet, glycemic"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo male p/w SIRS/sepsis of likely pulm of urinary source, ARF, and
   hematuria.
   .
   #. SIRS/sepsis:  Hypotension and hypothermia have resolved at this
   point.  Most likely sources include GU tract, though source of gram
   negative rods on one blood culture is unclear vs. pna given initial
   hypoxia, tachypnea and opacities in lungs.  Growing Proteus in urine,
   and enterococcus in blood and urine, as well as other GNR in blood
   (maybe proteus). WBC stable.
   - f/u GNR speciation
   - cont vanco for enterococcus, consider changing to cipro for
   proteus/GNR and D/C levaquin/cefepime
   - surveillance cultures
   .
   #. HTN: Restarted metoprolol in place of atenolol, holding of on
   atenolol given that its renally cleared.  Given rapidly dropping
   creatinine GFR cannot be estimated (not steady state) therefore would
   assume normal renal function based on UOP, post ATN diuresis.
   Uptitrating captopril had little effect, labetalol also minimal effect.
   - consider hydral prn vs. uptitrating labetalol, however patient
   asymptomatic with stable MS and no signs of end organ damage
   - consider alternate etiologies of refractory hypertension ie further
   eval of renal cyst
   .
   # Tachycardia:  MAT on EKG, would increase beta-blockade for rate
   control, and limit anxiety with home risperadol, add zydis if
   necessary.
   ,
   #. ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8 upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-24**], though he may
   have had an admission to the [**Hospital1 318**] in between for ARF.  Unclear
   cause.  ? ATN from hypotension.  Unclear if he received dyeload.
   Currently resolving with massive autodiuresis (likely post-ATN
   diuresis),
   - follow Cr, UOP
   - Restarted terazosin
   - PSA elevated, pt likely has prostate CA and may need CTU to eval for
   obstruction (when [**Last Name (un) **] resolved)
   - appreciate urology recs
   .
   #. hematuria: suspect traumatic cause with replacement of foley.  Coags
   wnl.  Resolved this morning.
   .
   #Hypernatremia
 suspect massive low solute auto-diuresis as the cause,
   would encourage PO water today. Improved with encouraging water
   yesterday.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #. ? syncopal event: ekg unconcerning for acute event.  Elevated trop
   in setting of ARF as below and nl CK/CKMB, trending down.
   .
   #. gastric ulcer: h. pylori positive by serology but not biopsy of
   ulcer, planned for when he is more stable. Guaiac negative and benign
   abd exam.
   - PPI

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical issues including SIRS/sepsis of likely pulmonary or urinary source, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria. The patient's vital signs include a blood pressure of 193/104 mmHg, heart rate of 99 bpm, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula, and temperature within normal range. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal kidney function tests.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions including hypertension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, hematuria, hypernatremia, possible syncopal event, gastric ulcer, lung nodules, hypothyroidism, dementia, and a history of prostate cancer.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening of sepsis and septic shock, further decline in kidney function leading to acute kidney injury or end-stage renal disease, progression of ARF to chronic kidney disease, development of complications related to the gastric ulcer such as bleeding, worsening of hypertension leading to cardiovascular events, and potential progression of lung nodules into malignancy.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and overall clinical condition to promptly address any emerging complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo male p/w SIRS/sepsis of likely pulm of urinary source, ARF, and
   hematuria.
   .
   #. SIRS/sepsis:  Hypotension and hypothermia have resolved at this
   point.  Most likely sources include GU tract given hydronephrosis.
   Growing Proteus in urine, and enterococcus in blood and urine, as well
   as other GNR in blood (maybe proteus). WBC stable. GI tract is another
   concerning area since pt continues to have diarrhea.
   - f/u GNR speciation
   - cont vanco for enterococcus, change to cipro for proteus/GNR and D/C
   levaquin/cefepime
   - surveillance cultures
   .
   #. HTN: Restarted metoprolol in place of atenolol, holding of on
   atenolol given that its renally cleared.  Given rapidly dropping
   creatinine GFR cannot be estimated (not steady state) therefore would
   assume normal renal function based on UOP, post ATN diuresis.
   Uptitrating captopril had little effect, labetalol also minimal effect.
   Patient anxiety seems to be contributing, although he denies any pain
   or anxiety.  Patient asymptomatic with stable MS and no signs of end
   organ damage
   - continue to uptitrate Captopril and metoprolol to max, then consider
   3^rd [**Doctor Last Name **] (ie hydral)
   - avoid alpha-blockers since on terazosin
   - control anxiety/delirium with risperidone and zyprexa prn
   .
   # Tachycardia:  MAT on EKG, improved control with increase
   beta-blockade, and limit anxiety with home risperadol, add zydis if
   necessary.
   ,
   #. ARF: Baseline Cr 0.8 upon discharge from [**Hospital1 **] on [**1-24**], though he may
   have had an admission to the [**Hospital1 318**] in between for ARF.  Unclear
   cause.  ? ATN from hypotension.  Unclear if he received dyeload.
   Currently resolving with massive autodiuresis (likely post-ATN
   diuresis),
   - follow Cr, UOP
   - Restarted terazosin
   - PSA elevated, pt likely has prostate CA and may need CTU to eval for
   obstruction (when [**Last Name (un) **] resolved)
   - appreciate urology recs
   .
   #. hematuria: suspect traumatic cause with replacement of foley.  Coags
   wnl.  Resolved
   .
   #Hypernatremia
 suspect massive low solute auto-diuresis as the cause,
   would encourage PO water today. Improved with encouraging water
   yesterday.
   - [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   .
   #. ? syncopal event: ekg unconcerning for acute event.  Elevated trop
   in setting of ARF as below and nl CK/CKMB, trending down.
   .
   #. gastric ulcer: h. pylori positive by serology but not biopsy of
   ulcer, planned for when he is more stable. Guaiac negative and benign
   abd exam.
   - PPI
   - f/u EGD with biopsy after medically stable
   .
   #. lung nodules: CT vs f/u CXR as outpatient
   .
   #. Hypothyroid: cont levothyroxine

   #  dementia: cont donepezil and prn antipsychotics for agitation

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 90+ year old male with multiple medical complications. The patient presented with SIRS/sepsis of likely pulmonary or urinary source, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria. 

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. SIRS/sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, including hypotension and hypothermia. The source of infection is suspected to be from the urinary tract due to hydronephrosis. Cultures showed growth of Proteus in the urine and enterococcus in the blood and urine. Other Gram-negative rods (GNR) were also found in the blood.

2. ARF: The patient's baseline creatinine level upon discharge from the hospital was 0.8, but it may have been higher during a previous admission for ARF. The cause of ARF is unclear, possibly due to hypotension or another underlying condition. The patient is currently resolving with massive autodiuresis, which is likely post-acute tubular necrosis (ATN) diuresis.

3. Tachycardia: The patient had tachycardia, which improved with increased beta-blockade and limiting anxiety with home risperidone. 

4. HTN: The patient's hypertension was initially managed with atenolol, but it was replaced with metoprolol due to its renal clearance. The patient's blood pressure"

   Assessment and Plan
   SEPTIC SHOCK
  Hypotension and hypothermia now resolved, blood
   cultures w/GNRs and GPCs, Proteus in urine.  Concern for urinary
   source, although polymicrobial sepsis suggests potetial GI source
   (bowel microperferation), and diarrhea (possible C. Diff).  Continue
   current level of care, and empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL CYSTS/MASS --  would require further imaging (Abd/pelvic CT).
   Urology and IR recommend further imating prior to considering
   percutaneous drainage.
   BACTEREMIA -- Enterococcus, and 2 GNRs (awaiting identification).
   Possible urinary source, but consider GI source.  Continue
   antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cipro, and consider emipirical Flagyl PO.
   HYPERTENSION
  Receiving atenolol and lisinopril prior to admission,
   now intermittently using iv hydralazine.  Restart low-dose captopril
   (creatinine improved).  Goal BP= 150-170 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Narrow complex, intermittently irregular rhythm.
   Anxiety.  Monitor.  Use b-blocker.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely pre-renal and ATN, now rapidly improving.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Volume resussitation.  Monitor Na+, provide free H2O
   --> replete iv if inadequate POs.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO.  Provide suppliments.
   HEMATURIA -- Resoved.  Markedly elvated PSA
 Hematuria resolved, off
   of CBI.  Will discuss with urology about follow-up of PSA
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 continue synthroid
   DEMENTIA
 Extent of dementia unclear, may be siginificant component of
   deafness limiting communications.  On donepizil and risperidone.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a septic shock patient with several potential medical complications. The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia. The lab results indicate renal failure, hypernatremia, and an elevated PSA level. The physical examination reveals right lower extremity edema and muscle wasting.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition are as follows:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already experiencing septic shock, which indicates a severe infection spreading throughout the body.
2. Renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating impaired kidney function.
3. Hypernatremia: The high sodium levels suggest dehydration or imbalances in electrolytes.
4. Elevated PSA level: The markedly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level may indicate a prostate issue or prostate cancer.
5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains high despite medication adjustments.
6. Tachycardia: The elevated heart rate could be a result of sepsis, hypotension, or anxiety.
7. Possible urinary source of infection: The presence of Proteus in the urine suggests a urinary tract infection.
8. GI source of infection: The polymicrobial sepsis and diarrhea may point to a gastrointestinal source, possibly bowel perforation or Clostridium difficile infection.
9. Renal cysts or masses: The patient has renal cysts or masses that require further imaging.
10. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with Enterococcus and two Gram-negative rods (awaiting identification).
11. Acute kidney injury (ATN): The patient is likely experiencing acute tubular necrosis, which is rapidly improving.
12. Hypothyroidism: The patient has hypothyroidism, which requires ongoing management.
13. Dementia: The patient's extent of dementia is unclear but may be a significant component of deafness limiting communication.

These potential medical complications need to be closely monitored and managed to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient."

","The patient is a 53-year-old male admitted to the ICU with sepsis. He has been experiencing persistent hypertension, diarrhea, and intermittent agitation. The patient has a history of renal cysts, bacteremia with Enterococcus and two Gram-negative rods (awaiting identification), hypertension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, nutritional support, hematuria, hypothyroidism, and dementia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8Â°C (98.3Â°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 192/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antihypertensives, and other ICU medications.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets. Blood cultures have grown Gram-negative rods and Gram-positive cocci. Renal function tests indicate acute renal failure. Other lab values reveal elevated glucose levels, elevated troponin-T, and abnormal liver function tests.

Assessment and plan include septic shock, renal cysts/ masses, bacteremia, hypertension, tachycardia, acute renal failure, hypernatremia, nutritional support, hematuria, hypothyroidism, and dementia. The patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotics, antihypertensive therapy, and other necessary ICU care.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with multiple health issues including SIRS/sepsis of likely pulmonary or urinary source, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria. The patient's blood pressure has been difficult to control, with readings ranging from 150s-170s. The patient has also experienced tachycardia, which has improved with increased beta-blockade. 

The patient's electrolytes are somewhat imbalanced, with high sodium levels and low potassium levels. His renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels and the presence of ARF. The patient's urinalysis shows hematuria.

The patient is currently on several medications, including captopril, metoprolol, nifedipine, ampicillin, heparin sodium, and others. He has undergone multiple cultures and tests to identify the source of infection and determine appropriate antibiotic therapy.

The patient's vitals are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 175/95 to 202/110 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%.

In terms of potential medical complications, the patient is at risk for further infections due to his immunocompromised state from sepsis. His high blood pressure may require ongoing management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure. The patient's"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 90-year-old male with multiple medical conditions and complications. 

Summary of the note:
- The patient has been diagnosed with SIRS/sepsis, likely of pulmonary or urinary origin, acute renal failure (ARF), and hematuria.
- His blood cultures have grown Proteus and Enterococcus, both of which are being treated with ampicillin.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with medications including metoprolol and captopril.
- He is also on nifedipine for blood pressure control.
- Tachycardia has been improved with increased beta-blockade.
- ARF was present upon discharge from a previous hospital stay and may have been caused by hypotension or another underlying cause.
- The patient is currently resolving with massive autodiuresis, likely post-ATN diuresis.
- Hematuria is suspected to be traumatic due to Foley catheter replacement.
- Hypernatremia is suspected to be caused by massive low solute auto-diuresis, and the patient is encouraged to drink PO water.
- A syncopal event occurred, but the EKG showed no concerning acute event.
- Elevated troponin levels are present in the setting of ARF.
- The patient has a history of gastric ulcer, which is positive for H. pylori.
- He also has lung nodules, hypothyroidism, dementia, and other chronic conditions"

   Assessment and Plan
   SEPTIC SHOCK
  Resolved, GNRs and GPCs bacteremia, Proteus in urine.
   Attributed to urinary source, although polymicrobial sepsis suggests
   potetial GI source (bowel microperferation), and diarrhea (possible C.
   Diff).  Continue current level of care, and empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL CYSTS/MASS --  would require further imaging (Abd/pelvic CT).
   Urology and IR recommend further imating prior to considering
   percutaneous drainage.
   BACTEREMIA -- Enterococcus, and 2 GNRs (awaiting identification).
   Possible urinary source, but consider GI source.  Continue
   antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cipro, and consider emipirical Flagyl PO.
   HYPERTENSION
  Receiving atenolol and lisinopril prior to admission.
   Now on captopril (creatinine improved) and nifedipine with improved
   control.  Goal BP= 150-170 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Narrow complex, intermittently irregular rhythm.
   Anxiety.  Monitor.  Use b-blocker.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely pre-renal and ATN, now rapidly improving.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Volume resussitation.  Monitor Na+, provide free H2O
   --> replete iv if inadequate POs.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO.  Provide suppliments.
   HEMATURIA -- Resoved.  Markedly elvated PSA
 Hematuria resolved, off
   of CBI.  Will discuss with urology about follow-up of PSA
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 continue synthroid.
   DEMENTIA
 Extent of dementia unclear, may be siginificant component of
   deafness limiting communications.  On donepizil and risperidone.
   CAD --  troponin leak in setting of hypotension (demand), now
   declining.

   Assessment and Plan
   SEPTIC SHOCK
  Resolved, GNRs and GPCs bacteremia, Proteus in urine.
   Attributed to urinary source, although polymicrobial sepsis suggests
   potetial GI source (bowel microperferation), and diarrhea (possible C.
   Diff).  Continue current level of care, and empirical antimicrobials.
   RENAL CYSTS/MASS --  would require further imaging (Abd/pelvic CT).
   Urology and IR recommend further imating prior to considering
   percutaneous drainage.
   BACTEREMIA -- Enterococcus, and 2 GNRs (awaiting identification).
   Possible urinary source, but consider GI source.  Continue
   antimicrobials --> Vanco, Cipro, and consider emipirical Flagyl PO.
   HYPERTENSION
  Receiving atenolol and lisinopril prior to admission.
   Now on captopril (creatinine improved) and nifedipine with improved
   control.  Goal BP= 150-170 mmHg.
   TACHYCARDIA -- Narrow complex, intermittently irregular rhythm.
   Anxiety.  Monitor.  Use b-blocker.
   RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE
 Likely pre-renal and ATN, now rapidly improving.
   HYPERNATREMIA -- Volume resussitation.  Monitor Na+, provide free H2O
   --> replete iv if inadequate POs.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- PO.  Provide suppliments.
   HEMATURIA -- Resoved.  Markedly elvated PSA
 Hematuria resolved, off
   of CBI.  Will discuss with urology about follow-up of PSA
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 continue synthroid.
   DEMENTIA
 Extent of dementia unclear, may be siginificant component of
   deafness limiting communications.  On donepizil and risperidone.
   CAD --  troponin leak in setting of hypotension (demand), now
   declining.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have sepsis and hypertension, which are currently being managed with antibiotics and antihypertensive medications. The patient also has renal failure, possibly due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and hypernatremia. They are receiving nutritional support through oral intake. The patient's hematuria has resolved, but they have a markedly elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, indicating a potential underlying issue with the prostate. The patient is also being treated for hypothyroidism, dementia, and coronary artery disease (CAD). 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction or failure if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypertension may progress to end-organ damage if blood pressure is not adequately controlled.
3. Renal failure may worsen if renal function is not supported and the underlying cause is not addressed.
4. Hypernatremia may result in neurological complications if electrolyte imbalances are not corrected.
5. The elevated PSA level suggests a possible prostate pathology, which could progress to more severe conditions like prostate cancer if not investigated further.
6. Dementia and CAD are chronic conditions that require ongoing management to prevent further deterioration.
7. The patient's critical illness increases the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which need to be monitored and prevented through appropriate interventions."
