   65W admitted with altered mental status and worsening back pain. First
   got sick 1 week ago and was seen for her back pain. Given pain meds and
   tamiflu for myalgias and fevers. Became more somnolent over past [**12-26**]
   days, taking in less and less PO's. Brought in to ER last night - WBC
   20, creatinine > 5, afebrile. Rash noted. She was given 4 antibiotics
   and IVF.
   Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] - vitals stable though somnolent and confused. Rash
   again noted. Head CT unremarkable. Spinal MRI - multiple epidural
   collections. Ortho felt no surgical intervention needed.
   Multiple lab abnormalities including lactic acidosis, renal failure and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female who was admitted with altered mental status and worsening back pain. She initially received pain medication and tamiflu for myalgias and fevers but became more somnolent over the past 12-26 days, taking in less and less PO's. The patient was brought to the ER last night with WBC 20, creatinine > 5, afebrile, and a rash noted. She was given 4 antibiotics and IVF.

The patient was then transferred to Hospital1 with stable vitals though somnolent and confused, with a rash again noted. A head CT was unremarkable, but a spinal MRI revealed multiple epidural collections. Ortho felt no surgical intervention needed.

Multiple lab abnormalities were observed, including lactic acidosis, renal failure, and abnormal LFTs with thrombocytopenia. The patient received further antibiotics.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was on 10/15/2187 at 09:42 PM (Ampicillin), 10:16 PM (Ceftriaxone), and 11:15 PM (Doxycycline).

The patient is currently in the ICU with the following vital signs: Tcurrent: 36.5°C (97.7°F), HR: 94 bpm, BP: 103/52 mmHg, RR: 14 insp/min, and SpO2: 93%. She is on broad spectrum antibiotics for what appears to be a disseminated infection, more compatible with bacterial infection. An echo will be obtained in the AM, along with repeat head imaging. Renal failure is improving with IVF, acidosis gap and lactic acid are improving with continued volume resuscitation, elevated LFTs will be followed, and thrombocytopenia is likely related to infection, with no evidence of DIC.

The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition (npo), glycemic control, lines (22 Gauge and 20 Gauge), prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old who was admitted with altered mental status and worsening back pain. They initially sought medical attention one week ago for back pain and were given pain medication and tamiflu for myalgias and fevers. Over the past 12-26 days, the patient became more somnolent, taking in less and less oral intake. They were brought to the emergency room last night with a white blood cell count of 20, creatinine level higher than 5, and no fever. A rash was noted, and the patient was given four different antibiotics and intravenous fluids.

The patient was then transferred to another hospital with stable vital signs but remained somnolent and confused. A rash was again observed, and a head CT showed no abnormalities. A spinal MRI revealed multiple epidural collections, and orthopedic surgeons decided against surgical intervention. The patient also experienced multiple lab abnormalities including lactic acidosis, renal failure, abnormal liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. They received further antibiotics.

The patient is unable to provide their medical history due to encephalopathy. They have no known drug allergies and received three doses of antibiotics between October 15th, 2018, at 9:42 PM, 10:16 PM, and 11:15 PM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C, heart rate of 94 bpm, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. The patient is on nasal cannula oxygen and has sinus rhythm.

The physical examination reveals that the patient appears thin, has signs of likely meningismus and peri-auricular rash, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and tender abdomen, no lower extremity edema, and unresponsiveness neurologically.

The patient's laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 11.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 10.9 K/uL, platelet count of 57 K/uL, creatinine level of 4.9 mg/dL, glucose level of 169 mg/dL, and other lab abnormalities such as elevated liver enzymes, abnormal electrolyte levels, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient also has a lactic acid level of 2.4 mmol/L.

The patient's imaging results include a spinal MRI showing multifocal small collections that could be epidural abscesses or hematomas, an unremarkable chest X-ray, and abdominal CT with small effusions. The head CT is normal.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with encephalopathy, epidural abscesses, meningismus, and rash. The presentation is compatible with an epidural abscess with meningoencephalitis. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for a disseminated infection that appears to be bacterial in nature. No supporting evidence for cancer or vasculitis is present. The plan is to await microbiological evaluation and continue antibiotics. An echocardiogram will be obtained in the morning, and repeat head imaging will also be done.

The patient is also being treated for renal failure, acidosis, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia."

She was brought to the ER, where she was found to have a WBC count of 20, elevated creatinine levels, a rash, and was started on four different antibiotics. She was then transferred to Hospital1, where her vital signs remained stable, but she remained somnolent and confused. A spinal MRI revealed multiple epidural collections, and orthopedics determined that no surgical intervention was necessary.

The patient has multiple lab abnormalities including lactic acidosis, renal failure, abnormal liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. She received further antibiotics and other ICU medications. The patient's psychiatric/sleep review indicates delirium.

The flow sheet data shows that her temperature is within normal range, heart rate is slightly elevated, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is normal, and oxygen saturation is 93%. She is receiving IV fluids and has been transfused with blood products. Her urine output is 240 mL, and she has a positive fluid balance. She is on nasal cannula oxygen and her ABG results are pending.

Physical examination findings suggest meningismus, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen, and no lower extremity ed"

She presented with fevers and worsening back pain, as well as decreased oral intake and altered mental status. She was admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but her condition continued to deteriorate. She was found to have multiple diffuse epidural collections, mostly in the thoracic spine, and one each in the cervical and lumbar spine. The patient also has acute renal failure, as indicated by an elevated creatinine level of 5.7 mg/dL and a decrease in urine output.

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: her multiple abscesses are most worrisome for
   bacterial seeding of her spine.  It seems unlikely that she would have
   multiple hemorrhages as she has not had recent trauma and is not
   severely thrombocytopenic.  It does not have the appearance of
   metastasis.  Most likely bacteria are staph aureus and strep species
   from a skin infection, dental abscess or endocarditis.  Urine culture
   with staph aureus is likely source.   Also concerning for meningitis
   with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vanco (already received 2 doses in setting of renal failure),
   ampicillin 2g Q12 (given age), acyclovir 600mg daily, and doxycycline.
   - TEE for endocarditis because more sensitive
   - ID recommends vancomycin
   .
   #. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is
   concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to her brain.  She does
   not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam though she is not
   cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for infection.  Her
   MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.
   - continue to treat infection.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting prerenal, but a FeNa of
   1.4 sugesting ATN.  There could be a component of pyelonephritis or,
   given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no
   evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - aggressive rehydration with LR at 250cc/hr
   - trend creatinine.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up.
   - renal following and recommended urine lytes at this time.
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base.  Most likely
   related to an infectious process.  Less likely vasculitis or drug
   reaction.  Appear to small to allow for gram stain or DFA of vesicles.
   - treat infection as above.
   - dermatology consulted and did swab of one of the pustules; will make
   further recs in the am including bx recs.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Less likely
   viral infection or autoimmune.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended,
   but no other significant findings.  Are increased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia was
   concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear, and no acutely worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor
   production in the setting of infection, though this would suggest a
   sub-acute infection like endocarditis or a primary abscess.  Are
   increasingly low.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure like LP.
   - appreciate heme-onc help with suggestions
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is now 94%
   on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2.  Does not have picture suggestive for
   PE.  Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Patient has an anion gap acidosis that is closing
   with hydration.
   - aggressive rehydration as above.
   - need a repeat ABG today to assess status of this.
   .
   FEN: LR at 250cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO for now
   Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin?

   Code:  Full (discussed with husband)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, presenting with back pain and altered mental status. She has multiple small epidural collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient underwent several tests including a transesophageal echo, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture. Allergies to medications were not reported.

24-hour events included the administration of various antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir. The patient's vital signs were monitored, showing a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/58 mmHg to 145/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight was 60 kg, with a total fluid intake of 9,262 mL and output of 3,550 mL.

Physical examination findings included sinus tachycardia, altered mental status, and no focal neurological deficits. Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased creatinine, and thrombocytopenia. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed elevated white blood cell count and RBCs, but no organisms seen on Gram stain. Imaging studies showed progression of left"

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Her multiple abscesses are most worrisome for
   bacterial seeding of her spine.  It seems unlikely that she would have
   multiple hemorrhages as she has not had recent trauma and is not
   severely thrombocytopenic.  It also does not have the appearance of
   metastasis.  Most likely bacteria are staph aureus and strep species
   from a skin infection, dental abscess or endocarditis.  Urine culture
   with staph aureus is likely source.  Also concerning for meningitis
   with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vanco (already received 2 doses in setting of renal failure),
   ampicillin 2g Q12 (given age), acyclovir 600mg daily.
   - can increase vanco to q24 and acyclovir to q12 given improving renal
   function
   - discontinue doxycycline
   - ID strongly recommends vancomycin; consider tailoring down antibiotic
   regimen soon
   - No TEE for now, as [**Male First Name (un) **]
t feel it would change management per se
   .
   #. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is
   concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to her brain.  She does
   not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam though she is not
   cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for infection.  Her
   MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.
   - continue to treat infection.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting prerenal, but a FeNa of
   1.4 sugesting ATN.  There could be a component of pyelonephritis or,
   given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no
   evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - had been aggressively rehydrating with LR
 discontinued this AM; can
   restart NS w/ goal of 100cc UOP/ hour d/t acyclovir
   - trend creatinine.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up
   - renal following and recommended urine lytes at this time
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base.  Most likely
   related to an infectious process. Less likely vasculitis or drug
   reaction.  Appear too small to allow for gram stain or DFA of vesicles.
   Dermatology was consulted
 they did swab of one of the pustules (PMN
   and strep in chains).
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - consider derm biopsy today; touch base with ID regarding role for
   biopsy
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Less likely
   viral infection or autoimmune.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended,
   but no other significant findings.  Transaminitis is increased this
   morning.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia was
   concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC (continue to keep
   these in the differential).  No schistocytes on smear, and no acutely
   worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor production in the setting of
   infection, though this would suggest a sub-acute infection like
   endocarditis or a primary abscess. Platelets decreased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   - appreciate Heme-Onc suggestions/rec
   -repeat DIC w/u : fibrinogen/haptoglobin/smear/coags
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is now 94%
   on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2.  Does not have picture suggestive for
   PE.  Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Patient has an anion gap acidosis that is closing
   with hydration.
   - aggressive rehydration as above
   - repeat ABG today to re-assess
   .
   FEN: NS at 100cc/hour, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, try to keep
   urine output 100cc/hour given ARF and on nephrotoxins (like acyclovir).
   Prophylaxis: Hold subcutaneous heparin, given worsening
   thrombocytopenia. Pneumoboots.

","The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, presenting with back pain and altered mental status. She has multiple small epidural collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 139/58 mmHg to 145/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula.

Physical examination reveals a lethargic patient with decreased breath sounds on the right side, no murmurs on cardiovascular examination, non-distended abdomen with soft bowel sounds present, and no edema or distal pulses present on extremities. The patient has skin findings of pustules with purpuric bases on her back and ankle. Neurological examination shows the patient oriented to voice but not command.

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), low platelet count, and electrolyte imbalances. Imaging studies show progression of left-sided atypical parenchymal infiltrates and appearance of new small patchy infiltrates on the right lung base.

","The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with chronic back pain, altered mental status, and multiple small epidural collections. He also has acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient underwent several diagnostic tests including trans esophageal echo, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), lumbar puncture, and blood cultures.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), increased creatinine levels, and elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis reveals elevated WBC and RBC counts, but no organisms seen on gram stain. The urine culture shows the presence of Staphylococcus aureus. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is nonreactive, indicating no syphilis infection.

The patient's imaging studies include a chest X-ray showing left-sided atypical parenchymal infiltrates with new small patchy infiltrates on the right lung base. The MRI head reveals no evidence of acute intracranial process, hemorrhage, or diffusion abnormalities. The abdominal ultrasound shows a distended gallbladder without specific signs of cholecystitis. The echocardiogram indicates mild pulmonary hypertension and no vegetations or clinically-significant regurgitant valvular disease seen.

   Assessment and Plan
   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: her multiple abscesses are most worrisome for
   bacterial seeding of her spine.  It seems unlikely that she would have
   multiple hemorrhages as she has not had recent trauma and is not
   severely thrombocytopenic.  It does not have the appearance of
   metastasis.  Most likely bacteria are staph aureus and strep species
   from a skin infection, dental abscess or endocarditis.  Urine culture
   with staph aureus is likely source.   Also concerning for meningitis
   with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vanco (already received 2 doses in setting of renal failure),
   ampicillin 2g Q12 (given age), acyclovir 600mg daily, and doxycycline.
   - TEE for endocarditis because more sensitive
   - ID recommends vancomycin
   .
   #. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is
   concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to her brain.  She does
   not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam though she is not
   cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for infection.  Her
   MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.
   - continue to treat infection.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting prerenal, but a FeNa of
   1.4 sugesting ATN.  There could be a component of pyelonephritis or,
   given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no
   evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - aggressive rehydration with LR at 250cc/hr
   - trend creatinine.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up.
   - renal following and recommended urine lytes at this time.
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base.  Most likely
   related to an infectious process.  Less likely vasculitis or drug
   reaction.  Appear to small to allow for gram stain or DFA of vesicles.
   - treat infection as above.
   - dermatology consulted and did swab of one of the pustules; will make
   further recs in the am including bx recs.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Less likely
   viral infection or autoimmune.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended,
   but no other sig findings.  Are increased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia was
   concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC.  No schistocytes on
   smear, and no acutely worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor
   production in the setting of infection, though this would suggest a
   sub-acute infection like endocarditis or a primary abscess.  Are
   increasingly low.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure like LP.
   - appreciate heme-onc help with suggestions
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is now 94%
   on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2.  Does not have picture suggestive for
   PE.  Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider lasix.
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Patient has an anion gap acidosis that is closing
   with hydration.
   - aggressive rehydration as above.
   - need a repeat ABG today to assess status of this.
   .
   FEN: LR at 250cc/hr, replete electrolytes, NPO for now

   Disposition: pending clinical improvement
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient. These include:

1. Septicemia: The patient has multiple epidural abscesses, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. These findings suggest a possible bacterial infection, which could lead to septicemia.

2. Meningitis: The patient's altered mental status, along with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing an increased white blood cell count, is concerning for meningitis. Broad coverage for possible meningitis has been initiated with ceftriaxone.

3. Endocarditis: The patient's clinical presentation, including fever and skin rash, raises concern for endocarditis. Although the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) did not reveal any vegetations, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) has been ordered due to its higher sensitivity for detecting endocarditis.

4. Acute renal failure: The patient is showing signs of both prerenal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) components of renal failure. This may be due to dehydration, infection, or possibly vasculitis. Aggressive rehydration and close monitoring of renal function are recommended.

5. Rash: The tiny pustules with purpuric bases are likely related to an infectious process. Further evaluation, including dermatology consultation and swabbing of the p"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman admitted with lower back pain, altered mental status, and fevers. She has been diagnosed with meningitis and is currently in the ICU. The patient underwent several diagnostic tests including a transesophageal echo, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture. She is receiving multiple antibiotics and antiviral medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which can be a sign of delirium. Delirium is a medical emergency and requires prompt evaluation and management.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, indicated by elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output. This can be a complication of severe infection or sepsis.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient has low oxygen levels in her blood. This may be due to respiratory issues or poor oxygen delivery to the tissues.
4. Pustular Skin Rash: The presence of a pustular rash could indicate a disseminated staphylococcus aureus infection. This is a concerning finding that needs to be addressed promptly.
5. Meningitis: The patient has been diagnosed with meningitis, which is an infection of the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This condition requires aggressive treatment with appropriate antibiotics.
6. Epidural Abscess: Although not confirmed, the possibility of an epidural abscess should be considered given the patient's symptoms and risk"

   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Her multiple abscesses are most worrisome for
   bacterial seeding of her spine.  It seems unlikely that she would have
   multiple hemorrhages as she has not had recent trauma and is not
   severely thrombocytopenic.  It also does not have the appearance of
   metastasis.  Most likely bacteria are staph aureus and strep species
   from a skin infection, dental abscess or endocarditis.  Urine culture
   with staph aureus is likely source.  Also concerning for meningitis
   with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vancomycin, ampicillin 2g Q6 (given age), acyclovir 600mg IV q12.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is
   concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to her brain.  She does
   not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam though she is not
   cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for infection.  Her
   MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.
   - continue to treat infection.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting prerenal, but a FeNa of
   1.4 sugesting ATN.  There could be a component of pyelonephritis or,
   given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no
   evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - had been aggressively rehydrating with LR
 discontinued this AM; can
   restart NS w/ goal of 100cc UOP/ hour d/t acyclovir
   - trend creatinine.
   - f/u urine culture.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up
   - renal following and recommended urine lytes at this time
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base.  Most likely
   related to an infectious process. Less likely vasculitis or drug
   reaction.  Appear too small to allow for gram stain or DFA of vesicles.
   Dermatology was consulted
 they did swab of one of the pustules (PMN
   and strep in chains).
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - consider derm biopsy today; touch base with ID regarding role for
   biopsy
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Less likely
   viral infection or autoimmune.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended,
   but no other significant findings.  Transaminitis is increased this
   morning.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia was
   concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC (continue to keep
   these in the differential).  No schistocytes on smear, and no acutely
   worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor production in the setting of
   infection, though this would suggest a sub-acute infection like
   endocarditis or a primary abscess. Platelets decreased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   - appreciate Heme-Onc suggestions/rec
   - repeat DIC w/u: fibrinogen/haptoglobin/smear/coags
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is now 94%
   on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2.  Does not have picture suggestive for
   PE.  Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider administration of lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Patient has an anion gap acidosis that is closing
   with hydration.
   - aggressive rehydration as above
   - repeat ABG today to re-assess
   .
   FEN: NS at 100cc/hour, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, try to keep
   urine output 100cc/hour given ARF and on nephrotoxins (like acyclovir).
   Prophylaxis: Hold subcutaneous heparin, given worsening
   thrombocytopenia. Pneumoboots.

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient's chief complaint is staph sepsis. The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and altered mental status. The patient was found to have multiple, small epidural collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Epidural abscesses: The multiple abscesses in the patient's spine are worrisome for bacterial seeding. The most likely bacteria causing the infection are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species, which may have originated from a skin infection, dental abscess, or endocarditis. There is also concern for meningitis with local spread. An MRI of the head did not reveal any significant findings, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) found no endocarditis. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover possible meningitis.

2. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to the brain. Although there are no focal deficits on the neurologic exam, the patient is not cooperative. A lumbar puncture was performed, showing cell counts concerning for infection. The patient's MR head did not reveal any masses, etc. The patient is being treated with antibiotics and electrolyte repletion as needed.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient appears to have a component of pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is improvement with intravenous fluid suggesting pre-renal, but a fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) of 1.4 suggesting ATN. There could be a component of pyelonephritis or, given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis on the CT scan. The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and appropriate measures are being taken to manage the acute renal failure.

4. Rash: The patient has a rash that appears as tiny pustules with a purpuric base. This is most likely related to an infectious process. The patient's dermatology consult has been consulted, and a swab of one of the pustules was taken for further testing.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which are most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of dehydration or biliary sludging in the setting of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The patient's RUQ showed a distended gallbladder, but no other significant findings. Transaminitis is being closely monitored, and appropriate measures are being taken.

6. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count is concerning for a consumptive process like thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (T"

 RASH
   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Bacteremia: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.  It
   does not have the appearance of metastasis.  Unclear what the source
   is.  Most likely secondary seeding of urine and skin.  Also concerning
   for meningitis with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found
   no endocarditis.  There is some concern for a second organism
   considering she continued to spike fevers through yesterday.  Though
   her clinical picture is improving, we will continue with the current
   antibiotics until she is afebrile, then we will consider changing over
   to nafcillin for an expected 6 week course.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vancomycin, ampicillin 2g Q6 (given age), acyclovir 600mg IV q12.
   - discuss possibly narrowing antibiotics with ID.
   - discuss whether the results of a TEE would alter her course of
   antibiotics, or if we will be treating for 6 weeks either way.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Mental status is dramatically improved
   today.  She does not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam
   though she is not cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for
   infection.  Her MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.  Neurology was
   consulted yesterday and recommended a MRI w/ contrast when we are able.
   - continue to treat infection as above.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   While she has improved dramatically, her FeNa of 1.4 suggested ATN.
   There could be a component of pyelonephritis or, given her rash,
   vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no evidence of
   hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - Today will give free water at 100cc/hr for her hypernatremia
   - trend creatinine.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base that grew out
   staph aureus on culture.  Most likely related to an infectious process.
   Less likely vasculitis or drug reaction.  More concerning are the
   necrotic patches that she developed on her back and ankle which could
   be a fungal process.  Two skin biopsies were done yesterday.
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - f/u biopsy results.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Currently
   improving.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended, but no other
   significant findings.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: Improved this morning, suggesting that she could
   have improving production No schistocytes on smear, and no acutely
   worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor production in the setting of
   infection, though this would suggest a sub-acute infection like
   endocarditis or a primary abscess. Platelets decreased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is then
   developed O2 requirement.  Does not have picture suggestive for PE.
   Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider administration of lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   FEN: D5W at 100cc/hour, replete electrolytes, NPO until she is more
   awake.
   Prophylaxis: Hold subcutaneous heparin, given thrombocytopenia.

","The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, presenting with fever, altered mental status, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with bacteremia, likely due to Staphylococcus aureus, and there is concern for meningitis with local spread. The patient's condition is improving, but she continues to spike fevers. The patient's altered mental status has dramatically improved today. 

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Severe sepsis or septic shock: The patient's fever, altered mental status, and acute renal failure suggest an ongoing infection, which can lead to severe sepsis or septic shock if not appropriately managed.
2. Meningitis: The patient's symptoms, including fever and altered mental status, raise concern for meningitis. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and prevent complications.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, indicating AKI. Prompt management is crucial to prevent further deterioration and potential long-term renal damage.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required to prevent bleeding events.
5. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation has decreased, indicating possible respiratory involvement. Continued monitoring and intervention are necessary to ensure adequate oxygenation.
6. Infectious complications: Given"

   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Epidural abscesses: Her multiple abscesses are most worrisome for
   bacterial seeding of her spine.  It seems unlikely that she would have
   multiple hemorrhages as she has not had recent trauma and is not
   severely thrombocytopenic.  It also does not have the appearance of
   metastasis.  Most likely bacteria are staph aureus and strep species
   from a skin infection, dental abscess or endocarditis.  Urine culture
   with staph aureus is likely source.  Also concerning for meningitis
   with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis.
   - Cover broadly for possible meningitis with ceftriaxone 2gm IV Q12,
   vanco (already received 2 doses in setting of renal failure),
   ampicillin 2g Q12 (given age), acyclovir 600mg daily.
   - can increase vanco to q24 and acyclovir to q12 given improving renal
   function
   - discontinue doxycycline
   - ID strongly recommends vancomycin; consider tailoring down antibiotic
   regimen soon
   - No TEE for now, as [**Male First Name (un) **]
t feel it would change management per se
   .
   #. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is
   concerning for encephalitis or bacterial emboli to her brain.  She does
   not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam though she is not
   cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for infection.  Her
   MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.
   - continue to treat infection.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting prerenal, but a FeNa of
   1.4 sugesting ATN.  There could be a component of pyelonephritis or,
   given her rash, vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no
   evidence of hydronephrosis on CT scan.

   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base.  Most likely
   related to an infectious process. Less likely vasculitis or drug
   reaction.  Appear too small to allow for gram stain or DFA of vesicles.
   Dermatology was consulted
 they did swab of one of the pustules (PMN
   and strep in chains).
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - consider derm biopsy today; touch base with ID regarding role for
   biopsy
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Less likely
   viral infection or autoimmune.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended,
   but no other significant findings.  Transaminitis is increased this
   morning.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: in combination with direct bilirubinemia was
   concerning for consumptive process like TTP or DIC (continue to keep
   these in the differential).  No schistocytes on smear, and no acutely
   worsening anemia.  Most likely due to poor production in the setting of
   infection, though this would suggest a sub-acute infection like
   endocarditis or a primary abscess. Platelets decreased this morning.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   - appreciate Heme-Onc suggestions/rec
   -repeat DIC w/u : fibrinogen/haptoglobin/smear/coags

   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is now 94%
   on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2.  Does not have picture suggestive for
   PE.  Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   # Anion gap acidosis: Patient has an anion gap acidosis that is closing
   with hydration.
   - aggressive rehydration as above
   - repeat ABG today to re-assess
   .
   FEN: NS at 100cc/hour, replete electrolytes, NPO for now, try to keep

   Disposition: Pending clinical improvement
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Infection: The patient has a history of chronic back pain and altered mental status, along with multiple epidural collections. This raises concern for possible meningitis or bacterial seeding of the spine. The urine culture with Staphylococcus aureus is likely the source of infection. Broad coverage for possible meningitis is recommended.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient appears to have a component of pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is improvement with IV fluid suggesting pre-renal, but a Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FeNa) of 1.4 suggesting ATN. This could be due to pyelonephritis or vasculitis, although these seem less likely. Aggressive rehydration and close monitoring of renal function are advised.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation has decreased from 98% on room air to 94% on a shovel mask with 50% FiO2. This could be due to infectious involvement of the lung seen on the chest X-ray. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a decreased platelet count, which may be due to poor production in the setting of infection. There is no evidence of schistocytes on smear, suggesting that TTP or DIC are less likely. Monitoring platelet levels and considering"

   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and

   .
   #. Bacteremia: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.  It
   does not have the appearance of metastasis.  Unclear what the source
   is.  Most likely secondary seeding of urine and skin.  Also concerning
   for meningitis with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found
   no endocarditis.  There is some concern for a second organism
   considering she continued to spike fevers through yesterday.  Though
   her clinical picture is improving, we will continue with the current
   antibiotics until she is afebrile, then we will consider changing over
   to nafcillin for an expected 6 week course.
   - narrow antibiotics to just nafcillin.
   - repeat spinal MRI w/ or w/o (as needed) to reassess spinal abscesses
   per spine service.
   - discuss whether the results of a TEE would alter her course of
   antibiotics, or if we will be treating for 6 weeks either way.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Mental status is dramatically improved
   today.  She does not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam
   though she is not cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for
   infection.  Her MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.  Neurology was
   consulted yesterday and recommended a MRI w/ contrast when we are able.
   - continue to treat infection as above.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   - f/u neurology recs
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   While she has improved dramatically, her FeNa of 1.4 suggested ATN.
   There could be a component of pyelonephritis or, given her rash,
   vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no evidence of
   hydronephrosis on CT scan.
   - Today will give free water at 100cc/hr for her hypernatremia
   - trend creatinine.
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base that grew out
   staph aureus on culture.  Most likely related to an infectious process.
   Less likely vasculitis or drug reaction.  More concerning are the
   necrotic patches that she developed on her back and ankle which could
   be a fungal process.  Two skin biopsies were done yesterday.
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - f/u biopsy results.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Currently
   improving.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended, but no other
   significant findings.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: continues to improve, suggesting that she could
   have improving production.  No signs at any point of TTP.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is then
   developed O2 requirement.  Does not have picture suggestive for PE.
   Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider administration of lasix
   - continue to treat infection
   .
   FEN: D5W at 100cc/hour, replete electrolytes, NPO until she is more
   awake.
   Prophylaxis: Hold subcutaneous heparin, given thrombocytopenia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of MSSA bacteremia. She has a history of chronic back pain and was found to have multiple, small epidural collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia. The patient is currently being treated with antibiotics for suspected staphylococcus aureus infection. Her fever has improved, but she still has altered mental status, hypoxemia, renal failure, rash, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be due to various causes, including infection, electrolyte imbalances, or other underlying conditions. Monitoring and addressing these issues are crucial.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure with both pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis components. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are necessary.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which may be due to respiratory involvement in the infection. Oxygen therapy and further evaluation of the respiratory system are important.
5. Rash: The patient has a rash that may be related to the infection or another underlying condition. Skin biopsies have been done for further evaluation.
6. Transaminitis:"

   .
   #. Bacteremia: Had staph aureus seeding of her spine, skin and
   kidneys.  Unclear what the initial source is for seeding the blood.
   Meningitis from other source appearing increasingly unlikely.  Head MRI
   unrevealing and TTE found no endocarditis.  There was some concern for
   a second as she has continued to have low-grade temps, though her
   overall clinical picture is improving dramatically.  We will switch
   over to nafcillin for an expected 6 week course.
   - narrow antibiotics to just nafcillin.  Continue acyclovir until HSV
   PCR from spinal fluid is negative.
   - repeat spinal MRI w/contrast to reassess spinal abscesses per spine
   service.
   - at the same time we will do an MR head w/ contrast to assess for
   bacterial seeding of her brain.
   - no TEE for now.

   #. Altered mental status: Mental status is dramatically improved
   today.  She does not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam
   though she is not cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for
   infection.  Her MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.  Neurology was
   consulted yesterday and recommended a MRI w/ contrast when we are able,
   which we will do today.
   - continue to treat infection as above.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of MSSA bacteremia. She has multiple comorbidities including chronic back pain, altered mental status, acute renal failure, rash, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, tachycardia, and hypoxia.

24-hour events include changing antibiotics to nafcillin after obtaining OSH blood cultures, which also showed MSSA. The patient's last doses of antibiotics were ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, vancomycin, ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and ampicillin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 145/75 to 153/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on a nasal cannula. She is alert and oriented x3, more interactive in the morning, tachycardic without murmurs, with CTAB findings on pulmonary examination, soft abdomen, slight upper extremity edema, and extreme weakness in all extremities.

Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 10.9 x 10^9/L, slightly elevated hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, mildly elevated blood urea nitrogen of 212 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine of 4.9 mg/dL. Other lab results show elevated liver enzymes, elevated troponin-T, and low fibrinogen levels.

Imaging reveals improvement of pulmonary edema with possible underlying infection on chest X-ray from October 18th, and no significant findings on chest X-ray from October 19th. Microbiology results show MSSA on skin culture, with blood cultures pending.

Assessment and plan include electrolyte and fluid disorder, fever, hypoxemia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, rash, and other conditions. The patient will continue on nafcillin for an expected 6-week course, along with acyclovir until HSV PCR from spinal fluid is negative. Repeat spinal MRI with contrast and MR head with contrast will be performed to reassess spinal abscesses and assess for bacterial seeding of the brain. No TEE for now. Altered mental status is improving, and the patient will continue to receive treatment for infection, repletion of electrolytes, and follow-up neurology recommendations. Acute renal failure appears to have components of pre-renal and acute tubular necrosis, and the patient will continue to receive free water at 100cc/hr for hypernatremia. Trend creatinine levels, follow-up remaining vasculitis work-up, and renal recommendations. Rash consists of tiny pustules with purpuric base that grew out MSSA on culture, and necrotic patches that could be a fungal process. Follow-up dermatology recommendations and biopsy results. Transaminitis is improving, likely hypoperfusion, and the patient will continue to trend. Thrombocytopenia is improving, suggesting improving production, and the patient will continue to trend, receive platelet transfusion for platelets <10 or <50 in the setting of procedures, and start subcutaneous heparin. Tachycardia is likely due to low-grade fever in the setting of septicemia, and the patient will receive Tylenol for fever and continue antibiotics. Hypoxia is most likely due to infectious involvement of the lung seen on CXR, and the patient will be given lasix if hypoxia worsens, continue to treat infection, and receive pneumoboots."

   65F with history of chronic back pain presenting with back pain and
   altered mental status, found to have multiple, small epidural
   collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia.
   .
   #. Bacteremia: Appears to be staph aureus seeding of her spine.  It
   does not have the appearance of metastasis.  Unclear what the source
   is.  Most likely secondary seeding of urine and skin.  Also concerning
   for meningitis with local spread.  Head MRI unrevealing and TTE found
   no endocarditis.  There is some concern for a second organism
   considering she continued to spike fevers through yesterday.  Though
   her clinical picture is improving, we will continue with the current
   antibiotics until she is afebrile, then we will consider changing over
   to nafcillin for an expected 6 week course.
   - narrow antibiotics to just nafcillin.
   - repeat spinal MRI w/contrast to reassess spinal abscesses per spine
   service.
   - MRI head, per neuro, for AMS
   - discuss whether the results of a TEE would alter her course of
   antibiotics, or if we will be treating for 6 weeks either way.
   .
   #. Altered mental status: Mental status is dramatically improved
   today.  She does not appear to have focal deficits on neurologic exam
   though she is not cooperative.  LP done with cell counts concerning for
   infection.  Her MR head did not reveal any masses, etc.  Neurology was
   consulted yesterday and recommended a MRI w/ contrast when we are able.
   - continue to treat infection as above.
   - replete electrolytes as needed.
   - f/u neurology recs
   - MRI head
   .
   #. Acute renal failure: Appears to have component of prerenal and ATN.
   While she has improved dramatically, her FeNa of 1.4 suggested ATN.
   There could be a component of pyelonephritis or, given her rash,
   vasculitis, though these seem less likely.  There is no evidence of
   hydronephrosis on CT scan. Improved.
   - Today will give free water (D5W) at 100cc/hr for 2L for hypernatremia
   - trend creatinine
   - [**Doctor First Name **], ANCA and vasculitis work-up tests sent and need to be followed
   up
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #. Rash: Appears as tiny pustules with purpuric base that grew out
   staph aureus on culture.  Most likely related to an infectious process.
   Less likely vasculitis or drug reaction.  More concerning are the
   necrotic patches that she developed on her back and ankle which could
   be a fungal process.  Two skin biopsies were done yesterday.
   - treat infection as above
   - f/u derm recs
   - f/u biopsy results.
   .
   #. Transaminitis: most likely from poor perfusion in the setting of
   dehydration, or billiary sludging in the setting of SIRS.  Currently
   improving.  RUQ showed gallbladder was distended, but no other
   significant findings.
   - continue to trend
   - IV hydration
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia: continues to improve, suggesting that she could
   have improving production.  No signs at any point of TTP.
   - continue to trend.
   - transfuse for platelets <10 or <50 in setting of procedure (such as
   LP).
   - ok to start SQ heparin
   .
   # Tachycardia: Likely due to low-grade fever, in setting of septicemia.
   - Tylenol for fever; continue antibiotics
   .
   #. Hypoxia/PNA: Patient was 98% on room air on admission and is then
   developed O2 requirement.  Does not have picture suggestive for PE.
   Most likely d/t infectious involvement of lung seen on CXR.
   - repeat CXR tomorrow.
   - if hypoxia worsens, hold fluids and consider administration of lasix

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of chronic back pain, presenting with back pain and altered mental status. The patient has multiple small epidural collections, acute renal failure, transaminitis, and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this case include:

1. Infection: The patient has MSSA bacteremia and a suspected spinal infection, which could lead to further spread of infection and complications such as sepsis or meningitis.

2. Renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure with a component of prerenal and acute tubular necrosis (ATN). This can result in electrolyte imbalances and the need for dialysis.

3. Delirium/Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to the underlying infection or other factors. It is crucial to monitor and manage this condition to prevent further complications.

4. Skin infection: The patient has a rash with tiny pustules and purpuric base that grew out Staphylococcus aureus on culture. This indicates a possible skin infection, which could progress to more severe complications if left untreated.

5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may be due to sepsis or another underlying condition. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent bleeding complications.

6. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement may be due"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a disseminated staph infection. She is currently improving overall. The patient has been experiencing delirium, and her mental status is altered. She is febrile, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F). Her heart rate is elevated at 103 beats per minute, and her blood pressure is within normal limits. She has a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and her oxygen saturation is 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient has edema in both lower extremities and warm skin. Her neurologic examination reveals that she is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, and is oriented to time three. However, movement, tone, and deep tendon reflexes cannot be assessed.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.9 K/uL, decreased hemoglobin of 10.4 g/dL, elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 169-212 mg/dL, and renal dysfunction indicated by increased creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are also imbalanced, with hypernatremia and hypokalemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Electrolyte and Fluid Disorder: The patient's labs indicate imbalances in sodium and potassium levels, as well as ongoing fluid management issues.
2. Fever: The patient's elevated temperature may indicate an ongoing infection or inflammatory response.
3. Hypox"
