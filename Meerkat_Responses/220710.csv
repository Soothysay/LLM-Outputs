   No growth on blood cultures.
   Assessment and Plan
   55M with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to OSH with variceal bleed, now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for management of recurrent bleeding, EGD
   with active bleeding last night and three bands.  Now stable crit and
   increased WBC count, abnormal CXR
 overall concerning for SBP versus
   PNA. Liver will consult on TIPS and its timing.
   # Upper GI bleed: Demonstrated as secondary to esophageal varices.
   These were sclerosed earlier during his OSH admission and are now
   banded.  His crit is stable, so bleeding appears to be controlled.
   Differential also includes portal hypertensive gastropathy, PUD,
   gastritis, esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **].  Seems to have had two large
   bleeds earlier this admission, with more recent BRBPR followed by
   smaller volume hematemesis today. IR aware.
   - NPO
   - Close airway monitoring; low threshold to intubate.
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt.
   - Cipro for SBP prophylaxis during bleed (has cephalosporin allergy).
   - Keep INR < 1.5, platelets > 50, Hct >30.
   - If acutely decompensating, will need intubation, trauma line or
   cordis, emergent TIPS with IR
   # Ascites
   Less likely blood, more likely ascites. Possible SBP given leukocytosis
   now of 28. Consider albumin and later nutritional supplementation.
   - Diagnostic tap today as decision point for SBP Rx, albumin, etc.
   # PNA and Crackles in bases
   Less likely aspiration given radiographic appearance. Oblique margin
   slightly unusual. Crackles in bases also, suggestive some possible
   fluid overload (even though exam not significant for fluid overload
   otherwise)
   - Continue broad coverage (actually for SBP also)
   - Consider diuresis depending on above w/u and if dyspneic
   - Follow cultures and send sputum and blood cultures
   # Hepatic encephalopathy.  Per OSH report has been encephalopathic
   today (vs. effect of sedating meds); here appears only minimally
   encephalopathic, no asterixis, only short sleep onset latency.
   - Ultrasound and consider diagnostic tap (though treating for SBP right
   now); if positive would need long term prophylaxis and IV albumin on
   day 1 and 3.
   - Consider lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO.
   # ESLD.  Hep C and EtOH as above.  Actively drinking.
   - Consider future diuretics or to help if should become dyspneic.
   - Consider therapeutic tap once stable if large amount of ascites
   present.
   - Management of varices as above.  Consider nadolol if not going to
   TIPS.
   - Consider lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO.
   # Abnormal pulmonary exam.  ?fluid vs. pneumonia vs. atelectasis vs
   aspiration.  Crackles mostly clear with cough.  Did have new O2
   requirement during OSH hospital course.
   - CXR now.
   - Continue O2 therapy.
   # EtOH abuse.
   - thiamine and folate + multi
   - No benzo requirements x 10 days at OSH and aspiration/encephalopathy
   concerns therefore no CIWA
   # Tobacco abuse.
   - Nicotine patch.
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: boots, PPI.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH (ethanol) and HCV (Hepatitis C virus) cirrhosis.
- He was admitted to OSH (Other Hospital) with a variceal bleed and has now been transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU (Medical Intensive Care Unit) for recurrent bleeding.
- The patient underwent an endoscopy with active bleeding last night and three bands were placed to control the bleeding.
- He is currently stable in the ICU with controlled vital signs, but shows signs of sleepiness and has a slightly elevated white blood cell count.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows a possible pneumonia, but it is unclear if it is aspiration or not.
- The patient's abdominal examination reveals some distension and hyperactive bowel sounds, with no rebound tenderness or guarding.
- He has 2+ lower extremity edema and his neurologic examination is intact.
- Laboratory results show anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation profile.
- The patient has a history of EtOH abuse, tobacco abuse, and is actively drinking.
- He is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and pneumonia, as well as other medications to control his bleeding and manage his liver disease.

   55M with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to OSH with variceal bleed, now
   transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for management of recurrent bleeding, ?TIPS
   evaluation.
   # Upper GI bleed.  In cirrhotic patient with known esophageal varices,
   which were sclerosed earlier during his OSH admission.  Differential
   also includes portal hypertensive gastropathy, PUD, gastritis,
   esophagitis, [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **].  Seems to have had two large bleeds earlier
   this admission, with more recent BRBPR followed by smaller volume
   hematemesis today.
   - Liver aware and will EGD today.
   - IR aware (if opens up again and emergent TIPS needed).  Also will be
   available for more elective TIPS if needed later this admit.
   - NPO.
   - Close airway monitoring; low threshold to intubate.
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt.
   - Cipro for SBP prophylaxis during bleed (has cephalosporin allergy).
   - Keep INR < 1.5, platelets > 50, Hct >30.
   - If acutely decompensating, will need intubation, trauma line or
   cordis, emergent TIPS.
   # Ascites
   Less likely blood but not mentioned on CT at admission. Given blood and
   synthetic function reasonable, portal hypertension.  Likely TIPS during
   admission, may consider albumin or nutritional supplementation.
   - Diagnostic tap today
   # PNA
   Less likely aspiration given radiographic appearance. Oblique margin
   slightly unusual.
   - Continue broad coverage (actually for SBP also)
   - Follow cultures and send more sputum
   # Hepatic encephalopathy.  Per OSH report has been encephalopathic
   today (vs. effect of sedating meds); here appears only minimally
   encephalopathic, no asterixis.
   - Ultrasound and consider diagnostic tap (though treating for SBP right
   now); if positive would need long term prophylaxis and IV albumin on
   day 1 and 3.
   - Consider lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO.
   # ESLD.  Hep C and EtOH as above.  Actively drinking.
   - Consider future diuretics.
   - Consider therapeutic tap once stable if large amount of ascites
   present.

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to OSH with variceal bleed,
   transferred back to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for management of recurrent GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Upper vs Lower GI bleed:  In cirrhotic patient with known esophageal
   varices, which were banded on [**11-21**]. Colonoscopy on [**11-21**] at OSH negative
   for source of bleeding. NG lavage last night after transfer to MICU
   positive. Patient with one melanotic stool. Most likely represent upper
   GI source.
   - TIPS today
   - hold nadolol in the setting of acute bleed
   - NPO.
   - Close airway monitoring; low threshold to intubate.
   - PPI gtt.
   - Octreotide gtt.
   - Meropenem for SBP prophylaxis during bleed (has cephalosporin
   allergy).  (Meropenem for broad spectrum coverage for HAP)
   - Keep INR < 1.5, platelets > 50, Hct >30.
   - FFP prior to procedure per IR recommendations.
   - If acutely decompensating, will need intubation, trauma line or
   cordis, emergent TIPS.
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Currently being treated for HAP. CXR this AM with
   stable findings. Fever increased white count may be related to
   aspiration pneumonitis given CT scan findings.
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem -day 1 = [**11-21**]
   - FU CXR AM
   - Sputum Cultures
   - FU Blood Cultures
   - FU Urine Cultures
   - C. Diff Toxin
   - Consider double coverage for pseudomonas if decompensates.
   .
   # Hepatic encephalopathy. Per OSH report has been encephalopathic,
   however today patient does not appear encephalopathic, no asterixis.
   Diagnostic paracentesis on this admission negative for SBP.
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO.
   .
   # ESLD. Hep C and EtOH as above. Actively drinking.
   - Diuretic regimen sp TIPS today.
   - IR will evaluate for therapeutic tap during procedure, Albumin if
   Large Volume sp Tap, Fu with IR
   - Management of varices as above.
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin once taking Pos.
   .
   # Dyspnea: Sats mid 90s on 4L. Crackles at bases bilaterally, and
   patient did receive IV fluids prior to transfer and overnight given
   borderline blood pressures. On Vancomycin and Meropenem for hospital
   acquired pneumonia.
   - continue Vancomycin and Meropenem -day 1 = [**11-21**]
   - FU CXR
   - Continue O2 therapy.
   - Lasix  once blood pressure stablilizes sp procedure.

1. Re-bleeding: The patient has recurrent GI bleeding, and there is a risk of further bleeding episodes.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of EtOH abuse and HCV cirrhosis, which puts him at risk for hepatic encephalopathy.
3. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and there is a risk of developing other infections due to immunosuppression.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient has a low platelet count and elevated creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction.

","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent lower GI bleeding. The patient has known esophageal varices that were previously banded. Colonoscopy on admission was negative for the source of bleeding. The differential diagnosis includes rectal varices, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), diverticulosis, or a brisk upper GI bleed secondary to portal hypertensive gastropathy, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastritis, or esophagitis. NG lavage performed this afternoon was negative.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 86 beats per minute, blood pressure of 101/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula, and a blood glucose level of 125 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the bases bilaterally, regular heart rhythm with normal S1 and S2, soft systolic murmur at the apex, and 1+ lower extremity edema. Neurological examination shows alert and oriented patient with intact cranial nerves and strength 5/5 in distal upper and lower extremities.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 10.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.4 g/dL,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis. He was admitted to the hospital due to a variceal bleed and has been transferred to the MICU for management of recurrent lower GI bleeding. The patient's vital signs are as follows: Tcurrent: 38.4 C, HR: 86 bpm, BP: 101/50 mmHg, RR: 31 insp/min, SpO2: 93%. The patient has received various treatments including IVF, blood transfusion, TIPS procedure, and antibiotic therapy. The patient's lab results show elevated liver enzymes and low albumin levels. The patient's imaging and microbiology reports are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper vs Lower GI bleed: The patient has known esophageal varices, which were previously banded. However, the patient is experiencing recurrent lower GI bleeding. Close monitoring and appropriate management are required to prevent further bleeding and potential complications such as hypotension and shock.

2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy. Monitoring for signs and symptoms of encephalopathy, such as asterixis and altered mental status, is essential. Lactulose and rifaximin can be used for treatment and prevention.

3. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP): The patient is currently being treated for HAP with vancomycin and meropenem."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis. He was admitted to the hospital with a variceal bleed and transferred to the MICU for recurrent GI bleeding. The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Upper vs Lower GI bleed: The patient has known esophageal varices, which were previously banded. A colonoscopy performed on [**11-21**] did not reveal any source of bleeding, suggesting that the current GI bleed is likely of upper origin.

2. TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) has been planned for today to manage the recurrent GI bleeding.

3. The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) and receiving pantoprazole and octreotide infusions to control the upper GI bleed.

4. Nadolol, a beta-blocker used for variceal prophylaxis, has been withheld due to the acute bleeding episode.

5. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem) for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) during the bleed and also for hospital-acquired pneumonia coverage.

6. The patient's INR (international normalized ratio) needs to be kept below 1.5, platelets above 50,000, and hematocrit (Hct) above 30 to manage the bleeding risk.

7. Fever and leukocytosis: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). A chest X-ray showed stable findings, and the fever curve is trending down.

8. Hypocalcemia: The patient has a corrected calcium level of 8.2, indicating hypocalcemia. An ionized calcium level will be measured in the morning.

9. Hepatic encephalopathy: Although the patient has been reported to be encephalopathic previously, he does not appear to have hepatic encephalopathy at present. Diagnostic paracentesis on this admission was negative for SBP.

10. ESLD (end-stage liver disease): The patient has a history of EtOH and HCV, leading to ESLD. The patient's HCV viral load is significantly elevated at 1,420,000 IU/mL. A therapeutic tap during TIPS procedure will be evaluated, and albumin will be administered if needed. The patient is also on lactulose/rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy management.

11. Dyspnea: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are in the mid-90s on 4 liters of oxygen. Crackles at the bases bilaterally indicate possible pulmonary edema or fluid overload. The patient is receiving treatment for HAP with vancomycin and meropenem.

12. EtOH abuse: Thiamine and folate supplementation is recommended for the patient's long-term management.

13. Tobacco abuse: Nicotine patches are being used for smoking cessation.

14. FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition): The patient is NPO, has replete electrolytes, and will not receive intravenous fluids.

15. Prophylaxis measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

The patient's current medical complications include upper GI bleed, potential hypocalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, ESLD, dysp"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of cirrhosis and hepatitis C, admitted to the ICU for recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. He has undergone banding of esophageal varices and a colonoscopy, both of which were negative for the source of bleeding. The patient's current condition includes fever and leukocytosis, potentially related to aspiration pneumonitis. He also has hepatic encephalopathy, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), dyspnea, and a history of EtOH and tobacco abuse. The patient is currently receiving various treatments including antibiotics, vasopressin, proton pump inhibitors, and diuretics. His vital signs are stable with some fluctuations in blood pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has a history of esophageal varices and recurrent GI bleeding. There is a high risk of further bleeding episodes or complications such as perforation or necrosis.
2. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has ESLD and hepatic encephalopathy. If not managed properly, this can lead to worsening neurological symptoms and increased risk of infections.
3. Infection: The patient is already being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and there is a possibility of developing other infections due to his immunocompromised state.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings show borderline to low values, indicating a risk of hypotension, which can lead to shock"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent GI bleeding. The patient has known esophageal varices that were previously banded, and a colonoscopy performed on [**11-21**] was negative for the source of bleeding. The patient's current condition is complicated by ESLD (end-stage liver disease), Hepatitis C, and alcohol abuse. He is also experiencing dyspnea, fever, leukocytosis, hepatic encephalopathy, and ESLD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper versus Lower GI Bleeding: The patient has a known history of esophageal varices, which are likely the source of the upper GI bleeding. However, the negative colonoscopy suggests that there may not be a lower GI bleed. Close monitoring of vital signs, coagulation parameters, and hemodynamic stability is necessary.

2. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, characterized by altered mental status and asterixis. Regular monitoring of neurologic status, electrolyte balance, and toxin levels is essential.

3. Hospital-acquired Pneumonia (HAP): The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of HAP, as indicated by the presence of fever, leukocytosis, and infiltrates on chest X-ray. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and sputum cultures"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol (EtOH) and Hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis. He was admitted to the OSH with variceal bleeding and then transferred back to the MICU for recurrent GI bleeding. The patient has known esophageal varices, which were banded on 11/21. A colonoscopy on 11/21 at OSH was negative for the source of bleeding. NG lavage last night after transfer to MICU was positive, indicating an upper GI source.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Upper vs Lower GI bleed: The most likely source of bleeding is the upper GI tract due to known esophageal varices.
- TIPS procedure today
- Hold nadolol in the setting of acute bleed
- NPO (nothing by mouth)
- PPI (proton pump inhibitor) gtt (continuous)
- Octreotide gtt
- Meropenem for SBP prophylaxis during bleed (has cephalosporin allergy). Meropenem is also being used for broad-spectrum coverage for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).
- Keep INR < 1.5, platelets > 50, Hct >30.

2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is currently being treated for HAP. CXR this morning showed stable findings. Fever increased white count is likely related to HAP"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent GI bleeding. He has known esophageal varices that were previously banded, and a colonoscopy performed at OSH was negative for the source of bleeding. The patient's current condition includes bloody secretions in the endotracheal tube, likely due to either GI bleed aspiration or hemoptysis from pneumonia. There is a concern for potential medical complications such as upper vs lower GI bleed, intubation procedure-related bleeding, fever/leukocytosis (treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia), hepatic encephalopathy, ESLD (end-stage liver disease), dyspnea (related to pneumonia), EtOH abuse, tobacco abuse, and FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition) management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper vs Lower GI Bleed: The patient has a history of esophageal varices, which were previously banded. However, the current presentation suggests a possible upper GI bleed. Close monitoring and repeated assessments are necessary to determine the source of bleeding and appropriate interventions.

2. Intubation Procedure-Related Bleeding: The presence of bloody secretions in the endotracheal tube raises concerns about bleeding related to the intubation procedure. Further evaluation and bronchoscopic examination may be required to identify and manage any bleeding sources.

There has been no obvious bleeding over the last 2-3 days, and no transfusion is required.

The patient's current conditions include:
1. Intubation: The patient has a blood on suction yesterday, with some bleeding identified in the left lower lobe. A CT chest is planned today. The plan is to maintain intubation with hopes for repeat tips tomorrow. Propofol is discontinued due to hypotension, and switched to versed/fentanyl.
2. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is currently being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). CXR this morning shows stable findings. The white count is trending down, but the patient did spike temperature yesterday, which could be secondary to blood aspiration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol (EtOH) and Hepatitis C (HCV) cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for management of recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. The patient underwent banding of esophageal varices on [**11-21**] and colonoscopy on [**11-21**] which was negative for any source of bleeding. The patient has been intubated due to dyspnea and bleeding in the left lower lobe identified on bronchoscopy. The patient's current medications include PPI, octreotide, meropenem, fentanyl, propofol, vancomycin, lasix, lactulose/rifaximin, thiamine, folate, nicotine patch, and boots. The patient's recent laboratory results show stable hematocrit levels, elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated liver enzymes, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies reveal bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, consistent with the patient's known cirrhosis, as well as dependent consolidations and ground-glass density in the lungs, likely due to atelectasis with possible superimposed infection. The patient has an upcoming Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) procedure tomorrow and various other follow-up plans.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of EtOH and HCV"

   Etiology of hemoptysis unclear
 given clear CXR, new infiltrate, not
   profoundly coagulopathic, seems most likely pna though amount of
   hemorrhage without coagulopathy is concerning.  Will check chest CT
   non-con today.  Currently on Vanc meropenem.  Wean PSV as able, but
   will likely keep intubated for planned TIPs on Monday.
   Varcieal bleed
 for repeat TIPs likely Monday.  Hcts are stable.
   Pressor requirements correlates with propofol, now both off.  C/o
   anxiety, will try PRN versed, fentanyl, zyprexa.
   Access is 4 PIVs, for now hold off on CVL unless recurrent pressor
   requirement or further instability.

   Etiology of hemoptysis unclear
 given clear CXR, new infiltrate, not
   profoundly coagulopathic, seems most likely pna though amount of
   hemorrhage without coagulopathy is concerning.  Will check chest CT
   non-con today.  Currently on Vanc meropenem.  Wean PSV as able, but
   will likely keep intubated for planned TIPs on Monday.
   Varcieal bleed
 for repeat TIPs likely Monday.  Hcts are stable.
   Pressor requirements correlates with propofol, now both off.  C/o
   anxiety, will try PRN versed, fentanyl, zyprexa.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol (EtOH) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He was admitted with variceal bleeding and underwent banding of esophageal varices. The patient has a history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, and it is unclear whether it is an upper or lower GI bleed. Colonoscopy was negative for the source of bleeding. The patient's current condition includes bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, likely due to cirrhosis. He also has dependent consolidations and ground-glass density on chest CT, which are likely a component of atelectasis with a possible superimposed infectious component. There is no evidence of tuberculous disease.

The patient has been treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem. His fever and leukocytosis have improved, but he still has a fever spike. The patient's hepatic encephalopathy has improved, and he is not currently encephalopathic. He has a history of ethanol abuse and is actively drinking. Diagnostic paracentesis on admission was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

The patient's dyspnea is being treated with continued vancomycin and meropenem for HAP. Diuretics are being initiated for TIPS procedure today. The patient's end-stage liver disease (ESLD) is due to chronic alcohol abuse and HCV infection. He has"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to the ICU for variceal bleeding. The patient underwent a TIPS procedure and had nearly 3.5L of ascites removed. The patient also received albumin post-paracentesis to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.

The patient's current vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/54 to 86/43 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation with PSV/SBT mode, FiO2 set at 50%, and RSBI of 16.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 3,989 mL with an output of 4,565 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -576 mL. The patient has been receiving octreotide and pantoprazole infusions. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 14.5 K/uL, slightly decreased hemoglobin (Hct) levels ranging from 32.0% to 35.3%, and normal platelet count (Plt) at 121 K/uL. Liver enzymes such as ALT/AST are within normal limits, while albumin level is low at 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   55M with EtOH/HCV cirrhosis, admitted to OSH with variceal bleed,
   transferred back to [**Hospital1 1**] MICU for management of recurrent GI
   bleeding.
   .
   # Upper vs Lower GI bleed:  In cirrhotic patient with known esophageal
   varices, which were banded on [**11-21**]. Colonoscopy on [**11-21**] at OSH negative
   for source of bleeding. No obvious bleeding over the last 2-3 days. No
   transfusion required.
   - Follow up TIPS today
   - Follow GI Recs
   - Hold nadolol in the setting of acute bleed
   - NPO
   - Continue PPI gtt, Octreotide gtt
   - Continue Meropenem for SBP prophylaxis during bleed (has
   cephalosporin allergy; Meropenem also has broad spectrum coverage for
   HAP)
   - Keep INR < 1.5, platelets > 50, Hct >30.
   - Continue [**Hospital1 **] Hct
   .
   # Dyspnea; Intubation s/p procedure: Blood on suction yesterday. With
   some bleeding in left lower lobe indentified on bronch.
   - Plan to maintain intubation; hope to extubated s/p TIPS
   - Discontinue midazolam
   - Fentanyl/propofol prn
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem - day 2 of 4
   - Continue O2 therapy
   - Restart lasix once BP stabilize s/p procedure
   .
   # Fever/Leukocytosis: Currently being treated for HAP. CXR this AM with
   stable findings. White count trending down. Patient did spike
   temperature yesterday, however this could be secondary to blood
   aspiration.
   - Continue Vancomycin and Meropenem - day 2 of 4
   - Obtain vanc trough
   - Follow up daily AM CXR
   - Follow up cultures including c. diff
   - Consider double coverage for pseudomonas if decompensates
   .
   # Hepatic encephalopathy. Per OSH report has been encephalopathic,
   however today patient does not appear encephalopathic, no asterixis.
   Diagnostic paracentesis on this admission negative for SBP.
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO (likely to be for
   tomorrow)
   .
   # ESLD. Hep C and EtOH as above. Actively drinking.  HCV VL as above.
   - Restart lasix once BP stabilize s/p procedure
   - Management of varices as above
   - Continue lactulose/rifaximin once taking PO (likely to be for
   tomorrow)
   - Follow up GI/hepatology
   .
   # EtOH abuse.
   - Continue thiamine and folate.
   .
   # Tobacco abuse.
   - Nicotine patch.
   .
   # FEN: No IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   # Prophylaxis: boots, PPI.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 55-year-old male with a history of alcohol (EtOH) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis. He was admitted to the hospital with a variceal bleed and underwent Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) placement. 

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions that need to be managed:

1. Upper vs Lower GI bleed: The patient has known esophageal varices, which were previously banded. A colonoscopy did not reveal any source of bleeding. No transfusion is required at this time.

2. Dyspnea; Intubation s/p procedure: The patient has been intubated due to dyspnea and aspiration of blood during the procedure. The plan is to maintain intubation until after the TIPS procedure.

3. Fever/Leukocytosis: The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem. His white blood cell count is trending down, and a chest X-ray shows stable findings.

4. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has been encephalopathic, but today he appears alert without asterixis. Diagnostic paracentesis was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).

5. ESLD (End-Stage Liver Disease): The patient has ESLD due to HCV and EtOH abuse."
