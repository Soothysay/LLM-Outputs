   stable.  Likely small esophageal tear from several days of vomiting.
   - Pm hct check
   - zofran PRN nausea
   # Lipase elevation:  CT scan last night without evidence of
   pancreatitis, no evidence of of gall stones.  Pt scheduled for RUQ
   ultrasound in AM to further assess for radiolucent stones, but given
   improvement in exam, will defer this for now.  Elevated enzymes may be
   related to DKA process.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently being treated with insulin and D5, which has resulted in an improvement in her anion gap acidosis. The plan is to continue monitoring her anion gap and electrolytes every 4 hours, decrease the insulin infusion rate, and maintain blood glucose levels between 150-250. Additionally, urine ketones will be followed every 4-6 hours.

The patient also had episodes of hematemesis, likely due to a small esophageal tear caused by prolonged vomiting. Her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is stable, and a follow-up Hct check is planned. Nausea is being managed with ondansetron (Zofran) as needed.

The patient's lipase levels are elevated, but a CT scan last night showed no evidence of pancreatitis or gallstones. An RUQ ultrasound is scheduled for further assessment of possible radiolucent stones. Repeat lipase levels will be monitored, and IV fluids will be administered.

The patient's electrolytes, including potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), will be closely monitored. Her respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen with a SpO2 of 99%.

The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control with insulin, and"

There was an elevation in lipase levels, but a CT scan did not show any signs of pancreatitis. The patient will have a repeat lipase test today, continue with IV fluids, and clear any other medications as needed. An RUQ ultrasound is scheduled to assess for radiolucent stones.

The patient's electrolytes are being managed with repletion as needed, with frequent checks every 4 hours. Her nutritional needs are being met, and she is receiving insulin to maintain glycemic control. She has multiple lines inserted, including a 20-gauge line on [**2165-1-14**] at 05:13 PM. Pro"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently receiving insulin and D5 intravenous fluids, which has improved her anion gap acidosis. The plan is to continue monitoring her electrolytes and adjust insulin dosage accordingly. The patient's blood glucose levels should be maintained between 200-250 mg/dL.

Additionally, the patient had hematemesis, likely due to a small esophageal tear from prolonged vomiting. Her nausea has improved, and her hematocrit (Hct) levels are stable. Further monitoring of her Hct levels is recommended.

There was an elevation in lipase levels, but a CT scan showed no evidence of pancreatitis or gallstones. An RUQ ultrasound will be performed in the morning to further investigate. Repeat lipase levels and IV fluids will also be administered.

The patient's electrolytes need to be managed, and she should be repleted with PRN (as needed) electrolytes. Frequent checks for electrolyte imbalances will be conducted every 4 hours.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and appropriate line management. Prophylactic measures such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention are in place."

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight male with no acute distress. He is currently being treated for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperchloremic acidosis, and pneumonia in the ICU. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is maintained on an insulin infusion at a rate of 2 units/hour. He has received volume resuscitation and potassium repletion. An abdominal CT scan was performed due to pain and elevated lipase levels, but no acute pathology was found. The patient's blood glucose levels are now within the normal range, and the anion gap has resolved. However, the patient still requires additional electrolyte repletion, particularly potassium and magnesium. The patient's abdominal exam has improved, but the lipase levels remain elevated. There is a subtle infiltrate on the chest X-ray, suggesting pneumonia, but the patient is asymptomatic. The patient admits to minimal alcohol ingestion. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Hypoglycemia: Since the patient is on an insulin infusion, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dosage is not adjusted properly.
2. Hypokalemia: The patient requires potassium repletion, and there is a risk of"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been receiving insulin intravenously with improvements in her anion gap acidosis. Her total insulin requirements between midnight and 8 am are 15 units. The bicarbonate level has decreased again to 16, and it is advised not to discontinue the insulin infusion until the bicarbonate level reaches 20. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37°C (98.6°F), heart rate of 65 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal readings, and she is well-nourished without any acute distress. 

The patient has mildly tender epigastric and RUQ regions with bowel sounds present. Her extremities have 2+ distal pulses, and her skin is warm. Neurologically, she is lethargic but arousable and responsive to questions. 

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), glucose, amylase, and lipase. Other lab values such as creatinine (Cr), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4) are within normal limits. 

The assessment and plan include continued insulin gtt and dextrose gtt to keep glucose levels between 150-250 mg/dL. The patient will start square (sq) insulin with Lantus 25 units now and Humalog at meals. It is planned to discontinue the insulin gtt 2 hours after starting Lantus. Urine ketones will be checked every 4-6 hours. 

The patient also has an assessment for lipase elevation, which is likely related to the DKA process. There is no evidence of pancreatitis on the CT scan, and the patient is scheduled for an RUQ ultrasound to further assess for radiolucent stones. 

Additional plans include maintaining fluid balance, electrolyte repletion, and continuation of a diabetic diet. The patient is expected to be called out of the ICU when she is off insulin gtt."

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-inch tall individual with a chief complaint of dka. They have been diagnosed with uncomplicated pancreatitis and have shown improvement in abdominal pain. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/68 to 127/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged except for better abdominal pain. 

Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient's high blood glucose levels, ketones in the urine, and acid-base imbalance indicate ongoing DKA.
2. Pancreatitis - The patient has been diagnosed with uncomplicated pancreatitis, which may lead to complications such as pancreatic necrosis or abscess formation if not managed properly.
3. Hypoglycemia - Insulin therapy may increase the risk of hypoglycemia, particularly if the patient's bicarbonate levels decrease and insulin dosage is not adjusted accordingly.
4. Fluid imbalances - The patient's fluid balance sheet shows a positive balance, indicating potential fluid overload or inadequate fluid resuscitation.
5. Infection - The patient is at risk for hospital-acquired infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the use of mechanical ventilation."

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, overweight/obese individual who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and abdominal pain. The patient's anion gap has normalized, and they have been maintained on IV insulin overnight. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed evidence of pancreatitis, and the patient's abdominal pain has improved. Potassium repletion continues.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. The patient's anion gap has normalized, indicating improvement, but close monitoring and management of blood glucose levels are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Pancreatitis: The CT scan of the abdomen showed evidence of pancreatitis, which is inflammation of the pancreas. This condition can lead to abdominal pain and can complicate the course of the patient's illness. It is important to monitor the patient's symptoms and consider appropriate treatment options.
3. Electrolyte imbalance: The patient's potassium levels are being repleted, suggesting an electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring of electrolytes is crucial to prevent further imbalances that can lead to cardiac arrhythmias or other complications.
4. Potential infection: The patient has been discussed during interdisciplinary rounds, indicating that there may be concerns about potential infections or other complications. Close monitoring of vital signs and clinical symptoms is important to identify any signs of"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Initially, she was transitioned off IV insulin, but her blood sugar levels remained high in the 400s. As a result, the IV insulin was restarted, and her blood sugar levels improved. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She is alert and oriented but appears lethargic. Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, no acute distress, and mild tenderness in the epigastric and right upper quadrant regions. Laboratory results show elevated levels of glucose (331 mg/dL), low potassium (2.7 mEq/L), and slightly elevated white blood cell count (11.0 K/uL). Other lab values, including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, creatinine, and liver enzymes, are within normal ranges. The patient is receiving insulin via intravenous infusion and has been started on dextrose infusion to maintain blood sugar levels between 150-250 mg/dL. She will be consulted with an endocrinologist later today to discuss initiating subcutaneous insulin. The patient is also being monitored for potential complications such as"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite being transitioned off insulin yesterday, the patient required restarting IV insulin due to uncontrolled high sugars. The patient's glucose levels have improved on the insulin IV. 

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 61 bpm, blood pressure of 122/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. 

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the absence of chest pain, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,309 mL of fluids since midnight, including 1,560 mL of PO, 749 mL of IV fluids, and 200 mL of blood products. The patient's urine output has been 1,900 mL since midnight. 

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly elevated hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels have fluctuated between 74 mg/dL and 331 mg/dL, with the most recent reading being 98 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated ALT and AST levels.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis: The patient's DKA has improved with the restart of insulin IV. The plan is to continue insulin and dextrose gtt to keep glucose levels between 150-250 mg/dL. The patient will be discussed with an endocrinologist regarding initiating subcutaneous insulin later today.

2. Hematemesis: The patient has shown no vomiting since admission, and her hematocrit levels are stable. It is likely that the patient has a small esophageal tear from several days of vomiting. The plan is to continue Zofran PRN for nausea and discontinue PPI.

3. CAP: There are no signs of pneumonia on exam or lab values. The plan is to discontinue azithromycin.

4. Lipase elevation: The patient's lipase levels are elevated, but clinically there is no evidence of pancreatitis on exam. The enzymes are trending down. 

5. FEN (fluid, electrolyte, and nutrition): The patient's lytes are replete with q8 checks. The plan is to maintain urine output >50 mL/hr, replete lytes with attention to K and phosphate, continue diabetic diet, and call out of ICU when off insulin gtt.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hyperglycemia: The patient's glucose levels remain uncontrolled despite being on insulin therapy. It is important to closely monitor and adjust insulin dosage to maintain glucose levels within the target range.

2. Hypoglycemia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite being transitioned off intravenous insulin yesterday, the patient's blood sugars remained in the 400s and required restarting the insulin drip. Currently, the patient's sugars are being controlled on insulin iv, and the plan is to continue the insulin gtt and dextrose gtt to keep glucoses between 150-250. The patient will also start subcutaneous insulin with Lantus 25 and Humalog at meals, with a plan to discontinue the insulin gtt 2 hours after starting Lantus. Urine ketones will be monitored every 4-6 hours, and a consultation has been requested regarding initiating subcutaneous insulin and later pump insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient initially presented with DKA, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. It requires prompt medical intervention to correct the metabolic abnormalities and prevent complications.
2. Hypoglycemia: With the initiation of insulin therapy, there is a risk of hypoglycemia if the insulin dosage is not properly adjusted in relation to the patient's dietary intake.
3. Infection: Immunosuppression due to poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of infections, including urinary tract infections, respiratory infections,"

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished, obese individual in the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood sugars rose yesterday afternoon, so they were placed back on an insulin infusion. The anion gap remained within the normal range, and the abdominal pain has nearly resolved. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 124/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and temperature of 36.7°C. The patient is receiving various medications including insulin, azithromycin, zofran, and protonix. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,309 mL, output of 1,900 mL, and a positive balance of 409 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support and has normal ABG results. The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of conjunctival pallor or scleral edema. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI, S1, S2, and no murmurs. Respiratory examination is clear with good air movement bilaterally. Abdominal examination is soft, non-tender, and obese. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, oriented to person, place, and time, and has purposeful movement. Laboratory results indicate normal levels of hemoglobin, leukocyte count, creatinine, potassium, sodium, chloride,"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and required insulin therapy. Initially, the patient was on an insulin pump, but it was found that the pump was not functioning properly. Subcutaneous injections of insulin were administered, which resulted in better control of blood sugar levels. The patient also experienced episodes of low blood sugar, which were treated with dextrose.

Vital signs were stable, with a temperature within normal range and controlled blood pressure and heart rate. Respiratory support was not required, and oxygen delivery devices were not used. Hemodynamic monitoring showed no abnormalities, and fluid balance was maintained.

Laboratory results indicated elevated glucose levels, along with high levels of white blood cells and creatinine. Electrolyte imbalances were observed, including low potassium and magnesium levels. Liver function tests were within normal limits, while kidney function showed signs of slight impairment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced episodes of low blood sugar, indicating the need for careful monitoring and prompt treatment to prevent further hypoglycemic episodes.
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA, a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketone production, and metabolic acidosis. Prompt management of DKA is crucial to prevent complications such as cerebral edema, cardiac arrhythmias, and multi-organ failure.
3. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count suggests"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The DKA has since resolved, but the patient continues to have elevated blood sugars, most likely due to a malfunctioning insulin pump. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 123/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and sinus rhythm. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1,441 mL, with 840 mL administered via the oral route, 601 mL via intravenous fluids, and 700 mL output through urine. The patient's respiratory support is not required as she is breathing spontaneously. 

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. Her heart and cardiovascular system are normal, with regular heart sounds and no murmurs or rubs. Her abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. Neurologically, she is lethargic but arousable and responsive to questions.

Laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose at 146 mg/dL, but other parameters such as white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count are within normal limits. The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 0.8 mg/dL, while liver enzymes (ALT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Despite transitioning off insulin yesterday, her blood sugars remained elevated in the 300s. Changes were made to the insulin pump sensitivity, but it did not work effectively. The patient then received subcutaneous insulin injections, which resulted in improved blood sugar control. The patient's blood sugar levels were low in the morning and required treatment with dextrose. She has no known drug allergies.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient presented with DKA and required insulin therapy to manage her blood sugar levels. DKA is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when the body produces high levels of blood acids called ketones. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
2. Hematemesis: The patient had episodes of vomiting, which may have caused a small esophageal tear. This can lead to ongoing bleeding and potential complications if not managed properly.
3. Acute pancreatitis: The patient had elevated lipase levels, indicating a possible case of acute pancreatitis. However, further evaluation with a CT scan showed no complications or evidence of pancreatitis.
4. Electrolyte imbalances: DKA can cause significant shifts in electrolyte levels, including potassium, sodium, chloride, and phosphate. These imbalances need to be monitored and corrected"

","The patient is a 21-year-old female with a history of type I diabetes mellitus who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA has now been resolved, but the patient continues to have elevated blood sugars, likely due to a malfunctioning insulin pump. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 123/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 12.6 g/dL, blood glucose level of 146 mg/dL, potassium level of 0.7 mg/dL, sodium level of 137 mEq/L, chloride level of 101 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 36.0%, and creatinine level of 0.7 mg/dL. The patient's liver enzymes (ALT and AST) are slightly elevated, as well as lipase levels, but these are expected due to the DKA process.

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing aggressive insulin subcutaneous injections, monitoring blood glucose levels, and following up with an endocrinologist for recommendations on switching to subcutaneous insulin. The patient will also be evaluated by a gastroenterologist for initiating subcutaneous insulin later today.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with no acute distress. They have a history of diabetes and are currently admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's blood sugar levels have been fluctuating, with readings ranging from 300-400 mg/dL despite being off insulin. Changes were made to the insulin pump sensitivity, but it did not work effectively, leading to the conclusion that the pump is not functioning properly. The patient also experienced low blood sugar levels, which were treated with Pos.
The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4 C (97.5 F), heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 123/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,441 mL, including 840 mL orally, 601 mL intravenously, and total output of 700 mL. The patient is not on respiratory support.
The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of glucose at 188 mg/dL, slightly low hemoglobin (Hct) at 35.6%, and normal white blood cell count (WBC) at 11.0 K/uL. Other lab values, including creatinine (Cr), potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), carbon dioxide (CO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3-), are within normal"
