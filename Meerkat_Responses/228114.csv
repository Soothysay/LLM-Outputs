 BACTEREMIA
   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #0 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved at present. Most concerning for evolving sepsis
   given known bacteremia and immunocompromised status. Cardiogenic,
   hypovolemic, or obstructive etiology less likely.
   - No need for bolus at present give pt is normotensive
   - If needed, would bolus with 1L D5 3amps bicarb as resuscitation fluid
   given renal failure metabolic acidosis and maintain MAP>65
   - changed sedation from propofol to Dexmedetomidine to decrease
   hypotension, but weaning sedation nonetheless
   - maintain PIVs, would like to avoid central access if possible given
   need for line holiday given high grade VRE bacteremia
   - broad abx (dapto and zosyn) as below
   - if pressors/central line needed, will discuss placing HD catheter
   with VIP port with renal since likely to need HD
   - If HD needed will need HD catheter placed, will d/w reanl
   # VRE bacteremia: Patient with high grade VRE bacteremia but recent
   blood cx [**2-9**] NGTD and now has had removal of one source of infection
   (basilic vein) as well as PICC. Could also consider endocarditis as
   possibility but TTE negative
   - continue daptomycin per ID recommendations; continue zosyn for broad
   coverage and fever and neutropenia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider adding linezolid if continues to have positive blood cx or
   increased MIC to dapto
   - consider TEE while intubated but unlikely to currently change
   management, will make sure to discuss with BMT and ID
   # Anuric ARF: Patient with rapidly progressive renal failure last 48
   hours, likely related to ATN from hypotension as well as gentamycin (3
   doses [**Date range (1) 120**]). UOP 275cc last 24 hours, previously 850cc prior 24
   hours. nephrology following and medicatiosn redosed for creatinine
   clearance, may need CVVH next 24-72 hours if remains anuric/oliguric.
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - If hypotensive again, recommend maintaining renal perfusion and
   correct metaboli acidosis with boluses D5 with bicarb
   - renally dose meds, will discuss holding acyclovir with BMT
   # Intubation: Kept intubated overnight for white cell infusion. Patient
   remained post-operatively intubated for unclear reasons. Per
   anesthesia, had tachypnea pre-op but CXR relatively clear and without
   infiltrate other than possible pulmonary edema but difficult to
   interpret in setting of low lung volumes. Oxygen saturations 100% on
   60%.
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% and check ABG
   - change to PSV ventilation
   - short acting sedation to enable probable extubation in am
   - Will wait to make sure no procedures need to be completed before
   extubation, will d/w consulting teams
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: WBC improved from 0.2 to 0.5
   after infusion. Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and clofarabine and
   ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and
   decreased ability to clear infection and bacteremia.
   - Monitor CBC w/diff after granulocyte infusion
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - Touch base with renal and BMT if we should continue ppx with
   voriconazole and acyclovir
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily
   as per prior ID recs

","Based on the provided information, here is a summary of the patient's progress note and potential medical complications that can arise:

Summary:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and persistent neutropenia.
- She was admitted with high-grade VRE bacteremia attributed to a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis.
- The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room, intubated with transient hypotension.
- She remains intubated and sedated.
- The patient has a history of hypotension, renal failure, pancytopenia, and bacteremia.
- She is currently being treated for VRE bacteremia and sepsis.
- The patient also has anuric acute renal failure, likely related to ATN from hypotension and gentamicin.
- She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and will be evaluated for endocarditis.
- The patient's low lung volumes limit ETT tip placement, and there is concern for pulmonary edema.
- She has biphenotypic leukemia with persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple organ systems.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's known bacteremia and immunocompromised status increase the risk of developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and early intervention are crucial.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #0 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient initially transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] with hypotension
   on peripheral neo but upon arrival, weaned off pressors immediately
   with MAPs in 60s. Hypotension most likely related to sedation intra-op
   but also concerning for evolving sepsis given known bacteremia and
   immunocompromised status. Cardiogenic or obstructive etiology less
   likely.
   - bolus with 1L D5 3amps bicarb as resuscitation fluid given renal
   failure and maintain MAP>65
   - change sedation from propofol to Dexmedetomidine to decrease
   hypotension
   - maintain PIVs, would like to avoid central access if possible given
   need for line holiday
   - broad abx (dapto and zosyn) as below
   - if pressors/central line needed, will discuss placing HD catheter
   with VIP port with renal since likely to need HD
   # VRE bacteremia: Patient with high grade VRE bacteremia but recent
   blood cx [**2-9**] NGTD and now has had removal of one source of infection
   (basilic vein) as well as PICC. Could also consider endocarditis as
   possibility but TTE negative
   - continue daptomycin per ID recommendations; continue zosyn for broad
   coverage and fever and neutropenia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider adding linezolid if continues to have positive blood cx or
   increased MIC to dapto
   - consider TEE while intubated but unlikely to currently change
   management
   # ARF: Patient with rapidly progressive renal failure last 48 hours,
   likely related to ATN from hypotension as well as gentamycin (3 doses
   [**Date range (1) 120**]). UOP 275cc last 24 hours, previously 850cc prior 24 hours.
   nephrology following and medicatiosn redosed for creatinine clearance,
   may need CVVH next 24-72 hours if remains anuric/oliguric.
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - maintain renal perfusion and correct metaboli acidosis with boluses
   D5 with bicarb
   - renally dose meds, will discuss holding acyclovir with BMT
   # Intubation: Patient remains intubated for unclear reasons. Per
   anesthesia, had tachypnea pre-op but CXR relatively clear and without
   infiltrate other than possible pulmonary edema but difficult to
   interpret in setting of low lung volumes. Oxygen saturations 100% on
   60%. No reason to expect she will be difficult to extubate but given
   granulocyte infusion overnight will keep intubated for now for airway
   protection and risk of hemodynamic instability
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% and check ABG
   - change to PSV ventilation
   - short acting sedation to enable extubation in am
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2,
   MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia
   - granulocyte infusion overnight per BMT recommendations with
   premedication and CBC pre and post
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue ppx with voriconazole and acyclovir
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily
   as per prior ID recs
   # FEN: NPO, replete lytes, bolus 1L D5W with bicarb

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred to the ICU intubated with transient hypotension. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure (ARF), pancytopenia, and intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which may be related to sedation during surgery or evolving sepsis. It is important to maintain adequate blood pressure and prevent further complications such as organ hypoperfusion or shock.

2. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which can lead to septicemia and potentially life-threatening complications like septic shock. Proper antibiotic therapy and source control measures should be continued to manage this condition.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has rapidly progressive renal failure, likely due to ATN from hypotension and gentamicin administration. Close monitoring of renal function and fluid balance is necessary to prevent further deterioration and complications such as fluid overload or electrolyte imbalances.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding and infection. Regular monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #2 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension.
   # SEPSIS, high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC
   Blood cultures still turning positive. Needs line for HD.
   - IR guided IJ with VIP port after discussing with BMT
   - continue broad coverage antibiotics
   - continue surveillance cultures
   - f/u blood cultures, path from surgery
   - f/u ID recs
   # ARF, anuric
   Likely ATN from hypotension vs gent
   - HD this pm pending line placement
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - If hypotensive again, recommend maintaining renal perfusion and
   correct metaboli acidosis with boluses D5 with bicarb
   - holding acyclovir
   # Intubation: Kept intubated for line placement and out of concern for
   mental status although ventilating well.
   - likely will extubate after line placement
   # Acid-Base
   Has normal pH of 7.4 so likely has two primary disorders. Gap metabolic
   acidosis from renal failure. Respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis,
   partially compensatory for acidosis.
   - monitor
   # Mental status
   Concerning as not on any sedation and BUN not that elevated.
   - If not improved after HD, will w/u further, consider MRi
   # Hypotension:
   Improved with lifting of sedation
   - monitor
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: Got another WBC transfusion.
   Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with
   persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to
   clear infection and bacteremia.
   - Monitor CBC w/diff after granulocyte infusion
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory issues. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has a history of oncology and has been receiving acyclovir, which has been discontinued. He received a WBC transfusion and will be kept intubated overnight. Tube feeds have been started, and a nutrition consult has been requested. The patient is unable to provide history as he is sedated. His allergies include morphine, nausea/vomiting, and he has received piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) antibiotics. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/52 mmHg to 172/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the presence of an OG/NG tube. 

Flowsheet data shows that the patient has received a total of 2,655 mL of fluids, with 499 mL given in the last 24 hours. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 105.5 kg. The patient's blood products include a transfusion of 259 mL and 291 mL. The patient's urine output is 115 mL and 25 mL, respectively. 

The patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal volume of 605 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 11 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%. The patient's respiratory support parameters indicate a respiratory system compliance (RSBI) of 29 and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 455. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.41, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 22, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 182, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 12%. The patient's ventilation rate is 10.9 L/min. 

Physical examination findings include the presence of an OG tube, normal heart sounds (S1 and S2), and peripheral pulses. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to the patient being sedated. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 73 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 22.8%, platelet count (Plt) of 89 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.6 mg/dL, blood glucose of 122 mg/dL, and other lab abnormalities including elevated lactate level, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The patient's electrolytes are within normal range. The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and pancytopenia. 

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition remains in the ICU."

   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #0 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension.
   .
   # Hypotension: Resolved at present. Most concerning for evolving sepsis
   given known bacteremia and immunocompromised status. Cardiogenic,
   hypovolemic, or obstructive etiology less likely.
   - No need for bolus at present give pt is normotensive
   - If needed, would bolus with 1L D5 3amps bicarb as resuscitation fluid
   given renal failure metabolic acidosis and maintain MAP>65
   - changed sedation from propofol to Dexmedetomidine to decrease
   hypotension, but weaning sedation nonetheless
   - maintain PIVs, would like to avoid central access if possible given
   need for line holiday given high grade VRE bacteremia
   - broad abx (dapto and zosyn) as below
   - if pressors/central line needed, will discuss placing HD catheter
   with VIP port with renal since likely to need HD
   - If HD needed will need HD catheter placed, will d/w reanl
   # VRE bacteremia: Patient with high grade VRE bacteremia but recent
   blood cx [**2-9**] NGTD and now has had removal of one source of infection
   (basilic vein) as well as PICC. Could also consider endocarditis as
   possibility but TTE negative
   - continue daptomycin per ID recommendations; continue zosyn for broad
   coverage and fever and neutropenia
   - appreciate ID recommendations
   - consider adding linezolid if continues to have positive blood cx or
   increased MIC to dapto
   - consider TEE while intubated but unlikely to currently change
   management, will make sure to discuss with BMT and ID
   # Anuric ARF: Patient with rapidly progressive renal failure last 48
   hours, likely related to ATN from hypotension as well as gentamycin (3
   doses [**Date range (1) 120**]). UOP 275cc last 24 hours, previously 850cc prior 24
   hours. nephrology following and medicatiosn redosed for creatinine
   clearance, may need CVVH next 24-72 hours if remains anuric/oliguric.
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - If hypotensive again, recommend maintaining renal perfusion and
   correct metaboli acidosis with boluses D5 with bicarb
   - renally dose meds, will discuss holding acyclovir with BMT
   # Intubation: Kept intubated overnight for white cell infusion. Patient
   remained post-operatively intubated for unclear reasons. Per
   anesthesia, had tachypnea pre-op but CXR relatively clear and without
   infiltrate other than possible pulmonary edema but difficult to
   interpret in setting of low lung volumes. Oxygen saturations 100% on
   60%.
   - decrease FiO2 to 40% and check ABG
   - change to PSV ventilation
   - short acting sedation to enable probable extubation in am
   - Will wait to make sure no procedures need to be completed before
   extubation, will d/w consulting teams
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: WBC improved from 0.2 to 0.5
   after infusion. Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and clofarabine and
   ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and
   decreased ability to clear infection and bacteremia.
   - Monitor CBC w/diff after granulocyte infusion
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - Touch base with renal and BMT if we should continue ppx with
   voriconazole and acyclovir
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily

   Agree with plan to manage post-op respiratory failure with SBT now and
   potential extubation as her mental status resolves and procedures are
   completed. Continue broad abx coverage for VRE sepsis / febrile
   neutropenia. ARF is progressive, place IR-guided VIP HD line followed
   by HD today. For ALL/AML - NAD on BMBx but pancytopenic s/p granulocyte
   infusion, continue GCSF, RBC transfusion, platelets for procedures.
   Will check smear for TTP/HUS and check MRI if she remains
   encephalopathic post HD. Continue moxifloxacin for +PPD. Remainder of
   plan as outlined above.

   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis now POD #2 s/p excision right basilic [**Hospital 13196**]
   transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension.
   # SEPSIS, high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. Blood cultures still
   turning positive. Fortunately, no blood cultures have turned positive
   since the OR suggesting a possible improvement by the white cell
   transfusion and removing this significant nidus of infection. If
   becomes bacteremic again will consider second white cell infusion
   and/or linezolid as further last-ditch efforts.
   - continue broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zosyn, and
   voriconazole
   - continue surveillance cultures
   - f/u blood cultures, vein path from surgery
   - f/u ID recs
   # ARF, anuric: S/p HD x 1, repeating today per renal. Likely [**2-3**] ATN
   from hypotension vs gent
   - HD this pm pending line placement
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - If hypotensive again, recommend maintaining renal perfusion and
   correct metaboli acidosis with boluses D5 with bicarb
   - holding acyclovir
   # Intubation: Kept intubated for line placement and out of concern for
   mental status although ventilating well.
   - Monitor mental status and will not extubate until mental status
   clears such that pt can protect her airway
   # Acid-Base
   Has normal pH of 7.43 so likely has two primary disorders. Gap
   metabolic acidosis from renal failure. Respiratory alkalosis: maybe
   sepsis, partially compensatory for acidosis.
   - monitor
   # Mental status: Concerning as not on any sedation and BUN not that
   elevated and no improvement after HD x 1.
   - MRI head
   - Bedside EEG
   - Neurology consult, appreciate their input greatly
   - If not improved after second HD, will w/u further, consider LP
   # Hypotension:
   Improved with lifting of sedation
   - monitor
   #) Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: Got another WBC transfusion.
   Patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with
   persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to
   clear infection and bacteremia.
   - Monitor CBC w/diff after granulocyte infusion
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   #) H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room intubated due to transient hypotension.

The patient's current assessment and plan include:

1. Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS): The patient remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation support. The ventilator settings include CPAP/PSV mode, set Vt of 460 mL, PS of 15 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and RSBI of 59.

2. Renal failure, acute (acute renal failure, ARF): The patient is anuric and has been undergoing hemodialysis (HD) once, with plans for repeated HD today pending line placement. The renal team suspects acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension versus gentamicin.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved with the lifting of sedation. Close monitoring is recommended.

4. Mental status: The patient's mental status is concerning as they are not on any sedation and BUN is not significantly elevated. An MRI head"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypotension and remains intubated. He has a history of VRE bacteremia and is currently being treated with antibiotics. The patient is also on dialysis with a VIP port catheter. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-156/46-99 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's blood culture showed Enterococcus species. He has renal failure, acute respiratory failure, hypotension, pancytopenia, and a reduced voltage of precordial leads on ECG.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of intubation, there is an increased risk of developing pneumonia.
2. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The insertion of multiple lines and catheters increases the risk of infection.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's renal function is compromised, which may worsen due to ongoing infection and inadequate perfusion.
4. Enterococcus bacteremia: The presence of Enterococcus species in blood cultures indicates a bacterial infection that needs to be treated effectively to prevent complications such as septic shock.
5. Prolonged sedation and immob"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is experiencing several medical complications. These include bacteremia, acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient's vital signs indicate a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103 to 156/46-99 mmHg, respiratory rate between 19-39 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated at 38°C.

The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode, set tidal volume of 460 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%. The respiratory system compliance is noted to be 30.8 cmH2O/mL.

The patient has a history of morphine allergy and is currently on antibiotics including daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Other medications include pantoprazole, fentanyl, and various ICU medications.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. The platelet count is low (Plt), and there are abnormalities in electrolyte levels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), chloride (Cl-), calcium (Ca++), magnesium (Mg++), and phosphate (PO4).

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.43, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 510, and a respiratory system compliance of 30.8 cmH2O/mL.

Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of renal function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential bleeding due to low platelet count (pancytopenia)."

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of her right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension.

The patient remains somnolent and is tachypneic, bucking on the endotracheal tube. Her heart rate is elevated, and she is hypertensive. An arterial blood gas (ABG) was done, showing a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 21 mmHg, and PaO2 of 204 mmHg. An electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST elevation at 199, with no ischemic changes. The patient has a low-grade fever overnight.

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, nausea/vomiting, and is unable to provide a medical history due to encephalopathy. She was last given antibiotics at 9:00 PM on [date] with daptomycin and at 12:00 AM on [date] with piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

The patient is currently receiving multiple infusions including pantoprazole (Protonix), fentanyl, and other medications such as daptomycin, filgrastim"

","Summary:
- 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia.
- Patient had a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis, which resulted in an emergency surgical procedure to remove the infected line.
- Postoperatively, the patient experienced transient hypotension and was intubated.
- The patient remains somnolent and is experiencing respiratory distress with tachypnea and tachycardia.
- Laboratory results indicate acute renal failure and an altered mental status.
- The patient has a history of biphenotypic leukemia and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade VRE bacteremia, which increases the risk of sepsis. The patient's vital signs indicate tachycardia and hypertension, which may be signs of sepsis.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is somnolent and experiencing jerking movements of the jaw, which could be indicative of seizures or other neurological abnormalities. Further evaluation with imaging studies and a neurology consult is recommended.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's laboratory results show an elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output, suggesting acute renal failure. This could be due to hypotension or exposure to nephrotoxic agents.
4. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged int"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of her right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. The patient remains somnolent and tachypneic, with bucking on the endotracheal tube. She is tachycardic and hypertensive, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.43, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 510, and respiratory alkalosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is somnolent and not following commands, indicating a possible decline in mental function. This could be due to encephalopathy or other neurological issues.
2. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which may lead to sepsis. Continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment are necessary to manage this condition.
3. Acute respiratory failure (ARF): The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She exhibits persistent respiratory alkalosis despite high PaO2 levels. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of ARF, such as pneumonia or acute lung injury.
4. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and persistent neutropenia, admitted with high-grade VRE bacteremia attributed to a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and was intubated in the operating room due to transient hypotension. The patient remains somnolent and has altered mental status, tachypneic, tachycardic, and hypertensive. An MRI was performed this morning, and an ABG showed respiratory alkalosis with high PaO2.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is tachypneic and has jerking movements of the jaw, which could be indicative of seizures. Further investigation is needed with a follow-up MRI and portable EEG.
2. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia and a history of line infection. Continuing antibiotics and surveillance cultures are necessary.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient is anuric and likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin. Hemodialysis (HD) should be continued, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for OR and now has persistently poor mental status. A chest X-ray shows clear lungs, and the ABG indicates respiratory alkalosis. Consider advancing"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a post-operative male who was transferred to the MICU due to hypotension and remains intubated. The patient also has a history of VRE bacteremia. 

The patient has experienced episodes of tachypnea, which resolved by increasing the pressure support ventilation (PSV) to 15 or 20. An advanced endotracheal tube (ETT) by 2cm was attempted. Neurological evaluation including an EEG and lumbar puncture (LP) was recommended, but LP was deferred as it would not change management. MRI and EEG results were negative. C. difficile test was negative.

The patient has a history of allergies to morphine, nausea/vomiting, and last received antibiotics on 02/13 at 9:00 PM. The patient is currently on various infusions and medications including pantoprazole (Protonix), daptomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn).

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 115 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 108/58 mmHg to 125/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's weight is 101.8 kg, with a fluid balance showing an intake of 974 mL and output of 2,207 mL.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room (OR) intubated with transient hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, pancytopenia, and a history of biphenotypic leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure, and there is concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Monitoring for increased secretions, fevers, and performing surveillance cultures is necessary. A chest X-ray has been done, but the final read is pending.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which is likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin use. Continuous hemodialysis (HD) is planned, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided. Renal recommendations are appreciated.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved with lifting of sedation. Monitoring for any further episodes of hypotension is essential.

4. Pancytopenia: The patient has pancytopenia, including neut"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and pancytopenia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room (OR) intubated with transient hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which can lead to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which could potentially progress to ARDS if not managed properly.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, which can be caused by various factors such as hypotension, medications, or sepsis.
4. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may indicate poor perfusion and could lead to organ damage if not corrected promptly.
5. Pancytopenia: The patient's low levels of all blood cell types (pancytopenia) increase the risk of infections, bleeding, and"

   assess for meningitis or meningeal inflammation. However, no brain
   edema is seen to suggest obviously metastatic lesions or abscess.
   Decreased signal is seen within the bony structures which could be
   secondary to patient's leukemia. No mass effect or hydrocephalus.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension, now
   with RF on HD and AMS
   1. Altered mental status:  tachypneic this am with ?jerking movements
   of jaw vs. biting on the tube.  Head CT on [**2-9**] with no acute changes.
   MRI done yesterday; no gado given, but no focal abnormalities seen;
   decreased signal seen within the bony structures which could be
   secondary to patient's leukemia.  Portable [**Month/Day (4) 7960**] (20min) neg for SZ
   activity.  Recurrent episode of biting on the tube ealier today, ?SZ.
   - Appreciate Neuro input; holding off on LP since pt is already on abx
   and neutropenic and thrombocytopenic, so risks high and unclear that
   would change management
   - Will d/w neuro team re: 24 hour [**Month/Day (4) 7960**]
   2. Sepsis: high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. s/p excision of R
   basilica vein on [**2-11**]. Last + blood culture on [**2-11**] pre-OR.
   - continue daptomycin + zosyn
   - f/up surveillance cultures
   - f/u ID recs; will change to linezolid if more recent Cxs turn
   positive
   3. ARF, anuric: likely ATN from hypotension vs gent. HD line placed
   yesterday, got HD yest PM.
   - HD again today
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal input
   - holding acyclovir
   4. Resp failure: intubated for OR, now with persistently poor MS/not
   waking up. CXR with clear lungs.  ABG with high PaO2, persistent
   respiratory alkalosis.
   - advance ETT 2 cm
   - SBT once mental status improves
   5. Acid-Base: normal pH, gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure.
   Respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis, partially compensatory for
   acidosis.
   - monitor
   6. Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2,
   MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia.
   - check ANC daily
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   - review smear re: ?shistocytes
   7. H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily
   as per prior ID recs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU. She has persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of her right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and is currently intubated with transient hypotension.

The patient's current conditions include altered mental status, sepsis, acute renal failure (ARF), respiratory failure, acid-base imbalance, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia. The altered mental status is characterized by tachypnea and jerking movements of the jaw, which may be indicative of seizures. A head CT on [**2-9**] showed no acute changes, and an MRI done yesterday revealed no focal abnormalities but showed decreased signal within the bony structures, which could be secondary to the patient's leukemia.

The patient has a high-grade VRE bacteremia and is being treated with daptomycin and Zosyn. She also has anuric ARF, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin. A hemodialysis (HD) line was placed yesterday, and she received HD last night.

The patient's respiratory status is poor, and she is intubated for OR. Her chest X-ray shows clear"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension, now
   with RF on HD and AMS
   1. Altered mental status:  tachypneic this am with ?jerking movements
   of jaw vs. biting on the tube.  Head CT on [**2-9**] with no acute changes.
   MRI done yesterday; no gado given, but no focal abnormalities seen;
   decreased signal seen within the bony structures which could be
   secondary to patient's leukemia.  Portable [**Month/Day (4) 7960**] (20min) neg for SZ
   activity on prelim report.  Recurrent episode of biting on the tube
   ealier today, ?SZ.
   - Appreciate Neuro input; holding off on LP since pt is already on abx
   and neutropenic and thrombocytopenic, so risks high and unclear that
   would change management
   - Will d/w neuro team re: 24 hour [**Month/Day (4) 7960**], ?EMG
   2. Sepsis: high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. s/p excision of R
   basilica vein on [**2-11**]. Last + blood culture on [**2-11**] pre-OR.
   - continue daptomycin + zosyn
   - f/up surveillance cultures
   - f/u ID recs; will change to linezolid if more recent Cxs turn
   positive
   3. ARF, anuric: likely ATN from hypotension vs gent. HD line placed
   yesterday, got HD yest PM.
   - s/p HD yesterday, next run tomorrow
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal input
   - holding acyclovir
   4. Resp failure: intubated for OR, now with persistently poor MS/not
   waking up. CXR with clear lungs.  ABGs with high PaO2, persistent
   respiratory alkalosis.  Failed SBT today [**2-3**] tachypnea and low VTs,
   which is new from prior; ?myopathy.  Now also with increasing ETT
   secretions.
   - d/w neuro re: ?EMG
   - s/up sputum culture
   - check NIF
   5. Acid-Base: normal pH, gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure.
   Respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis, partially compensatory for
   acidosis.
   - monitor
   6. Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2,
   MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia.
   - check ANC daily

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and is now intubated with transient hypotension. The patient is also experiencing altered mental status, sepsis, acute renal failure (ARF), respiratory failure, acid-base imbalance, and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing intermittent episodes of biting on the endotracheal tube, which could be indicative of seizure activity or delirium.
2. Sepsis: The patient has a high-grade VRE bacteremia and previous line infections, putting her at risk for further sepsis and related complications.
3. ARF: The patient is anuric and likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin use. Close monitoring of renal function and avoidance of nephrotoxic agents are necessary.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient remains intubated and has persistent poor mental status. She also exhibits increasing endotracheal tube secretions, suggesting possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
5. Acid-base imbalance: The patient has a normal pH but shows signs of metabolic acidosis due to renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is admitted to the ICU with bacteremia and acute renal failure.
- The patient has been unresponsive and unable to provide a history.
- The patient has shown tachypnea overnight, with increased peak inspiratory pressure (PS) and decreased respiratory rate (RR).
- The patient has thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 13 from 27, and received a 6-pack of platelets.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), blood pressure ranging from 125/66 to 199/135 mmHg, heart rate of 115 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a CPAP/PSV mode, with a tidal volume (Vt) of 538 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
- The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.49, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 22 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 227 mEq/L, base excess (-3 mEq/L), oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 99%, and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 568.
- The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.5 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) level of 26.8%, platelet count of 13, creatinine (Cr) level of 2.7 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 118 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 0.03.
- The patient's imaging includes a normal MRI with no focal abnormality and no cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis done.
- The patient's assessment includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, and pancytopenia.
- The patient's plan includes ongoing management of respiratory failure, dialysis for renal failure, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, and worsening oxygenation, is necessary.
2. Sepsis: The patient has bacteremia, which means there are bacteria in the bloodstream. Sepsis can develop if the bacteria cause a systemic inflammatory response, leading to organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory values, and clinical symptoms is crucial.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient already has acute renal failure, and AKI can worsen if not appropriately managed. Monitoring kidney function through lab tests and adjusting the treatment plan accordingly is important.
4. Bleeding complications: The patient has thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which increases the risk of bleeding. Any signs of bleeding, such as petechiae or bruising, should be promptly evaluated and managed.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for developing DVT due to immobility and pancytopenia. Prophylaxis measures, such as the use of compression stockings, should be continued, and any signs of D"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and acute renal failure. The patient is unresponsive and on mechanical ventilation. He has a history of morphine allergy, nausea/vomiting, and recent antibiotic use. The patient's vital signs are stable with a sinus tachycardia, but he has been experiencing fluctuations in blood pressure. Fluid balance shows an overall negative balance. The patient is receiving multiple medications and has several lines and catheters in place. Laboratory results indicate acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated cardiac enzymes. The patient is on dialysis and receiving prophylactic medications for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and frequent cultures are necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic anticoagulation should be continued, and periodic lower extremity assessments should be performed.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of corticosteroids can increase the risk of stress ulcers. Proton pump inhibitors should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Renal replacement therapy: The patient's acute renal failure requires ongoing renal replacement therapy. Close monitoring"

   would change management
   - Will d/w neuro team re: 24 hour [**Month/Day (4) 7960**], ?EMG
   2. Sepsis: high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. s/p excision of R
   basilica vein on [**2-11**]. Last + blood culture on [**2-11**] pre-OR.
   - continue daptomycin + zosyn
   - f/up surveillance cultures
   - f/u ID recs; will change to linezolid if more recent Cxs turn
   positive
   3. ARF, anuric: likely ATN from hypotension vs gent. HD line placed
   yesterday, got HD yest PM.
   - s/p HD yesterday, next run tomorrow
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal input
   - holding acyclovir
   4. Resp failure: intubated for OR, now with persistently poor MS/not
   waking up. CXR with clear lungs.  ABGs with high PaO2, persistent
   respiratory alkalosis.  Failed SBT today [**2-3**] tachypnea and low VTs,
   which is new from prior; ?myopathy.  Now also with increasing ETT
   secretions.
   - d/w neuro re: ?EMG
   - s/up sputum culture
   5. Acid-Base: normal pH, gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure.
   Respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis, partially compensatory for
   acidosis.
   - monitor
   6. Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2,
   MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia.
   - check ANC daily
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - f/up with Oncology team re: WBC transfusions
   - continue neupogen

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis. The patient is currently intubated, with altered mental status and recurrent episodes of biting on the tube, which may suggest possible seizures. She has a history of acute respiratory failure, anuric acute kidney injury, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status and intermittent opening of eyes partially to command could indicate a possible central nervous system (CNS) infection or seizures. Further evaluation by the neurology team is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which has been attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. Continuing daptomycin and Zosyn antibiotics is advised, along with follow-up surveillance cultures and consideration of changing to linezolid if recent cultures turn positive.
3. Acute respiratory failure: The patient requires ongoing respiratory support with mechanical ventilation. Her poor mental status and failure of a spontaneous breathing trial suggest potential myopathy or another underlying cause. Consultation with the neurology team and obtaining an electromyography (EMG) to evaluate for myopathy is suggested."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia, admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and is now intubated with transient hypotension. The patient is currently on hemodialysis and in altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing episodes of confusion and possible jerking movements of the jaw, which could be indicative of seizures. Further neurologic evaluation is recommended.
2. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which requires continued treatment with daptomycin and Zosyn. Surveillance cultures should be done, and if recent cultures turn positive, a change to linezolid may be necessary.
3. Acute renal failure (ARF), anuric: The patient likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin exposure. Hemodialysis (HD) was initiated yesterday, and the next run is scheduled for tomorrow. Nephrotoxic agents should be avoided, and renal input is appreciated.
4. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated for the operation and continues to have poor mental status. Clear lungs are seen on chest X-ray, but there is persistent respiratory alkalosis. Failed spontaneous breathing"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She has undergone an excision of the right basilic vein and is currently intubated with transient hypotension.

The patient's altered mental status (AMS) could be due to various causes such as carcinomatous spread, infections (though no growth on recent blood cultures), metabolic factors (patient has had hemodialysis sessions), or seizure activity. An MRI of the head did not reveal any bleeding, edema, metastasis, or meningeal inflammation but showed decreased signaling in the bony structures, possibly indicating leukemia.

The patient has been evaluated by neurology, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) read is planned, along with a 24-hour EEG. She will continue with hemodialysis (HD) and treatment for high-grade bacteremia as outlined below.

The patient also has sepsis and high-grade VRE bacteremia, with no blood cultures turning positive since the operation, suggesting possible improvement by the white cell transfusion and/or removing the significant nidus of infection. If she becomes bacteremic again, consideration will be given to a second white cell infusion and/or linezolid.

   Imaging: MRI Head:
   No gadolinium-enhanced images are obtained to assess for meningitis or

   obviously metastatic lesions or abscess. Decreased signal is seen
   within the bony structures which could be secondary to patient's
   leukemia. No mass effect or hydrocephalus
   CXR:
   The lung volumes are slightly low. with some basilar atelectasis. No
   definite infiltrate. No CHF or effusion. Small (2 mm) nodular density
   overlying the right lung base (right fifth anterior rib) likely
   represents confluence of osseous and vascular shadows.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has altered mental status (AMS). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS: The differential diagnosis for AMS includes infections, metabolic imbalances, carcinomatous spread, and seizure activity. The MRI of the head did not reveal any significant findings, but there is decreased signaling in the bony structures possibly indicative of leukemia. The patient remains intubated and failing spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs). Nerve function tests are low, possibly due to neuromyopathy. Neurology has evaluated the patient, and an EEG read is planned with a 24-hour EEG.

2. Sepsis and high-grade VRE bacteremia: The patient has sepsis and bacteremia caused by VRE. Blood cultures have not turned positive since the OR, suggesting improvement with white cell transfusion and removal of the infected line. If bacteremia recurs, consideration will be given to a second white cell infusion and/or linezolid. Broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zos"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several medical conditions and complications. The patient's chief complaint is an altered mental status, which has been ongoing. The patient also has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and hypotension. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/76 mmHg to 183/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is on CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with a tidal volume of 426 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.

The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 0.8 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 73 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.8 g/dL, and elevated creatinine levels. The blood culture shows the presence of Enterococcus faecium, which is resistant to ampicillin but sensitive to daptomycin.

Imaging studies reveal decreased signal within the bony structures, which could be secondary to the patient's leukemia. No mass effect or hydrocephalus is observed. The chest X-ray shows slightly"

   Imaging: MRI Head:
   No gadolinium-enhanced images are obtained to assess for meningitis or
   meningeal inflammation. However, no brain edema is seen to suggest
   obviously metastatic lesions or abscess. Decreased signal is seen
   within the bony structures which could be secondary to patient's
   leukemia. No mass effect or hydrocephalus
   CXR:
   The lung volumes are slightly low. with some basilar atelectasis. No
   definite infiltrate. No CHF or effusion. Small (2 mm) nodular density
   overlying the right lung base (right fifth anterior rib) likely
   represents confluence of osseous and vascular shadows.

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis.
- She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension.
- The patient now has respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status.
- She has a history of hypotension, renal failure, pancytopenia, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia.
- The patient's condition includes carcinomatous spread, infections, metabolic issues, seizure activity, and neuromyopathy.
- An MRI of the head showed no evidence of bleed, edema, mets, or meningeal inflammation but revealed decreased signaling in the bony structures possibly due to leukemia.
- The patient remains intubated and failing spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs).
- Neurological investigations, including an EEG, have been performed, and a 24-hour EEG is planned.
- The patient continues to receive hemodialysis (HD), treat high-grade bacteremia, and undergoes surveillance cultures.
- She also has acute respiratory failure and requires continued monitoring for increased secretions, fevers, and the possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   Imaging: MRI Head:
   No gadolinium-enhanced images are obtained to assess for meningitis or
   meningeal inflammation. However, no brain edema is seen to suggest
   obviously metastatic lesions or abscess. Decreased signal is seen
   within the bony structures which could be secondary to patient's
   leukemia. No mass effect or hydrocephalus
   CXR:
   The lung volumes are slightly low. with some basilar atelectasis. No
   definite infiltrate. No CHF or effusion. Small (2 mm) nodular density
   overlying the right lung base (right fifth anterior rib) likely
   represents confluence of osseous and vascular shadows.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room (OR) intubated due to transient hypotension. 

The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and has altered mental status (AMS). The differential diagnosis for AMS includes infections, metabolic disturbances, carcinomatous spread, and seizure activity. MRI of the head showed no signs of bleed, edema, metastasis, or meningeal inflammation but did show decreased signaling in the bony structures, possibly indicative of leukemia. 

The patient remains intubated and is failing spontaneous breathing tests (SBTs). She experiences moments of tachypnea and has jerking movements of the jaw, which could be indicative of seizure activity. Neurology has been consulted, and an electroencephalogram (EEG) is planned for further evaluation.

The patient also has sepsis with high-grade VRE bacteremia, for which she is being treated with daptomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). A possible lumbar puncture (LP) is being considered to evaluate cytology/infectious source.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and remains intubated. The patient has a chief complaint of VRE bacteremia. The patient's 24-hour events include blood cultures taken from the HD line at 04:28 AM and 04:55 AM on 02/16/2150. 

The patient's recent medical history shows that oncology did not believe mental status was related to cancer or granulocyte infusion. They ordered a 24-hour EEG and did not feel strongly about performing a lumbar puncture. The renal team was asked to consider the possibility of drugs not cleared by HD. The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and was unable to provide history due to being sedated and unresponsive. 

The patient has allergies to morphine and experiences nausea/vomiting. The last doses of antibiotics given were daptomycin on 02/15/2150 at 07:39 PM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/16/2150 at 12:13 AM.

   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], transferred from OR intubated with transient hypotension, now
   with RF on HD and AMS
   1. Altered mental status:  head CT on [**2-9**] with no acute changes.  MRI
   last week; no gado given, but no focal abnormalities seen; decreased
   signal seen within the bony structures which could be secondary to
   patient's leukemia.  Portable EEG (20min) neg for SZ activity on prelim
   report.  ? of leukemic infiltration of CSF.  On exam, pt is moving ext
   spontaneously today, which is improved from yest.
   - Appreciate Neuro input; holding off on LP since pt is already on abx
   and neutropenic and thrombocytopenic, so risks high and unclear that
   would change management
   - 24 hour EEG today
   2. Sepsis: high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. s/p excision of R
   basilica vein on [**2-11**]. Last + blood culture on [**2-11**] pre-OR.
   - continue daptomycin + zosyn
   - f/up surveillance cultures
   - f/u ID recs; will change to linezolid if more recent Cxs turn
   positive
   3. ARF, anuric: likely ATN from hypotension vs gent. HD line placed
   yesterday, got HD yest PM.
   - s/p HD yesterday, next run tomorrow
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal input
   - holding acyclovir
   4. Resp failure: intubated for OR, now with persistently poor MS/not
   waking up. CXR with clear lungs.  ABGs with high PaO2, persistent
   respiratory alkalosis.  Failed SBT yesterday [**2-3**] tachypnea and low VTs,
   and had low NIFs.  Today, moving extremities.
   - recheck NIF
   - SBT today
   - resend sputum cx
   5. Acid-Base: normal pH, gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure.
   Respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis, partially compensatory for
   acidosis.
   - monitor
   6. Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: patient is s/p hyper CVAD x 2,
   MEC and clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia.
   - check ANC daily
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - f/up with Oncology team re: WBC transfusions

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. 

The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and experiencing altered mental status (AMS). The cause of AMS is uncertain, but it may be related to leukemic infiltration of the central nervous system (CNS) or sepsis. An EEG has been ordered to further evaluate the cause of AMS.

The patient has a history of biphenotypic leukemia and pancytopenia, for which she received hyper CVAD x 2, MEC, clofarabine, and ara-C. This treatment has resulted in persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, making her susceptible to infections.

The patient's respiratory status is critical, with respiratory failure and inability to wean off mechanical ventilation. She has failed spontaneous breathing tests (SBT) due to tachypnea and low tidal volumes, as well as low negative inspiratory forces (NIF). The chest X-ray shows increased pulmonary edema, making it difficult to visualize the endotracheal tube (ETT) and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 36-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), and altered mental status (AMS). He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/76 mmHg to 183/92 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 40%. The patient's blood cultures are negative since February 11th, and he has received multiple antibiotics and antifungal medications. His laboratory results show elevated creatinine, low platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's chest X-ray reveals increased pulmonary edema compared to previous films. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been intubated for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures such as chlorhexidine for oral care and regular assessment of respiratory secretions should be taken.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing DVT. Despite using compression boots, the patient's low platelet count may pose a challenge for using heparin prophylaxis. Alternatives should be considered.
3. Stress ulcers"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's medical history includes renal failure, respiratory failure, and pancytopenia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 113 bpm, blood pressure of 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels and low white blood cell count. The patient's physical examination reveals no significant findings except for the inability to assess peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic status due to the patient being intubated.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, the potential medical complications for this patient may include:
1. Delirium: The patient has altered mental status, which could progress to delirium if not properly managed.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobile and has pancytopenia, increasing the risk of developing DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The patient has a history of renal failure and altered mental status, increasing the risk of stress ulcers.

   1. Altered mental status:  head CT on [**2-9**] with no acute changes.  MRI
   last week; no gado given, but no focal abnormalities seen; decreased
   signal seen within the bony structures which could be secondary to
   patient's leukemia.  Portable EEG (20min) neg for SZ activity on prelim
   report.  ? of leukemic infiltration of CSF.  On exam, pt is moving ext
   spontaneously today, which is improved from yest.
   - Appreciate Neuro input; holding off on LP since pt is already on abx
   and neutropenic and thrombocytopenic, so risks high and unclear that
   would change management

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and is currently intubated with transient hypotension. The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure, acute renal failure (anuric), and altered mental status (AMS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient has AMS with a head CT showing no acute changes and an MRI revealing decreased signal within the bony structures, which could be secondary to the patient's leukemia. The portable EEG did not show any seizure activity, but further evaluation is needed, and a 24-hour EEG is planned. There is a concern about leukemic infiltration of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and a lumbar puncture (LP) is being held off due to the patient's neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

2. Sepsis: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia and underwent excision of the right basilic vein. She is currently on daptomycin and Zosyn antibiotics. Surveillance cultures will be followed up, and if recent cultures turn positive, the antibiotic regimen may be changed to linezolid.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF"

   Patient has been evaluated by neurology.
   - F/u EEG read; plan for 24 hr EEG
   - Continue HD
   - Continue treating high grade bacteremia as outlined below
   - Defer LP at this time given thrombocytopenia
   # SEPSIS, high grade VRE bactermemia [**2-3**] PICC. No blood cultures have
   turned positive since the OR suggesting a possible improvement by the
   white cell transfusion and/or removing this significant nidus of
   infection. If becomes bacteremic again will consider second white cell
   infusion and/or linezolid.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. She now has respiratory failure on mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, and altered mental status.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infections: The patient has a high-grade VRE bacteremia, which needs to be treated promptly to prevent further complications. There is also a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to increased secretions and the need for daily respiratory assessments.

2. Renal failure: The patient is currently on hemodialysis due to acute renal failure. It is crucial to monitor kidney function and avoid nephrotoxic agents to prevent worsening of renal function.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and requires close monitoring of mental status and respiratory parameters to determine the appropriate timing for extubation. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) will be conducted to assess the patient's ability to breathe independently.

4. Acid-base imbalance: The patient has a metabolic acidosis from renal failure and respiratory alkalosis. These imbalances need to be closely monitored and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11 and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. She is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and altered mental status (AMS).

The patient has multiple medical complications including acute respiratory failure, acute renal failure, pancytopenia, and altered mental status. The AMS is improving, but the patient remains intubated due to respiratory failure. The patient's electrolyte abnormalities need to be addressed, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the AMS.

The patient's high-grade VRE bacteremia is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Surveillance cultures are being monitored, and if bacteremia recurs, consideration will be given to a second white cell infusion and/or linezolid.

The patient's anuria likely indicates acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension versus gentamicin. Renal recommendations should be appreciated, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided.

The patient is at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and daily respiratory secretions and cultures are important. The patient's mental status needs to be closely monitored before extubation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and is experiencing altered mental status (AMS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Daily spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs) will be conducted to assess the possibility of extubation. Monitoring for increased secretions, fever, and respiratory distress is crucial.
2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to septic shock or gentamicin toxicity. Avoiding nephrotoxic agents and continuing hemodialysis sessions are recommended.
3. Sepsis and High-Grade VRE Bacteremia: The patient has a history of sepsis and high-grade VRE bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are being administered, and surveillance cultures are being monitored. If the patient becomes bacteremic again, a second white cell infusion and/or linezolid may be considered.
4. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient has a metabolic acidosis from renal failure and respiratory alkalosis. Monitoring and correcting electrolyte abnormalities are necessary"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and was transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension. Currently, she is on hemodialysis (HD) and has altered mental status (AMS). 

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's mental status is improving but remains a concern. It could be due to various causes such as carcinomatous spread, infections (though no growth on recent blood culture), metabolic abnormalities, or seizure activity. An MRI of the head showed decreased signaling in bony structures possibly related to [2-3] leukemia. Neurology evaluation has been done, and electrolyte abnormalities are being corrected. An EEG has been ordered, and a 24-hour EEG is planned.
2. Sepsis and High-Grade VRE Bacteremia: The patient has a history of sepsis and high-grade VRE bacteremia. She had a PICC line in place, and no blood cultures have turned positive since the OR, suggesting a possible improvement from the white cell transfusion and removal of the significant nidus of infection. If she becomes bacteremic again, a second white cell infusion and/or line"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11, transferred from the operating room intubated with transient hypotension, now with respiratory failure on hemodialysis (HD) and altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is showing signs of improvement in her mental status, but it is important to continue monitoring her neurological function. An EEG has been planned, and a 24-hour EEG will be performed to rule out seizures or other neurological causes.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains intubated due to failed spontaneous breathing trials and concerns about protecting her airway. There is an elevated bicarbonate level, which could indicate respiratory alkalosis. Daily respiratory muscle strength testing, secretion monitoring, and sputum cultures are recommended.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension or gentamicin therapy. Avoidance of nephrotoxic agents and appreciation of renal recommendations are advised. Hemodialysis sessions will be continued.

4. High-Grade VRE Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which requires ongoing treatment with daptomycin and p"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a post-operative individual who was admitted to the ICU due to hypotension and remains intubated. They have a history of VRE bacteremia and are currently on multiple antibiotics including daptomycin, voriconazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient's temperature has been elevated, and they are experiencing encephalopathy, which is causing difficulty in providing a medical history. 

The patient's vital signs show a sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 107 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 138/88 mmHg to 106/61 mmHg. Respiratory support is being provided through an endotracheal tube with mechanical ventilation. 

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,464 mL and an output of 3,096 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 632 mL. 

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count ranging from 0.5 to 0.4 K/uL. The hemoglobin level is 8.3 g/dL, sodium is 141 mg/dL, potassium is 3.1 mg/dL, and creatinine is 3.3 mg/dL. 

Radiology findings reveal no acute pneumonia in the chest X-ray.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia, currently admitted to the ICU for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein and is now intubated with transient hypotension. She is experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and requires hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.6°F, heart rate of 102 bpm, blood pressure of 142/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 34 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 17 mEq/L.

Laboratory results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 0.5 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 8.3 g/dL, and thromb"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. He is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient's history is significant for encephalopathy, and he has multiple comorbidities including acute renal failure, acute leukemia (biphenotypic), and a history of malignancy. The patient's current medications include propofol, pantoprazole, and fentanyl. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, as indicated by low urine output and elevated creatinine levels. This could lead to further complications such as electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
3. Acute Leukemia: The patient has acute leukemia, which may require specific treatment interventions. Complications could arise if the leukemia progresses or if the patient develops treatment-related side effects.
4. Malignancy: The patient's history of malignancy increases the risk of complications related to cancer progression or recurrence.
5. Encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status could be due to encephalopathy. There is a risk of delirium or worsening cognitive function if not managed appropriately.
6. Infections: The presence of fever and positive fungal"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia, admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and was intubated due to transient hypotension. The patient is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and altered mental status (AMS).

Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is currently intubated. She has altered mental status, making it unsafe to extubate her until her mental status improves.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure (ARF), likely due to hypotension or gentamicin use. She is currently on HD and will have another session on Wednesday.

3. Sepsis and High-Grade VRE Bacteremia: The patient has high-grade VRE bacteremia, which is being treated with daptomycin and Piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The source of infection is suspected to be a line infection, and the patient has undergone an excision of the infected line.

4. Leukemia: The patient has biphenotypic leukemia, which is not responding well to chemotherapy. She continues to have persistent neutropenia"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU. The patient has several medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated due to line placement and has failed spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) given altered mental status (AMS). The patient also has increased secretions, and sputum culture pending. The patient continues to have centrally driven tachypnea and mental status not at baseline, which is limiting extubation.

2. Altered mental status (AMS): The patient is agitated and requires some sedation. Differential diagnosis includes carcinomatous spread, infections (though no growth on recent blood culture), metabolic causes (patient s/p HD sessions), and seizure activity. A 20-minute EEG was negative, and an MRI of the head was non-revealing for bleed/edema/mets/meningeal inflammation but showed decreased signaling in bony structures possibly related to leukemia.

3. Renal failure, acute (ARF): The patient is anuric and has undergone hemodialysis (HD). The cause of ARF is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension versus gentamicin. The patient should avoid nephrotoxic agents and appreciate renal recommendations. HD should be continued.

4. VRE bacteremia: The patient had a high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)"

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She was transferred from the operating room (OR) intubated due to transient hypotension and is currently on hemodialysis (HD) and alert mental status (AMS).

The patient's current medical conditions include respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. The respiratory failure is attributed to intubation for line placement and subsequent failure of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to altered mental status. The acute renal failure is likely due to hypotension or gentamicin toxicity. The altered mental status is likely caused by sepsis, metabolic factors, or seizure activity.

The patient's lab results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The imaging studies reveal decreased signaling in bony structures possibly related to leukemia.

The patient's treatment plan includes monitoring electrolytes, repeating EEG, continuing HD, treating high-grade bacteremia with appropriate antibiotics, considering use of antipsychotics to lessen sedation needs, avoiding nephrotoxic agents, and monitoring for increased secretions and fevers.

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated"

   Assessment and Plan
   Active issues include
   #  Altered mental status:  unclear etiology, developed while on antbx
   and after intubation, unremarkable work-up to date (including head CT,
   MRI, and portable EEG), onc team feels unlikely to be CNS involvement
   of malignancy
        MS now seems to be slowly improving, but still waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**]
         Suspect is [**2-3**] toxic metabolic process / underlying delirium, and
   possibly sz/post-ictal state
   -- will hold on LP at this time given risks from procedure in setting
   of neutropenic and thrombocytopenic, and given broad antbx
   --continue serial neuro exams
   --repeat EEG, and if abnl will readdress possible LP
   -- trial of haldol since agitated delirium likely contributing
   # Resp failure: agitation and AMS are primary barriers to extubation as
   well as high MV and persistent alkalosis
   - she has a mixed resp and met alkalosis, with high central drive to
   breath
   --continue current PSV, given her high MV (rates in 30-40 range
   regardless of PS or vent changes with TVs .400)  we are hesitant to
   extubate, pt has severe thrombocytopenia and already with bloody ET
   sx.  We will continue to reassess for extubation as MS and hopefully
   central drive/alkalosis improves.
   # VRE bacteremia , has cleared
   - continue daptomycin + zosyn
   - Id following, with plan to change to linezolid if repeat cxs turn
   positive
    # ARF: anuric, likely ATN from hypotension vs gent toxicity
   -- HD per schedule
   --avoid nephrotoxic agents, renally dose meds, holding acyclovir
   # Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: s/p hyper CVAD x 2, MEC and
   clofarabine and ara-C, now with persistent neutropenia and
   thrombocytopenia and decreased ability to clear infection and
   bacteremia.
   - maintain active type and scan, transfuse for platelets <10,000/signs
   of bleeding and HCT<24
   - daily ANC

   Addendum
   After rounds, pt more alert and able to follow simple commands, nodding
   appropriately to questions. MS remains confusing. Given this waxing and
   [**Doctor Last Name 533**] pattern, I am concerned for possibility of szs and post-ictal

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein due to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. Postoperatively, she experienced transient hypotension and was intubated.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status (AMS), respiratory failure, acute kidney injury (ARF), and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia. AMS is attributed to unclear etiology, possibly toxic metabolic process, underlying delirium, or seizures. Respiratory failure is due to agitation, AMS, high minute ventilation (MV), and persistent metabolic alkalosis. VRE bacteremia has cleared, but the patient remains on daptomycin and Zosyn. ARF is anuric, likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension versus gentamicin toxicity. The patient is currently undergoing hemodialysis (HD) per schedule and avoiding nephrotoxic agents. Biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia is being managed with hyper CVAD x 2, MEC, clofarabine, and ara-C. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg,"

   malignancy
   MS is slowly omproving and suspect is [**2-3**] toxic metabolic process /
   underlying delirium,
   -- will hold on LP at this time given risks from procedure, and on

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient remains critically ill, with ongoing respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
- The patient's mental status is altered but has slowly improved, and a toxic metabolic process or underlying delirium is suspected.
- A lumbar puncture was considered but held due to risks associated with the procedure and the patient's thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.
- The patient has Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia and is receiving appropriate antibiotics.
- Acute renal failure (ARF) is present, and the patient is anuric, likely due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin toxicity.
- The patient has biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia and is undergoing chemotherapy, leading to persistent neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
- The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and a slightly elevated temperature.
- Fluid balance is negative, indicating ongoing fluid losses.
- Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests.
- The patient has a positive PPD and is on prophylactic antibiotics.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. If the underlying cause is not addressed, there is a risk of continued respiratory failure and potential"

   Microbiology: no new culture growth
   sputum with GPCs, culture pending.
   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], bacteremia resolved but still intubated [**2-3**] AMS.
   1. Respiratory failure:
   Seems less agitated today. Has done well on MMV. Mental status
   improved. Still tachypnic. GPCs in sputum gram stain, culture pending.
   - consider extubation if mental status continues to clear (would likely
   need platelet transfusion)
   - if still unable to extubate will have to adress trach soon
   - f/u sputum culture
   -  Daily RISBI, SBTs and NIFs
   - Monitor for increased secretions, fevers
   - VAP PPX
   2. AMS:
   Overall still improving. Etiology still a mystery. Seems like delerium
   more than seizure. And with carcinomatosis, would expect it to
   gradually get worse, also timing of onset not c/w cancer or infection.
   Had additional EEG today.
   - appreciate neuro input on etiology and recs
   - f/u EEG read
   - continue to monitor
   - continue haldol if working though a bit unclear
   - if no seizure activity or normal EEG and still not improving will
   consider LP
   - Continue HD
   3. Conjugated hyperblirubinemia
   Likely [**2-3**] sepsis, chronic illness but ddx includes biliary
   obstruction, drug effect. INR also trending up but this may be [**2-3**] poor
   nutrition. RUQ ultrasound negative for biliary ductal dilatation.
   - trend
   - f/u final US read
   - consider repeat imaging if worsening
   4.  ARF
   Still  basically anuric: HD yesterday. Likely [**2-3**] ATN from hypotension
   vs gent
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - holding acyclovir
   - continue HD
   5.  Acid-Base:
   Gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure. Also with primary
   respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis or CNS disease, PE on differential,
   partially compensatory for acidosis.
   - monitor vitals and VBGs
   6.  VRE bactermemia
   [**2-3**] PICC. No blood cultures have turned positive since the OR
   - Continue broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zosyn
   - f/u peniding cultures
   - appreciate ID recs regarding length of treatment
   7. Epistaxis
   [**2-3**] low platelets
   - afrin
   - transfuse platelets
   8.  Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia:
   - Platelets today given platelets 5
   - Daily ANC
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   9. H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily
   as per prior ID recs for prophylaxis of reactivation

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia, admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11], and her bacteremia has resolved. However, she remains intubated due to altered mental status (AMS).

1. Respiratory failure:
The patient's respiratory status seems to have improved, as she is less agitated and doing well on mandatory minute volume (MMV). Her mental status has also improved. She is still tachypneic, and gram-positive cocci (GPCs) have been found in her sputum gram stain, with culture pending. The plan is to consider extubation if her mental status continues to clear and if she has received a platelet transfusion. If extubation is not possible, tracheostomy may be necessary. Daily respiratory rate index (RISBI), spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), and noninvasive ventilation (NIF) assessments should be conducted. Monitoring for increased secretions, fevers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prophylaxis should continue.

2. Altered mental status:
The patient's overall mental status is improving. The etiology of AMS remains unclear, with seizures being considered but unlikely. Additional electroencephalogram (EEG)"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and persistent neutropenia, who was admitted with high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and was intubated with transient hypotension.
- The patient experienced several events during her 24-hour stay in the ICU, including agitation and delirium that required haloperidol and propofol, bleeding from the right nostril that was resolved with platelet transfusion, and an ongoing EEG result pending.
- The patient's allergies include morphine, nausea/vomiting, and she has a history of positive PPD. Her last doses of antibiotics were daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and voriconazole.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.4°C (99.3°F), current temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate 112 bpm with a range of 92-118 bpm, blood pressure 143/77 mmHg with a range of 92/53-200/143 mmHg, respiratory rate 33 breaths per minute with a range of 28-41 breaths per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 50-year-old female with a history of biphenotypic leukemia and pancytopenia, who presented with altered mental status, respiratory failure, and multi-organ dysfunction. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The patient has had several complications including delirium, VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure, and thrombocytopenia. She is being treated with multiple antibiotics and supportive measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and intermittent agitation may indicate delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as infection, medication side effects, or underlying medical conditions.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, with persistent alkalosis and a high MV (minute ventilation). There is a concern for extubation failure due to agitation and altered mental status.
3. VRE Bacteremia: The patient has cleared the initial VRE bacteremia but remains at risk for further infections due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is anuric and likely has acute tubular necrosis (ATN) from hypotension or gentamicin toxicity. Active management of renal function with hemodialysis is required.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding. Prophylactic platelet transf"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of recent post-operative hypotension and remains intubated in the MICU. The patient also has a chief complaint of VRE bacteremia. The patient successfully extubated and has been weaned from 100% FiO2 to 35%. There were no seizures on EEG but not finalized on OMR. The ID recommended continuing with the current regimen, with an extended course once counts recover. They also advised watching LFTs and considering stopping voriconazole if bilirubin climbs. The US abdomen showed a diffusely echogenic liver without focal lesions, compatible with diffuse fatty infiltrates. Other forms of liver disease or advanced liver disease such as fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded. There is no hydroureteronephrosis in either kidney. LFTs are elevated with t bilirubin 2.3, d bilirubin 1.9, and gtt 400. Heme/onc would like another transplant, but it depends on renal status, whether the patient is dialysis dependent. The patient spiked a fever overnight at 101s and got pan-cultured. The patient is unable to provide history due to encephalopathy. The patient has allergies to morphine, nausea/vomiting, and last dose of antibiotics was voriconazole on 02/19/20 at 07:57 AM, daptomycin on 02/19/20 at 09:00 PM, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/20/20 at 12:29 AM. The patient is currently on pantoprazole (Protonix) and other ICU medications. The patient's weight is 101 kg (admission): 105.5 kg. Fluid balance shows a total in of 1,973 mL and total out of 1,898 mL with a positive balance of -63 mL. Respiratory support includes O2 delivery device face tent, ventilator mode PSV/SBT, set Vt 400 mL, PS 8 cmH2O, RR set 8, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 35%, PIP 13 cmH2O, SpO2 97%, and ABG ///17/. Physical examination shows peripheral vascular issues, skin not assessed, and neurologic issues not assessed. Lab results include WBC 0.4, Hct 26.2, Plt 23, Cr 3.3, Glucose 197, and other abnormal values. Microbiology results are pending for blood culture, urine culture, sputum gram stain, respiratory culture, and fungal culture. The patient's assessment and plan include thrombocytopenia, acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, epistaxis, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and leukemia."

   Biphenotypic
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], bacteremia resolved but still intubated [**2-3**] AMS.
   1. Respiratory failure: Weaning down O2, improving, however mental
   status worse and still tachypneic. CXR unremarkable.
   - Check ABG
   - consider intubation if respiratory status worsens
   - f/u sputum culture
   2. AMS: Worse today. Cultures pending.
   - appreciate neuro input on etiology and recs
   - f/u EEG read
   - continue to monitor
   - if no seizure activity or normal EEG and still not improving will
   consider LP
   - Continue HD
   3. Conjugated hyperblirubinemia. Worsening.
   - Stop vori per ID
   Likely [**2-3**] sepsis, chronic illness but ddx includes biliary
   obstruction, drug effect. INR also trending up but this may be [**2-3**] poor
   nutrition. RUQ ultrasound negative for biliary ductal dilatation.
   - trend
   - f/u final US read
   - consider repeat imaging if worsening
   4.  ARF
 per renal unclear if this is long term or not.
   Still  basically anuric: HD yesterday. Likely [**2-3**] ATN from hypotension
   vs gent
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - holding acyclovir
   - continue HD
   5.  Acid-Base:
   Gap metabolic acidosis from renal failure. Also with primary
   respiratory alkalosis: maybe sepsis or CNS disease, PE on differential,
   partially compensatory for acidosis.
   - monitor vitals and VBGs
   6.  VRE bactermemia
   [**2-3**] PICC. No blood cultures have turned positive since the OR
   - Continue broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zosyn
   - f/u peniding cultures
   - appreciate ID recs regarding length of treatment
   7. Epistaxis
   [**2-3**] low platelets
   - afrin
   - transfuse platelets
   8.  Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia: BMT to consider another
   transplant.
   - Platelets today given platelets 5
   - Daily ANC
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   9. H/O positive PPD: continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin 400mg daily
   as per prior ID recs for prophylaxis of reactivation

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU for persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 02/11 and her bacteremia resolved, but she remains intubated with altered mental status since 02/03. 

The patient's current health issues include respiratory failure, altered mental status, epistaxis, renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and leukemia. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and her respiratory status is improving, but her mental status has worsened. Her CXR is unremarkable, and she needs to be monitored closely with ABG checks. If her respiratory status worsens, intubation may be necessary. 

Her altered mental status has not improved, and cultures are pending. She requires neurologic input for further evaluation and recommendations. An EEG read is also pending, and she should continue to be monitored. If there is no seizure activity or normal EEG and her mental status does not improve, a lumbar puncture may be considered. 

Her conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is worsening, and her INR is trending up. This may be due to poor nutrition or biliary obstruction. The RUQ ultrasound is negative for biliary ductal dilatation. She should be trended, and final US read should be obtained. Repeat imaging may be necessary"

The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, along with septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was intubated due to prolonged respiratory failure caused by acute myeloid syndrome (AMS). The patient is now extubated and experiencing delirium, acute renal failure on hemodialysis, and a new fever. Her vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, blood pressure ranging from 127/65 to 142/79 mmHg, heart rate between 95-118 bpm, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent.

24-hour events include blood cultures and urine cultures drawn, fever at 101.1°F, and the patient being extubated yesterday. Her last doses of antibiotics were Voriconazole on 02/19/20 at 07:57 AM, Daptomycin on 02/19/20 at 09:00 PM, and Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/20/20 at 08:00 AM.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. They were extubated yesterday and have been experiencing fever, increased liver function tests (LFTs), and a positive blood culture. The patient has a history of biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia, and they have undergone chemotherapy treatments. They also have a positive PPD test and require ongoing oncology recommendations. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with a temperature of 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 108 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 142/79 to 162/84 mmHg, respiratory rate of 33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97%. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.5 kg at admission to 101 kg currently. They have edema in both lower extremities and follow simple commands but are not assessed for movement, tone, or assessed pulses. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows no focal process on the chest X-ray, and microbiology cultures are pending. The patient's assessment includes altered mental status, acid-base status, fever, VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure, and fatty liver. The plan includes monitoring neuro exam, avoiding sedating medications, rechecking labs, sending lactate, and adding empiric flagyl. The patient is on dialysis per schedule and will continue with current"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who has been admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, along with septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein and was transferred from the operating room intubated due to prolonged respiratory failure caused by acute myeloid syndrome (AMS). The patient was extubated yesterday, is now delirious, and has acute renal failure on hemodialysis (HD) with a new fever.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1°F, heart rate between 95-118 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/65-162/84 mmHg, respiratory rate between 9-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a face tent. The patient's weight is currently 101 kg, with a total fluid intake of 1,973 mL and output of 75 mL. The patient is receiving various medications, including pantoprazole (Protonix), daptomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and others.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 0.2 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 8.1 g/dL, platelet count of 37 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 54 mg/dL, creatinine (Cr) of 3.9 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 140 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 4.0 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 102 mEq/L, bicarbonate (HCO3-) of 22.9%, and magnesium (Mg++) of 1.8 mg/dL. The patient also has elevated liver enzymes and lactate levels.

Imaging reveals no focal process on chest X-ray, and microbiology results are pending. The patient's assessment and plan include several conditions, including fever, delirium, altered mental status, acid-base status, VRE bacteremia, acute renal failure, liver function abnormalities, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:
1. Nosocomial infection: Given the patient's prolonged hospital stay, immunocompromised state, and multiple potential sources for infection, there is a high concern for a nosocomial infection. The patient is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but additional measures may be necessary.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status and somnolence suggest delirium. This can be multifactorial, potentially due to metabolic disturbances, infection, or uremia. Monitoring the neurologic exam and avoiding sedating medications is recommended.
3. Acid-base status: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a post-operative patient who was transferred to the MICU due to hypotension. They remain intubated and have been experiencing fever. The patient's mental status is altered, making it difficult for them to take oral medications. They have a history of VRE bacteremia and continue to be monitored closely.

24-hour events include blood cultures, urine culture, and fever. The patient's respiratory support has been weaned from 100% to 35% FiO2. Neuro assessment shows no seizures on EEG. The patient's liver function tests are abnormal with elevated bilirubin levels. An ultrasound of the abdomen reveals diffuse echogenic liver without focal lesions, indicating fatty infiltrates. Kidney function is also impaired, and there is a discussion about the possibility of another transplant. The patient is allergic to morphine and has nausea/vomiting.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 101.1 F (38.4 C), heart rate 107-118 bpm, blood pressure 117/87 mmHg, respiratory rate 29-42 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on face tent. The patient is lethargic but moving all extremities, with eyes opening to tactile stimulation. There is no rash or meningismus. Chest auscultation reveals bilateral clear lung sounds. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is mild extremity edema.

Lab results show leukopenia with"

   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], bacteremia resolved but still intubated [**2-3**] AMS.
   * With new fevers, worsening coaggulopathy, worsening LFTs, and
   worsening gap is concerning for new infection.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt has been weaned down successfully since extubation.
   Still tachypneic. GPCs in sputum gram stain, culture pending.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - continue to wean down O2
   - CXR
   2. AMS: More lethargic today than yesterday, most likely secondary to
   fever exacerbating slowly recovering toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
   However still following commands and opening eyes.
   - appreciate neuro input on etiology and recs
   - check ABG
   - F/u recent sputum, blood, urine cx drawn this AM for fever
   - Check C diff
   - Start metronidazole for emperic treatment of c diff
   - f/u final EEG read
   - continue to monitor
   - if no seizure activity or normal EEG and still not improving will
   consider LP
   - Continue HD
   3. Conjugated hyperblirubinemia
   Likely [**2-3**] to drug affect, consider voriconazole. INR also trending up
   but this may be [**2-3**] poor nutrition. RUQ ultrasound negative for biliary
   ductal dilatation.
   - stop voriconazole (per ID not clear what this is treating)
   - trend
   - consider repeat imaging if worsening
   # Coagulopathy: INR rising from 1.2 to 1.3, to 1.4, to 1.5 today.
   Concerning for return of sepsis/DIC in light of fevers.
   - Check DIC labs
   - Monitor
   4.  ARF
   Still  anuric: HD today. Renal thinks this will probably be permenant
   but not impossible for her function to return. Likely [**2-3**] ATN from
   hypotension vs gent
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - holding acyclovir
   - continue HD
   5.  Acid-Base: Gap severely increased today. Gap metabolic acidosis
   from renal failure. Also with primary respiratory alkalosis: maybe
   sepsis or CNS disease, PE on differential, partially compensatory for
   acidosis. Lactate 2.3.
   - Recheckl lytes and VBGs tonight
   6.  VRE bactermemia
   [**2-3**] PICC. No blood cultures have turned positive since the OR

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11], and the bacteremia resolved but remained intubated since [2-3] with altered mental status.

Current issues:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has been successfully weaned down since extubation but still has tachypnea. Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) were found in the sputum gram stain, and the culture is pending. Follow-up sputum culture is needed, along with continued weaning of oxygen and a chest X-ray.
2. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient is more lethargic today than yesterday, likely secondary to fever exacerbating slowly recovering toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. However, the patient is still following commands and opening eyes. Appreciate neuro input on etiology and recommendations. Check arterial blood gas (ABG), follow up recent sputum, blood, and urine cultures drawn this morning for fever, check C. difficile, start metronidazole for empirical treatment of C. difficile, follow up final electroencephalogram (EEG) read, continue monitoring, consider lumbar puncture (LP) if no seizure activity or normal EEG and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 24-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of sepsis. The patient has a history of multiple infections and is currently on several antibiotics. He is experiencing fevers, worsening coagulopathy, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's platelet count is low, and he has renal failure. The patient's mental status is altered but not due to delirium. The patient has a history of malignancy and is currently being treated for acute leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition suggests sepsis due to the presence of fevers, worsening coagulopathy, and liver function abnormalities.
2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's coagulation profile indicates a risk for DIC, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by abnormal blood clotting.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated serum creatinine levels and reduced urine output indicate possible AKI, which can further complicate the patient's condition.
4. Infection: The patient's history of multiple infections and ongoing fevers suggest a risk of new infections or complications related to existing infections.
5. Hepatic Encephalopathy: Given the patient's altered mental status and liver dysfunction, there is a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by severe liver disease.
6. Bleeding: The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11 and delayed extubation due to altered mental status, eventually being extubated on 2/18 but still experiencing AMS. The patient has several medical complications, including aspiration pneumonia, coagulopathy, conjunctival pale appearance, edema in the lower extremities, and respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient's recent extubation and altered mental status put her at risk for aspiration, which has been confirmed by imaging findings showing an ill-defined opacity in the left mid lung zone.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is increasing, indicating a potential for bleeding or clotting disorders. This could be related to sepsis, DIC, or other factors.
3. Conjunctival pale appearance: The patient's pale conjunctiva may indicate anemia or other blood-related issues, which could be related to her leukemia or other underlying conditions.
4. Edema in lower extremities: The presence of edema in both lower extremities could suggest fluid overload or heart failure.
5. Respiratory distress: The patient's low oxygen saturation and abnormal ABG results indicate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and pancytopenia admitted to the ICU. She has a history of persistent neutropenia, high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and delayed extubation due to altered mental status. She was eventually extubated on [2-18] but remains with altered mental status. The patient's current conditions include opacity on chest X-ray, fevers, low-grade; altered mental status; acid-base abnormalities; renal failure; VRE bacteremia; epistaxis; and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's low-grade fevers and elevated white blood cell count with toxic granulation suggest a possible infection. It is essential to monitor for any signs of worsening infection and perform appropriate cultures.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of an ill-defined area of patchy opacification in the left mid lung zone on the chest X-ray raises concern for pneumonia. Further evaluation and follow-up imaging are necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
3. Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease: The patient's altered mental status and primary respiratory alkalosis may indicate CNS involvement, such as a possible stroke or encephalitis. Monitoring of neurologic symptoms and imaging studies may be required to assess the CNS.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient has received prophylactic measures against DVT, her low platelet count increases the risk for thrombosis. Regular monitoring for signs of DVT is crucial.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's anuria and ongoing requirement for hemodialysis suggest permanent or temporary renal failure. It is important to avoid nephrotoxic agents and closely follow renal recommendations.
6. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient exhibits metabolic acidosis from renal failure and lactate, as well as primary respiratory alkalosis. Close monitoring of electrolytes and arterial blood gases (VBGs) is necessary.
7. VRE Bacteremia: The patient continues to be treated for VRE bacteremia. Broad-spectrum antibiotics with daptomycin and Zosyn are being administered, and pending cultures should be followed up.
8. Epistaxis: The patient experienced an episode of nosebleed, which may be related to her low platelet count. Close monitoring and treatment with antihemorrhagic agents and platelet transfusion as needed are recommended.
9. Biphenotypic Leukemia/Pancytopenia: The patient's leukemia/pancytopenia requires ongoing monitoring of daily absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet counts, and hematocrit levels. Transfusion and growth factors"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 year old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent
   neutropenia and high grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection
   and septic thrombophlebitis, now s/p excision right basilic vein on
   [**2-11**], bacteremia resolved but still intubated [**2-3**] AMS.
   * With new fevers, worsening coaggulopathy, worsening LFTs, and
   worsening gap is concerning for new infection.
   1. Hypoxia: Pt has been weaned down successfully since extubation.
   Still tachypneic. GPCs in sputum gram stain, culture pending.
   - f/u sputum culture
   - continue to wean down O2
   - CXR
   2. AMS: More lethargic today than yesterday, most likely secondary to
   fever exacerbating slowly recovering toxic-metabolic encephalopathy.
   However still following commands and opening eyes.
   - appreciate neuro input on etiology and recs
   - check ABG
   - F/u recent sputum, blood, urine cx drawn this AM for fever
   - Check C diff
   - Start metronidazole for emperic treatment of c diff
   - f/u final EEG read
   - continue to monitor
   - if no seizure activity or normal EEG and still not improving will
   consider LP
   - Continue HD
   3. Conjugated hyperblirubinemia
   Likely [**2-3**] to drug affect, consider voriconazole. INR also trending up
   but this may be [**2-3**] poor nutrition. RUQ ultrasound negative for biliary
   ductal dilatation.
   - stop voriconazole (per ID not clear what this is treating)
   - trend
   - consider repeat imaging if worsening
   # Coagulopathy: INR rising from 1.2 to 1.3, to 1.4, to 1.5 today.
   Concerning for return of sepsis/DIC in light of fevers.
   - Check DIC labs
   - Monitor
   4.  ARF
   Still  anuric: HD today. Renal thinks this will probably be permenant
   but not impossible for her function to return. Likely [**2-3**] ATN from
   hypotension vs gent
   - avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - appreciate renal recommendations
   - holding acyclovir
   - continue HD
   5.  Acid-Base: Gap severely increased today. Gap metabolic acidosis
   from renal failure. Also with primary respiratory alkalosis: maybe
   sepsis or CNS disease, PE on differential, partially compensatory for
   acidosis. Lactate 2.3.
   - Recheckl lytes and VBGs tonight
   6.  VRE bactermemia
   [**2-3**] PICC. No blood cultures have turned positive since the OR
   - Continue broad coverage antibiotics with daptomycin, zosyn
   - f/u peniding cultures
   - appreciate ID recs regarding length of treatment
   7. Epistaxis- improved
   [**2-3**] low platelets
   - afrin
   - transfuse platelets
   8.  Biphenotypic Leukemia/pancytopenia:
   - Platelets today given platelets 5
   - Daily ANC
   - maintain an active type and screen
   - transfuse for platelets<10,000 or any signs of bleeding and HCT<24
   - continue neupogen
   9. H/O positive PPD: cannot continue prior regimen of moxifloxacin

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11 and subsequently resolved the bacteremia but remains intubated in the ICU since 2/3.

The patient is currently experiencing new fevers, worsening coagulopathy, worsening liver function tests (LFTs), and worsening gap, which is concerning for a new infection. The patient also has hypoxia, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and leukemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Sepsis: The patient's new fevers, worsening coagulopathy, and worsening LFTs are concerning for a new infection, which can lead to sepsis. The patient is already at risk due to her immunocompromised state from the leukemia and previous bacteremia.

2. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's INR is rising, indicating worsening coagulopathy. DIC is a potential complication of sepsis and can lead to widespread bleeding or clotting.

3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's hypoxia and tachypnea"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia, admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She also has acute renal failure and underwent an operation for the excision of her right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis. The patient is currently in the ICU and is critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of high-grade VRE bacteremia, which can lead to further complications if not effectively treated. There is also a concern about recurrent fevers, indicating a possible ongoing infection.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing anuria (lack of urine production), suggesting acute renal failure. This condition requires prompt management, including dialysis as needed.
3. Leukemia: The patient has biphenotypic leukemia, and her bone marrow is showing signs of recovery. However, this condition can still lead to complications related to low blood cell counts, such as infections and bleeding.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient is exhibiting altered mental status, which could be attributed to various factors, including the underlying medical conditions, medications, or complications like electrolyte imbalances.

The patient also has anuric acute renal failure (ARF) following aspiration myocardial infarction (AMS) and prolonged respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include recurrent fevers. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics including voriconazole, daptomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She is currently receiving pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of ICU medications.

Vital signs as of 2/21/2150 at 11:58 AM show a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 157/83 to 164/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on a face tent.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, coarse breath sounds without wheezes, 1+ edema in the right upper extremity surgical incisions, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurologic examination shows the patient follows simple commands, minimally arousable, but no further assessment of movement, tone, or mental status is performed.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and delayed extubation due to altered mental status, eventually extubated on [**2-18**] but still experiencing altered mental status.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise from her current condition:

1. Liver function abnormalities: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and an echogenic liver on ultrasound, indicating possible liver dysfunction. This could be due to sepsis, coagulopathy, or underlying liver disease.

2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, indicating a risk of bleeding. This may be related to her leukemia, sepsis, or other factors.

3. Metabolic acidosis: The patient has a low bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic acidosis. This could be due to poor tissue perfusion, sepsis, or other causes.

4. Respiratory alkalosis: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, which may be compensatory for metabolic acidosis or due to pain or anxiety.

5. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing altered mental status, which may be attributed to sepsis, medication side effects, or other factors"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted to the ICU with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein and experienced altered mental status post-operation, which delayed extubation. She was finally extubated on [**2-18**] but still presents with altered mental status.

The patient's condition has shown improvement overall, with the ability to follow commands and a mild encephalopathy as indicated by an EEG. Cultures have been negative since [**2-11**], and the patient is being treated with antibiotics and flagyl until Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is ruled out. Liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and acute leukemia are among the ongoing concerns.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to leukemia and prolonged hospital stay, making her susceptible to various infections. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic coverage is crucial.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver enzymes are elevated, and an ultrasound reveals diffuse echogenic liver without focal lesions, suggesting fatty infiltrates. This could be associated with malnutrition or coagulopathy. Further evaluation and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein and delayed extubation due to altered mental status (AMS), but still exhibits AMS. Other medical issues include liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, renal failure, acute leukemia, epistaxis, and a positive PPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a history of high-grade VRE bacteremia and ongoing infection monitoring. There is a concern for further infections due to her immunocompromised state and indwelling lines.
2. Liver dysfunction: The patient has abnormal liver function tests and an echogenic liver on ultrasound, which may indicate liver disease or fatty infiltrates.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is low, which increases the risk of bleeding, especially with procedures or trauma.
4. Renal failure: The patient is anuric (not producing urine) and requires dialysis. Acute renal failure could be permanent or reversible.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of AMS, which can be associated with respiratory diseases. Oxygen saturation is maintained, but further monitoring is required.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein and experienced delayed extubation due to altered mental status (AMS), which is still present. She also has opacity on chest X-ray, likely aspiration post-extubation, and low-grade fevers. Other conditions include conjugated hyperbilirubinemia trending down since stopping voriconazole, coagulopathy with rising INR, acute renal failure (anuric), metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis, and VRE bacteremia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AMS: The patient's lethargy and opening of eyes following commands suggest a mild form of altered mental status. Further monitoring of ABG, cultures, and EEG is required to identify any underlying cause and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Nosocomial infection: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the source of neutropenic fever remains unidentified. Continuous monitoring for signs of infection and consideration of alternative treatments may be necessary.
3. Biphenotypic leukemia: The patient's marrow is showing signs of recovery. Daily ANC checks and platelet transfusions as needed should be continued.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient remains anuric, and intermittent hemodial"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and VRE bacteremia who is currently in the ICU. The patient is experiencing altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory failure, and has been extubated. 

The patient has a history of morphine allergy, nausea/vomiting, and has received various antibiotics including piperacillin, daptomycin, metronidazole, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). The patient is also on multiple infusions such as pantoprazole (Protonix), miconazole, chlorhexidine, daptomycin, G-CSF, moxifloxacin, magnesium, and calcium.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), a heart rate of 107 bpm with sinus tachycardia, blood pressure ranging from 160/90 mmHg to 140/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a face tent. The patient's weight has decreased from 105.5 kg at admission to 101 kg currently.

The patient has received a total of 1,934 mL of fluids, with an output of 75 mL of urine. The patient is not receiving any oral intake due to poor mouth swallowing and is being fed through a Dobhoff tube. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 7.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.9 g/dL, platelet count of 35 K/uL, sodium of 143 mEq/L, potassium of 3.9 mEq/L, chloride of 100 mEq/L, bicarbonate of 24.2%, BUN of 56 mg/dL, creatinine of 3.8 mg/dL, glucose of 187 mg/dL, and calcium of 7.9 mg/dL. The patient's blood cultures are positive for enterococcal bacteremia.

The patient's assessment and plan include liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and acute leukemia. The patient is still experiencing altered mental status, remains anuric, and will be receiving hemodialysis. The VRE bacteremia is being treated with daptomycin, and the leukemia is being monitored as the patient's counts begin to recover. 

The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, lines, dialysis catheter placement, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and the disposition is currently in the ICU with consideration for transfer to the floor."

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and delayed extubation post-op due to altered mental status (AMS), which has now improved.

The patient has multiple medical complications including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, acute renal failure (ARF), acute leukemia (ALL, AML, cancer, malignant neoplasm), and epistaxis.

The patient's AMS is expected to have a slow trajectory of recovery, and coagulopathy is still rising INR, likely due to nutrition deficiency versus synthetic dysfunction. There is also concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The patient's hypernatremia is likely secondary to free-water deficit from tube feeds, so increasing the frequency of free water flushes is recommended. 

The patient has been afebrile overnight, which may indicate immune reconstitution. Monitoring for evidence of infection is important, and continuing dapto/cefepime is recommended.

The patient has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with rising T-bili despite stopping Voriconazole and Zosyn. Fatty infiltrates of the liver were seen on ultrasound, suspecting coagulopathy due to nutrition deficiency or synthetic dysfunction. Re"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent an excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11 and delayed extubation due to altered mental status (AMS), which was eventually performed on 2/18. The patient's AMS has worsened, with mild encephalopathy observed on EEG. There have been no significant steps forward towards improvement, leading to a consideration of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for lymphoproliferative disorder evaluation and ruling out infectious or carcinomatous meningitis.

The patient's laboratory results show liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, acute renal failure, and leukopenia. Imaging studies reveal fatty infiltrates of the liver. The patient also has hypernatremia, low-grade fevers that have resolved, and conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with rising direct bilirubin levels.

The patient's clinical conditions include AMS, coagulopathy, epistaxis, VRE bacteremia, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia. The patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, vitamin K for coagulopathy, platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia, and continuing tube feeds. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is pending resolution of AMS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immune system is compromised due to neutropenia, making her susceptible to various infections. The presence of VRE bacteremia indicates a significant risk of infection.
2. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status (AMS) has persisted, and there are concerns about delirium, which can worsen outcomes in critically ill patients.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has anuric acute renal failure, and it is possible that she may progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
4. Hepatic Dysfunction: The patient's liver function tests are abnormal, indicating potential hepatic dysfunction. Fatty infiltrates of the liver observed on imaging raise concerns about liver damage.
5. Bleeding Disorders: Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding episodes, such as the patient's recent epistaxis.
6. Metabolic Imbalances: The patient has metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis, which require careful monitoring and management.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional information may be required for a comprehensive analysis."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU for post-operative hypotension and remains intubated. The patient has a history of VRE bacteremia. The patient's MS continues to be somnolent. 

24-hour events include the placement of a Dobhoff tube, elevation of t-bili, discontinuation of zosyn, switch to cefepime, discontinuation of neupogen as the patient is no longer neutropenic, and continued somnolence.

The patient has multiple medical conditions including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, and acute leukemia (biphenotypic).

The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/75mmHg to 124/67mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on face tent. 

Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased Hct and Plt, increased Cr, TCO2, glucose levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of CK, CKMB, Troponin-T, ALT, AST, Alk Phos, T Bili, D-dimer, LDH, and decreased levels of Ca++, Mg++, and PO4. 

Imaging shows a new Dobhoff tube placed in the stomach, which could be advanced further. Microbiology reports are pending.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Liver function abnormalities
2. Thrombocytopenia, acute
3. Metabolic acidosis
4. Respiratory alkalosis
5. Altered mental status (not delirium)
6. Acute renal failure
7. Acute leukemia (biphenotypic)

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, the patient is at risk for several medical complications. These include:

1. Infection: The patient has VRE bacteremia and is currently on antibiotics (cefepime). The patient's immunocompromised state due to leukemia increases the risk of infection.

2. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased urine output indicate possible acute renal failure. This could be due to sepsis, hypotension, or direct kidney damage.

3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count puts him at risk for bleeding complications, including internal bleeding or difficulty clotting.

4. Liver dysfunction: Abnormal liver function tests suggest possible liver dysfunction, which may be related to the patient's underlying medical conditions or medications.

5. Respiratory complications: The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (V"

   Assessment and Plan
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES:  Bili continues to rise. Zosyn stopped
   as could be contributing.  Repeat RUQ US wtih dopplers.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE:  To receive platelet transfusion for
   plt-7K.
 COAGULOPATHY:  INR continues to increase. Likely secondary to
   nutritional deficit and broad spectrum antibiotics.  Repeat DIC labs
   thus far not suggesting DIC.  Will give vitamin K.  Follow labs.
 VRE BACTEREMIA/SEPSIS:  Blood cultures from [**2-20**] no growth to
   date.
 C. DIFF:  Has been on flagyl, C. diff negative so will discontinue.
 HYPERNATREMIA:  Mild at this point.  Follow labs post dialysis.
   Replete free water as needed.
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM):  Less responsive today albeit
   does open eyes to command and able to follow simple commands (wiggle
   toes). Has been attributed to toxic/metabolic, seems likely. BMT thinks
   carcinomatous meningitis unlikely given no evidence of leukemia in bone
   marrow.   [**Month (only) 51**] be worse today since she has not been dialyzed since
   Friday.  Has not received sedating meds except zofran yesterday.  If
   not better post dialysis will need to discuss possible LP with BMT
   service.  Given altered mental status will continue to monitor in the
   ICU.
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF): Secondary to ATN in
   setting of hypotension and gentamicin.  Being dialyzed this morning.
   To be completed around 12:30.
 LEUKEMIA, ACUTE (ALL, AML, CANCER, MALIGNANT NEOPLASM):  biphenotypic

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia and VRE bacteremia who is experiencing respiratory failure and altered mental status.
- She was extubated on 2/19.
- The patient's responsiveness decreased this morning, which was temporally associated with receiving Zofran.
- The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, VRE bacteremia/sepsis, hypernatremia, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, and acute leukemia.
- The patient is currently being treated in the ICU and is receiving various medications and interventions, including dialysis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Liver Function Abnormalities: The patient's bilirubin levels continue to rise, indicating potential liver dysfunction. Further evaluation with repeat RUQ US with dopplers is recommended.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may increase the risk of bleeding. A platelet transfusion has been ordered.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR levels are increasing, suggesting impaired blood clotting function. Vitamin K has been administered, and follow-up labs are planned.
4. VRE Bacteremia/Sepsis: Blood cultures from 2/20 have shown no growth to date. The patient remains at risk for VRE-related complications.
5. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which needs to be closely monitored and managed, possibly with dialysis.
6. Altered Mental Status (Not Delirium): The patient's mental status has worsened, and it is believed to be caused by toxic/metabolic factors. Further evaluation and possible lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if the patient does not improve post-dialysis.
7. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, likely secondary to ATN in the setting of hypotension and gentamicin. Dialysis has been initiated.
8. Acute Leukemia: The patient has biphenotypic leukemia, which requires ongoing management and monitoring.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and appropriate treatment."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old male admitted to the ICU with altered mental status. The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. He presented with symptoms of acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis. Laboratory results indicate liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and signs of acute leukemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's elevated creatinine levels and decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) suggest impaired renal function. AKI can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infections, and cardiovascular complications.

2. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient's low bicarbonate level and high anion gap indicate metabolic acidosis. This condition can result in confusion, cardiovascular instability, and multiorgan dysfunction if not promptly treated.

3. Respiratory Alkalosis: The patient's elevated pH and decreased carbon dioxide levels suggest respiratory alkalosis. This could be due to hyperventilation caused by pain, anxiety, or other factors. Respiratory alkalosis can lead to dizziness, muscle cramps, and cardiac arrhythmias.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count increases the risk of bleeding and bruising. Thrombocytopenia can be caused by bone marrow suppression, sepsis, or disseminated intr"

She has a history of persistent neutropenia, high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia, septic thrombophlebitis, and altered mental status (AMS). The patient underwent an excision of her right basilic vein on 2/11 and extubation on 2/18. She remains AMS and has shown an unusually long course without significant improvement.

Medical Complications:
1. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's AMS is likely due to toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, but other causes such as infectious or carcinomatous meningitis have not been ruled out. An EEG showed mild encephalopathy, and a head CT scan was ordered to rule out intracranial abnormalities. A lumbar puncture was performed after platelet transfusion and vitamin K administration to check for infectious or carcinomatous meningitis.
2. Coagulopathy: The patient's INR is rising, suggesting a coagulation disorder. This may be due to nutritional deficiency or synthetic dysfunction. Repeat DIC labs were ordered, and a repeat blood smear was recommended. A Dobhoff tube was placed, and tube feeds were continued.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, likely secondary to free-water deficit from tube feeds. The frequency of free water"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on 2/11, extubation was delayed due to altered mental status, and she was finally extubated on 2/18 but still has AMS.

The patient's current condition includes worsening altered mental status (AMS), likely toxic-metabolic, with an unusual long course without significant steps forward toward improvement. An EEG shows mild encephalopathy, and the physician expects a waxing and waning trajectory of recovery. Despite this, the physician agrees to perform a lumbar puncture (LP) to rule out infectious meningitis or carcinomatous meningitis.

The patient also has a persistent low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) and coagulopathy, with a rising INR. This may be secondary to malnutrition or synthetic dysfunction, especially in the setting of severe thrombocytopenia. The physician recommends rechecking DIC labs today, repeating the platelet count, and placing a Dobhoff tube for tube feeds.

Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, which is likely secondary to free-water deficit from tube feeds. The physician increases the frequency of free water flushes from 30 mL every 8 hours to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She underwent an excision of her right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis and is currently experiencing altered mental status (AMS), which has been a concern for carcinomatous meningitis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, anemia/pancytopenia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure. She also has a history of positive PPD and is currently being treated with moxifloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Carcinomatous meningitis: The patient's AMS, along with the presence of cancer, raises concern for carcinomatous meningitis. Further investigation, including cytology from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is necessary to confirm this diagnosis.
2. Infection: Despite being afebrile and having no new culture growth, the patient's leukocytosis may indicate an ongoing infection. Surveillance cultures should continue, and RUQ ultrasound (US) should be monitored.
3. Disease recurrence: The leukocytosis could also be a sign of disease recurrence. Bone marrow examination may be needed to evaluate this possibility.
4. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: The elevated total bilir"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with altered mental status. They have been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions, including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, anemia, acute renal failure, and acute leukemia. The patient is currently on dialysis and receives prophylactic treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk of developing infections due to the use of central venous catheters for dialysis and mechanical ventilation.
2. Bleeding: Thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Kidney injury: Acute renal failure can lead to further deterioration of kidney function, requiring ongoing dialysis support.
4. Cancer progression: Acute leukemia may progress rapidly, necessitating prompt oncological intervention.
5. Liver dysfunction: Liver function abnormalities may worsen, leading to impaired metabolism and detoxification processes.
6. Delirium: Despite the unremarkable cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results, there is still a risk of delirium in critically ill patients, which can contribute to altered mental status.
7. Cardiovascular issues: The patient's vital signs indicate hypertension and tachycardia, indicating potential cardiovascular instability.
8. Malnutrition: Critically ill patients often experience nutritional deficiencies, which may"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and delayed extubation due to altered mental status (AMS), finally extubated on [**2-18**] but still experiencing AMS. 

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. AMS: The patient's mental status has not shown significant improvement despite extubation. The cause could be either carcinomatous meningitis (although no cells were found in the CSF) or a drug effect from moxifloxacin.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient exhibits increased sputum production, which may be an infectious source or a side effect of Neupogen. There is also a possibility of disease recurrence. 

3. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia: The patient's total bilirubin levels are trending down. The medications vori, zosyn, and moxi have been stopped, and repeat RUQ US is unchanged from prior.

","The patient's chief complaint is not specified in the progress note. The 24-hour events indicate that a blood culture was drawn from the VIP port at 12:08 PM. The RUQ remains unchanged from prior assessments. Cytology on CSF was canceled due to no cells found. The ID agreed that moxifloxacin may be causing the stupor, so it was discontinued. The plan is to transfuse her RBCs with HD.

Allergies include morphine, nausea/vomiting, and an unspecified antibiotic. The last doses of antibiotics administered were piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 02/22/20 at 04:00 PM, cefepime on 02/22/20 at 05:31 PM, metronidazole on 02/23/20 at 12:00 AM, and daptomycin on 02/23/20 at 07:34 PM.

Infusions include pantoprazole (Protonix) at 07:51 PM on 02/24/20. Other medications are not specified in the provided information.

Review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data as of 02/25/20 shows vital signs with a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F) and current temperature of 35.8 C (96.5 F). Heart rate is 80 bpm with a"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient with the ICU resident and was present
   during key portions of the services provided.  The assessment and plan
   was discussed and detailed above.  I would emphasize and add the
   following.  No change in mental status.  Getting HD this morning,
   tolerating hemodynamically.  Cough with purulent secretions in back of
   throat.
   Lungs with occasional scattered rhonchi   No rash  line sites look good
   WBC increased, diff pending  LP no growth to date, viral PCRs pending.
   As above will check CXR, culture sputum and urine. Blood cultures if
   spikes or WBC continues to trend upwards.
   Agree with detailed assessment and plan above.
   Stable for transfer to the oncology floor

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted for persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia. She had a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis, which resulted in the excision of her right basilic vein. The patient's mental status has been altered since the operation, and she is currently receiving hemodialysis (HD).

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 138/80 mmHg to 157/109 mmHg, heart rate of 80 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on face tent. The patient is alert and oriented, with no tenderness in the abdomen. There is evidence of peripheral edema.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, and lactic acid. Imaging reveals no acute intracranial abnormalities. 

Plan:

1. Liver Function Abnormalities: Monitor liver function tests (LFTs) and consider further evaluation if abnormalities persist.
2. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: Continue to monitor platelet counts and provide supportive care with"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and had delayed extubation due to altered mental status, finally extubated on [**2-18**], but still experiencing altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's current medical conditions include liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, acute renal failure (ARF), acute leukemia, and biphenotypic leukemia/pancytopenia.

The patient's recent assessments and plans are as follows:

1. AMS: The patient's mental status is fluctuating, and it is uncertain whether the cause is carcinomatous meningitis (although no cells are present in the CSF) or a drug effect from moxifloxacin. Further evaluation and monitoring are recommended.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, possibly due to infection or disease recurrence. Neupogen has been initiated, but infection should also be considered. Surveillance cultures should be continued, and if persistent, bone marrow examination may be necessary.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and delayed extubation due to altered mental status, finally extubated on [2-18] but still with altered mental status (AMS).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES: The patient has abnormal liver function tests, indicating possible liver dysfunction. This can be caused by various factors such as infections, medications, or underlying liver disease.

2. THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE: The patient is experiencing acute thrombocytopenia, which means a low platelet count. This can increase the risk of bleeding and may be related to bone marrow suppression due to leukemia or other causes.

3. ACIDOSIS, METABOLIC: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which is characterized by an imbalance in the body's acid-base balance. This can be caused by several factors including kidney dysfunction, respiratory problems, or severe infection.

4. ALKALOSIS, RESPIRATORY: The patient also has respiratory alkalosis, indicating an excess of bicarbonate in the blood. This can be associated with hyp"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. The patient underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [**2-11**] and had delayed extubation post-op due to altered mental status, which eventually occurred on [**2-18**]. However, the patient still exhibits altered mental status (AMS) and has been somewhat improved since yesterday.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 89 bpm (with a range of 72-93 bpm), blood pressure of 151/95 mmHg (with a range of 108/63-163/95 mmHg), respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute (with a range of 13-29 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient's weight is currently 93.8 kg, which is lower than the admission weight of 105.5 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.2-16.9 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin levels of 9.2-14.9 g/dL, and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts of 7-47 x 10^3/uL. The patient also has elevated levels of creatinine at 4.5-4.1 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 27.9-26.1 mg/dL, and lactate acid at 2.5 mmol/L. The patient's liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase levels at 240-15 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels at 29-15 U/L. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range except for hypernatremia, which has improved with increased free water flushes.

The patient's imaging studies reveal a stable cardiomediastinal silhouette with slight left retrocardiac opacity consistent with atelectasis. The dobbhoff tube tip is in the stomach, and the right central venous line tip is at the level of the cavoatrial junction.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status, acute renal failure, and biphenotypic leukemia. The patient is also diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring for evidence of infection, continuation of daptomycin for VRE bacteremia, consideration of tunneled line placement and removal of central line, avoidance of nephrotoxic agents"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia.
- She underwent excision of the right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis.
- Post-operative hypotension led to a delay in extubation, which was finally done on [**2-18**], but the patient still has altered mental status (AMS).
- The patient has multiple medical complications including liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, acute renal failure, acute leukemia, and hypernatremia.
- The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with some improvements and ongoing management of various issues.
- The patient is currently in the ICU, receiving dialysis, and is expected to be transferred to BMT when a bed becomes available.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient has been experiencing altered mental status (AMS) since the post-operative period, which may be exacerbated by medications such as moxifloxacin known to cause delirium.
2. Infection: The patient has a history of high-grade VRE bacteremia and is currently on daptomycin. There is a concern for possible line infection or septic thrombophlebitis.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has developed anuric acute renal failure, possibly due to"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade VRE bacteremia. She underwent an excision of her right basilic vein due to septic thrombophlebitis and now presents with post-operative hypotension. The patient remains intubated and is still experiencing altered mental status. She has a history of pancytopenia, acute renal failure, and anemia. She has been transfusion-dependent and has had various infections, including a positive PPD.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acidosis, Metabolic: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which can be caused by several factors such as lactic acidosis or renal dysfunction. Monitoring and addressing the underlying cause is important.
2. Alkalosis, Respiratory: The patient also has respiratory alkalosis, possibly due to hyperventilation or mechanical ventilation. Adjusting ventilation settings and ensuring adequate oxygenation is necessary.
3. Thrombocytopenia, Acute: The patient has acute thrombocytopenia, which increases the risk of bleeding. Close monitoring of platelet count and appropriate management, including transfusion, is crucial.
4. Renal Failure, Acute (Acute Kidney Injury, AKI): The patient has acute renal failure, likely due to hypotension or gentamicin use. Renal replacement therapy may be required, and nephrotoxic agents"

    MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
    I saw and examined the patient with the medical ICU resident and was
   present during key portions of the services provided.  The assessment
   and plan was discussed and is detailed above. I would emphasize and add
   the following.  No significant change in level of responsiveness.
   Tolerated HD yesterday with removal of ~3L.  On room air this morning,
   good sats.  Still with oral secretions.  Lungs clear Abdomen soft with
   BS
   CXR: No new infiltrate or CHF
   No new micro data, CSF studies negative to date.
   Still have no clear etiology of altered mental status.  Patient to
   continue HD MWF.  Follow-up on CSF results.
   Trying to stop medications as above that may be contributing.  Patient
   is not requiring ICU level care.
   Agree with detailed assessment and plan as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with biphenotypic leukemia who was admitted with persistent neutropenia and high-grade vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia attributed to a line infection and septic thrombophlebitis. She underwent excision of the right basilic vein on [2-11] and had delayed extubation post-op due to altered mental status, which has persisted. The patient's current condition includes liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, altered mental status (not delirium), acute renal failure, and acute leukemia.

Medical Complications:
1. AMS (Altered Mental Status): The patient has been experiencing altered mental status since admission, which is not improving significantly. The possible cause of AMS could be moxifloxacin, as quinolones are known to cause delirium.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient is pancytopenic with thrombocytopenia that may be resolving after stopping cefepime.
3. Conjugated Hyperbilirubinemia: The patient has conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a trend downward. The repeat RUQ US is unchanged from prior.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy that is improving with vitamin K.
5. Anemia/Pancytopenia: The patient has been transfusion"
