","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and s/p TIPS. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.1 F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/44 to 78/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is currently receiving levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia, and her fluid balance shows a total intake of 19 mL and output of 145 mL. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated potassium level of 6.2 mEq/L, low sodium level of 70 K/uL, and high blood glucose level of 181 mg/dL. The assessment and plan include the following: 
1) Hypotension: Possible causes include pneumonia/infectious process, liver failure, or hypovolemia. Continuing levofloxacin for pneumonia, following culture data, using albumin for intravascular repletion if needed, and performing a formal ECHO in the morning.
2) Chest pain: Limited by history, possibly due to pneumonia or pulmonary embolism. Continuing levofloxacin, obtaining a PA/Lat film today if possible, and performing a bilateral lower extremity venous ultrasound (LENS) due to renal failure"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient was admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of hypotension and suspected pneumonia. The patient received a fluid bolus and albumin infusion to address the hypotension, which improved their blood pressure to the 110s. Levofloxacin was started for presumed pneumonia. The patient was also weaned from nonrebreather mask to room air and given kayexalate for a high potassium level of 6.2.

The patient has no known drug allergies. The last dose of antibiotics was given at 03:45 AM on 08/22/2132. Heparin sodium infusion for prophylaxis was started at 01:30 AM on 08/22/2132.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flow sheet data shows vital signs within normal ranges, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation.

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a stable fluid balance with a total intake of 19 mL and output of 145 mL, including 100 mL of blood products. The patient's respiratory support has been discontinued, and they are breathing on their own with room air.

Physical examination findings are not available for peripheral vascular, skin, neurologic assessments, or other systems. Lab results indicate an elevated potassium level of 6.2, as well as elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, glucose, and lactate dehydrogen"

The patient's acute renal failure is suspected to be pre-renal azotemia or hepatorenal syndrome, and kayexalate was continued until BM. The patient's mental status improved, and lactulose and rifaximin were continued. An abdominal US was ordered, and the patient was scheduled to see a hepatologist in the morning. The patient's coagulopathy was stable, and vitamin K was given. Fluid overload was noted due to elevated right-sided pressures, but the patient was not diuresed because of acute renal failure and concern for hepatorenal syndrome. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were good on room air.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia/infectious process, liver failure, or hypovolemia. The potential medical complications associated with hypotension include organ dysfunction and failure, decreased tissue perfusion, shock, and sepsis.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS presenting with chest pain and acute renal failure. The patient's overnight hypotension responded to fluid resuscitation with normal saline and albumin. Levofloxacin was started for presumed pneumonia. The patient was weaned off NRB to room air. Kayexalate was given for a potassium level of 6.2. The patient has not been assessed for peripheral vascular, skin, or neurologic status. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The differential diagnosis includes pneumonia/infectious process, liver failure, and hypovolemia. It is important to continue levofloxacin, follow culture data, and monitor fluid balance. A formal ECHO should be done in the morning.

2. Chest pain: The cause of the chest pain could be pneumonia or a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Levofloxacin should be continued, and a PA/Lat film should be obtained if possible. Bilateral lower extremity venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (LENS) has been given due to the inability to perform a contrast CT angiography (CTA) because of renal failure.

3. Acute renal failure: The FENa is less than 1%, indicating pre-renal azotemia. However, there has been no improvement with hydration. Hepatorenal syndrome is also"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with a history of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) presenting with hypotension, respiratory distress, chest pain, acute renal failure, anemia, acidosis, and coagulopathy. She has decompensated heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), and worsening mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing low blood pressure, which can be caused by various factors such as ischemic cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism (PE), septic shock, or hypovolemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

2. Hyperkalemia: The patient has elevated potassium levels, which can be dangerous and lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Treatment with Kayexylate, D5, insulin, and repeat monitoring is necessary to manage this condition.

3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can be due to low forward flow and possible dehydration. A trial of Lasix may be considered after discussing with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1174**].

4. Non-gap Acidosis: The patient has a non-gap acidosis, which may be caused by the loss of bicarbonate in stool due to lactulose use or renal tubular acidosis. Further evaluation is required to determine the exact cause,"

   Story is not well delineated (not able to tell us about the quality of
   the pain). No fever and unimpressive WBC, but the physical exam is
   relatively localized at the left base. Taken with the CXR, patient may
   have a pneumonia at left base. Will place patient on levofloxacin.
   Chest pain may have represented pleurisy. An alternative dx could be
   pulmonary embolism (despite mild coagulopathy) with atelectasis. Will
   obtain LENI's in the AM. Cannot do CTA with acute renal failure.
   Oxygenation has improved (patient now with sats in the 95-97% range off
   of supplemental oxygen), but patient still tachypneic with use of
   accessory muscles of ventilation consistent with increased drive to
   breathe, perhaps related to stimulation of pulmonary receptors.
   No evidence of cardiac ischemia. With low voltage on ECG, will check
   echo in the AM for pericardial effusion. Character of pain not
   classical for pericarditis and ECG not  suggestive other than low
   voltage.
   Patient with non-gap acidosis.This may be due to loss of bicarb in
   stool with use of lactulose. Alternatively, patient may have renal
   tubular acidosis. Patient's tachypnea/hyperventilation appears largely
   due to compensation for the metabolic acidosis. Monitor bicarb.
   Consider replacement if it drops further.
   Etiology of acute renal failure unclear. Concern about hepato-renal
   syndrome. Check urine sediment and electrolytes. Would not diurese now
   with improved oxygenation.
   Mild coagulopathy due to liver failure. No evidence of bleeding now.
   Administer vitamin K.
   Cause of hypotension unclear. Possible cytokine release if pneumonia
   present; superimposed on liver failuire and typical shunting associated
   with that, patient could then have become hypotensive. BP has been
   stable since in ICU. Monitor without diuresis for now.
   Hct stable. Not at threshold for transfusion.

","Summary:
The patient is a woman with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cirrhosis who presented with chest pain. She is currently in the ICU for hypotension and has been on various medications, including heparin sodium and levofloxacin. Her vital signs show a stable temperature, heart rate within normal range, and low blood pressure. She is breathing at a rate of 20 breaths per minute and has a SpO2 of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for chest pain. Her flow sheet data indicates fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which may be due to multiple factors such as liver failure, pneumonia, or cytokine release. Monitoring and managing her blood pressure is crucial.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient has tachypnea and uses accessory muscles of ventilation, indicating respiratory distress. This could be related to pneumonia or compensation for metabolic acidosis.
3. Chest Pain: The patient's chest pain may represent pleurisy or atelectasis. Further investigation, such as obtaining LEARN in the AM, is necessary to determine the cause.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by elevated creatinine levels. Hepato-renal syndrome is a concern, and further evaluation of urine sediment and electrolytes is needed.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension: DDx includes pneumonia/infectious process versus
   liver failure versus hypovolemia.  Cardiogenic process less likely with
   negative cardiac markers and no ischemic changes on ECG.
   -          Continue levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Fluids, preferably albumin for intravascular repletion if
   needed
   -          Formal ECHO in AM
   2)       Chest pain: Limited by history.  Pnuemonia (?retrocardiac
   opacity and possible pleurisy) versus PE.
   -          Continue levoflox
   -          PA/Lat film today if possible
   -          B/L LENIS given unable to do CTA due to renal failure
   3)       Acute renal failure: FENa is <1%.  Pre-renal azotemia
   possible, though not improving with hydration.  Hepatorenal syndrome on
   differential.
   -          Cont kayexalate until BM
   -          Check potassium following kayexalate
   4)       Cirrhosis:  Mental status improved per family.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Abdominal US
   -          Hepatology to see in AM
   5)       Coagulopathy: Stable.
   -          Vit K PO
   6)       Fluid overload: With elevated right sided pressures, though
   with good O2 sats.
   -       Would not diurese currently in setting of ARF and concern for
   hepatorenal sx, satting well on RA

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The differential diagnosis for her hypotension includes pneumonia/infectious process, liver failure, and hypovolemia. Cardiogenic process is less likely due to negative cardiac markers and no ischemic changes on ECG. The patient is currently on levofloxacin for presumed pneumonia, and further culture data will be followed. Fluids, preferably albumin, may be given for intravascular repletion if needed, and a formal ECHO will be done in the morning.

The patient's chest pain is limited by history, and the possible causes include pneumonia (retrocardiac opacity and possible pleurisy) versus PE. Levofloxacin will be continued, and a PA/Lat film will be obtained today if possible. Bilateral lower extremity venous compression (LENS) will be given as CT angiography (CTA) is contraindicated due to renal failure.

The patient has acute renal failure with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) <1%, suggesting pre-renal azotemia that is not improving with hydration. Hepatorenal syndrome is also on the differential. Kayexalate will be continued until blood methemoglobin levels (BM) are checked, and potassium levels will be monitored"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension: Review of ECGs by cardiology and new findings on
   ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension, possibly from recent
   ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt w/o increased WBC or
   fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in the setting recent
   MI, or could be cardiomyopathy related to PNA.
   -          Continue to treat PNA
   -          Change Levo to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin as Levo more
   likely to worsen mental status and result in C-diff.
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Fluids, preferably albumin for intravascular repletion if
   needed, consider PRBC if HCT decreasing.
   -          F/u formal ECHO today
   -          Send C-diff
   2)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI versus  Pnuemonia (?retrocardiac opacity and possible

   assessing PE, but pt w/ worsening renal function. With good explanation
   for hypotension from cardiomyopathy, will defer r/o of PE.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with hypotension (improved) in the setting of new
   systolic and valvular acute CHF, and chronic severe liver disease/HCC,
   as well as possible pneumonia.
   The main challenge is trying to perfuse her kidneys adequately in the
   setting of new CHF and acute renal failure.  We will place an arterial
   line and measure SVV and a pulse-contour assessment of cardiac output.
   We will attempt to volume resuscitate until we see signs of pulmonary
   edema, and then consider either diuresis or inotropic therapy.  Will
   prefer blood or albumin as volume challenge.  If moving to inotropic
   therapy, may place more invasive monitors.  Will measure pre- and
   post-challenge
   Encephalopathy
 likely hepatic + toxic-metabolic.  Continue current
   rx.  Change levoflox to CTX/azithro in case it is contributing
   Diabetes
 tighten glycemic control a bit

   Coagulopathy
 suspect DIC may be playing a role, as well as liver
   disease.  PTT of 150 does not appear to be an artifact.  Will consult
   hematology and consider transfusing cryo given low fibrinogen.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a chief complaint of acute renal failure (ARF) and congestive heart failure (CHF). She has a history of chronic severe liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient presented with hypotension, new systolic and valvular acute CHF, possible pneumonia, and acute renal failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/54 to 119/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation support.

Physical examination findings include jugular venous distention to the angle of the jaw, bronchial breath sounds with minimal crackles at the left base, and soft non-tender abdomen. Extremity pulses are absent on the right side and present on the left side. Neurological examination reveals no purposeful movement or response to noxious stimuli.

Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, low potassium levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormalities in coagulation profile. Other lab values indicate possible metabolic encephalopathy, diabetes, anemia, acidosis, and coagulopathy.

Assessment and Plan:

The main challenge is to adequately perfuse the kidneys while managing new CHF and acute renal failure. The plan includes placing an arterial line to measure stroke volume"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension: Review of ECGs by cardiology and new findings on
   ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension, possibly from recent
   ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt w/o increased WBC or
   fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in the setting recent
   MI, or could be cardiomyopathy related to PNA.
   -          Continue to treat PNA
   -          Change Levo to Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin as Levo more
   likely to worsen mental status and result in C-diff.
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Fluids, preferably albumin for intravascular repletion if
   needed, consider PRBC if HCT decreasing.
   -          F/u formal ECHO today
   -          Send C-diff
   2)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI versus  Pnuemonia (?retrocardiac opacity and possible
   pleurisy) versus PE.  B/L LENIS showed no DVT, CT-[**MD Number(3) 2375**] be best for
   assessing PE, but pt w/ worsening renal function. With good explanation
   for hypotension from cardiomyopathy, will defer r/o of PE.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          Cycle CEs
   -          Consider VQ scan for PE if respiratory status worsening.
   3)       Acute renal failure: FENa is <1%.  Pre-renal azotemia
   possible, though not improving with hydration.  Hepatorenal syndrome on
   differential.  Pt w/ hypotension and worsening ARF likely secondary to
   decreased cardiac output.
   -          Hyperkalemia resolved, too low, repelated with 20meq of KCl
   -          Re-check PM lytes
   -          Attempt to increase renal perfusion and improve urine output
   w/ Albumin and blood product.
   -          Will follow urine Na and Osms before and after albumin to
   detect positive renal response
   -          Consider a-line placement and noninvasive measurement of
   cardiac output w/ Vigileo
   4)       Cirrhosis:  Mental status worse today per family. Etiology
   unclear. Abd US showed patent flow through TIPs and normal liver.
   Possible multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in
   setting of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          D/c the levofloxacin
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Low threshod for starting Midodrine/Octreotide
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5, platelets at 52, Fibrinogen 66.
   Unclear etiology of coagulopathy. Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but
   could also represent additional process of DIC or TTP/HUS..
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days.
   -          Send smear for schistocytes
   -          Hematology c/s- f/u recs
   6)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   7)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   8)       FEN: pt obtunded, will need to place NGT and get nutrition

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS who presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving treatment for pneumonia, including antibiotics such as levofloxacin, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone. She has also been given albumin and red blood cell transfusion. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Her neurological examination shows unresponsiveness with downward toes and mild asterixis of the wrist. The patient's lab results indicate elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count, and signs of renal dysfunction. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac etiology of hypotension: The patient's chest pain, hypotension, and new findings on echocardiogram suggest a cardiac cause for her hypotension, possibly from recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or pneumonia-related cardiomyopathy.
2. Lower lobe process (PNA or PE): The patient's chest pain and respiratory symptoms may be due to pneumonia or pulmonary embolism (PE). Further evaluation is needed, including imaging studies and diagnostic tests, due to the patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy related to PNA.
   Addition finding of possible UTI could also be contributing.
   -          Continue to treat PNA
   -          Given recent hospitalization prior to admission, pt meets
   criteria for HAP, will change VANC, Zosyn, and Azithromycin
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Was fully volume resuscitated yesterday, and developed some
   pulmonary edema. Hold off on fluids this am, but will monitor urine
   output. If < 30 cc/hr will try additional albumin/IVF/blood, or
   consider Dobutamine to increase CO or hydralazine to decrease
   afterload.

   assessing PE, but pt w/ worsening renal function. With good explanation
   for hypotension from cardiomyopathy, will defer r/o of PE. CEx have
   been stable at 0.05,0.04, 0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**]

   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   3)       Acute renal failure: FENa is <1%. (0.3% this am) Pre-renal
   azotemia possible, though not initially improving with hydration.
   Hepatorenal syndrome also on differential.  Pt w/ hypotension and
   worsening ARF likely secondary to decreased cardiac output. UOP did not
   respond to > 1.5L IVF until pt given 10mg IV lasix. Then UOP improved.
   Lasix response evidence of better renal perfusion.
   -          Re-check PM lytes
   -          Attempt to increase renal perfusion and improve urine output
   w/ Albumin and blood product as before, consider adding
   Dobutamine/Hydralazine as described above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS who presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition has been complicated by several factors including cardiogenic shock, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's renal function has not improved despite fluid resuscitation and there are concerns about potential complications such as disseminated intravascular coagulation or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock due to possible recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or pneumonia.
2. Pneumonia with worsening cardiac function, possibly related to recent AMI or cardiomyopathy.
3. Urinary tract infection (UTI) that could be contributing to the patient's hypotension and acute renal failure.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome in the setting of cirrhosis and acute renal failure.
5. Hypernatremia due to overall hypovolemia.
6. Coagulopathy likely secondary to liver cirrhosis, but could also represent additional processes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with hypotension (improved) in the setting of new
   systolic and valvular acute CHF, and chronic severe liver disease/HCC,
   as well as likely pneumonia.  Even after her hypotension improved, she
   still had evidence of occult hypoperfusion with ARF, altered mental
   status, and mildly elevated lactate.
    Hemodynamics: Acute systolic and valvular CHF, cirrhosis, and acute
   renal failure
   The main challenge is trying to perfuse her kidneys adequately in the
   setting of new CHF and acute renal failure.
   Her response to volume challenge is equivocal: her UNa improved but she
   developed pulmonary edema.  Her urine output appears to have picked up
   after Lasix, rather than in response to fluids.  (Lasix was reportedly
   given at about 2a, rather than at 5a as is written in [**Month (only) **]).  Likely, we
   corrected her hypovolemia and allowed her to respond to Lasix.
   Today, we will follow her.  If her urine output falls, will consider
   trial of afterload reduction with hydralazine if BP will tolerate, and
   dobutamine if not.  Will discuss octreotide/midodrine further at that
   point.
   Encephalopathy
   Likely hepatic + toxic-metabolic.  Improved a bit.  Continue current
   rx.
   Pneumonia
   Will broaden to vanco, zosyn, azithro.  Avoiding quinolones in case
   contritubted to encephalopathy.
   Anemia
   Appreciate hematology
s help.
   Acid/base
   There is a substantial component of respiratory alkalosis here, though
   the disorder is mixed.
   Coagulopathy
   Appreciate hematology

   Cirrhosis

   haziness, likely increasing effusion, suggests new CHF.
   CXR [**2132-8-24**]: Persistent retrocardiac opacity is present suggesting
   atelectasis, although focal consolidation cannot be excluded.
   IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting of recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] to PNA, though
   given ECG, MI more likely.
   -          Continue to treat PNA, given recent hospitalization prior to
   admission, pt meets criteria for HAP, abx were changed to VANC, Zosyn,
   and Azithromycin.
   -          Follow culture data and repeat C-diff
   -          Hypotension resolved w/ fluids and has remained stable in
   the 90s-120s
   -          LOS fluid total is + 6-7L
   2)       Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology. On presentation FENa <
   1/% (0.3 on Saturday) suggesting pre-renal azotemia however renal
   function did not improve w/ hydration that was sufficient to bring SBPs
   to 120s and cause early pulmonary edema, however she did respond to
   lasix at that time suggesting some improved renal perfusion. Since,
   urine output has decreased and failed to respond to lasix 20mg IV x2.
   Pt appears fluid overloaded w/ end expiratory wheezes on exam, some
   increased upper extremity edema, and continued increased work of
   breathing. Hydralazine was started without significant increase in UOP.
   Overall, intravascular fluid volume is not clear.
   -          Attempted to increase renal perfusion and improve urine
   output w/ Albumin and blood product and hydralazine, will consider
   adding Dobutamine to increase CO.
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider a-line placement and noninvasive measurement of
   cardiac output w/ Vigileo versus or placement of a IJ line for CVP
   measurement and adjust IVF accordingly.
   -          Discuss CVVH or HD w/ renal
   2.5) Tachypnea and increased WOB. Pt has been maintaining good O2 sats
   on room air up to this point, despite her  tachypnea and extensive use
   of  accessory muscles. Etiology of her tachypnea is unclear and may be
   due to a combination of her liver disease, PNA, and new CHF.
   - AM CXRs
   - Consider elective intubation as patient is somnolent and may not be
   able to protect her airway in the setting of tube feeds and poor MS.
   3)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI at that time seems likely as signs of ASMI on ECGs and echo
   showing new decreased EF and global hypokinesis since [**1-26**] . Other
   etiologies considered were PE and PNA. Pt had LE U/S with no DVT, CT-PA
   deferred for poor renal function. CEx have been stable at 0.05,0.04,
   0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**] her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          On BB for post-MI
   3.3) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall hypovolemia. Will treat
   w/ free water flushes at 100cc q4 hours w/ TFs.
   -       resolved, will follow sodium
   4)       Cirrhosis and poor mental status: MS improved yesterday after
   hydration and d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible
   multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting
   of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI. Given renal failure,
   question of HRS.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider invasive CVP monitoring as above for intravascular
   status
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 yesterday, now 2.9, platelets at 42
   from 33.  Fibrinogen 66, FDP 0-10. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy.
   Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional
   process of DIC or TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest
   that unlikely to TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear,
   likely [**12-22**] liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous
   thrombocyto penia and pancytopenia.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear
   tomorrow, appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20.
   6)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   7)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   8)       FEN: NGT placed yesterday and TFs began. Free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS. She presented with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock with clear end organ hypoperfusion and ARF. There are new findings on ECG and echo suggesting a cardiac etiology of hypotension, possibly from recent ASMI. Possible LLL process, possibly pneumonia (PNA), is also considered. The patient's tachypnea and increased work of breathing may be due to a combination of liver disease, PNA, and new congestive heart failure (CHF). She has chest pain that started one week prior, and myocardial infarction (MI) seems likely. Other etiologies considered were pulmonary embolism (PE) and PNA. The patient had a CT-PA deferred due to poor renal function. The patient's coagulopathy may be related to liver cirrhosis, but additional processes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) are also possible. The patient has a history of previous thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock
2. Acute renal failure
3. Congestive heart failure (CHF)
4. Pneumonia (PNA)
5. Liver cirrhosis
6. Hepatic encephalopathy
7. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
8. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS)
9. Pulmonary embolism (PE)
10. Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (HVD)

Please note that the above summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. Further evaluation and assessment by a healthcare professional is necessary for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy related to PNA.
   Addition finding of possible UTI could also be contributing.
   -          Continue to treat PNA
   -          Given recent hospitalization prior to admission, pt meets
   criteria for HAP, will change VANC, Zosyn, and Azithromycin
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Was fully volume resuscitated yesterday, and developed some
   pulmonary edema. Hold off on fluids this am, but will monitor urine
   output. If < 30 cc/hr will try additional albumin/IVF/blood, or
   consider Dobutamine to increase CO or hydralazine to decrease
   afterload.
   -          F/u other cx data and C-diff
   2)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI versus  Pnuemonia (?retrocardiac opacity and possible
   pleurisy) versus PE.  B/L LENIS showed no DVT, CT-[**MD Number(3) 2375**] be best for
   assessing PE, but pt w/ worsening renal function. With good explanation
   for hypotension from cardiomyopathy, will defer r/o of PE. CEx have
   been stable at 0.05,0.04, 0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**]
   her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   3)       Acute renal failure: FENa is <1%. (0.3% this am) Pre-renal
   azotemia possible, though not initially improving with hydration.
   Hepatorenal syndrome also on differential.  Pt w/ hypotension and
   worsening ARF likely secondary to decreased cardiac output. UOP did not
   respond to > 1.5L IVF until pt given 10mg IV lasix. Then UOP improved.
   Lasix response evidence of better renal perfusion.
   -          Re-check PM lytes
   -          Attempt to increase renal perfusion and improve urine output
   w/ Albumin and blood product as before, consider adding
   Dobutamine/Hydralazine as described above.
   -          Consider a-line placement and noninvasive measurement of
   cardiac output w/ Vigileo
   3.5) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Likely [**12-22**] to overall hypovolemia. Will treat w/
   free water flushes at 100cc q4 hours w/ TFs.
   -       PM lytes
   4)       Cirrhosis:  Mental status improved today after hydration and
   d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible multifactorial w/
   baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting of cardiogenic
   hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Low threshod for starting Midodrine/Octreotide
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5, platelets at 52 -> 33, Fibrinogen
   66. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy. Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis,
   but could also represent additional process of DIC or
   TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest that unlikely to
   TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear, likely [**12-22**] liver
   and renal failure.  Pt also has had hx of previous thrombocyto penia
   and pancytopenia.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and a previous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) who presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

1. Hypotension: The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, with clear end-organ hypoperfusion and acute renal failure. There are new findings on echocardiogram suggesting a cardiac etiology of hypotension, possibly from recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Other possible causes include pneumonia (PNA) or a urinary tract infection (UTI).

2. Chest pain: The patient has limited ability to provide a detailed history of the chest pain, which appears to have started one week prior. The differential diagnosis includes myocardial infarction (MI), pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism (PE). However, with the worsening renal function, further evaluation for PE may be deferred.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient has pre-renal azotemia with a fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) less than 1%. Hepatorenal syndrome is also on the differential diagnosis. The patient's hypotension and worsening acute renal failure are likely secondary to decreased cardiac output. Response to intravenous fluid administration has been poor, but there was an improvement in urine output"

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy related to PNA.
   Addition finding of possible UTI could also be contributing.
   -          Continue to treat PNA
   -          Given recent hospitalization prior to admission, pt meets
   criteria for HAP, will change VANC, Zosyn, and Azithromycin
   -          Follow culture data
   -          Was fully volume resuscitated yesterday, and developed some
   pulmonary edema. Hold off on fluids this am, but will monitor urine
   output. If < 30 cc/hr will try additional albumin/IVF/blood, or
   consider Dobutamine to increase CO or hydralazine to decrease
   afterload.

","The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS, presenting with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is likely experiencing cardiogenic shock, as evidenced by clear end-organ hypoperfusion, acute renal failure, and possible myocardial infarction. There is also a suspicion of pneumonia, which could be worsening cardiac function in the setting of recent myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy related to pneumonia. Additionally, there is a possibility of urinary tract infection.

The patient has been treated for pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia, and the culture data should be followed. Fluid resuscitation has been attempted, but pulmonary edema has developed. Therefore, fluid administration will be held off, and urine output will be monitored. If the urine output is less than 30 cc/hr, additional albumin/IVF/blood or dobutamine to increase cardiac output or hydralazine to decrease afterload may be considered.

The patient's chest pain is limited by history and appears to have started one week prior. It could be due to myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism. Since the patient has worsening renal function, a CT scan to assess for pulmonary embolism may be deferred, and the elevated troponin levels may remain elevated due to acute renal failure.

The patient has acute renal failure with a FENa of less than 1%."

   IMPRESSION: No significant change from prior.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting of recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] to PNA, though
   given ECG, MI more likely.
   -          Continue to treat PNA, given recent hospitalization prior to
   admission, pt meets criteria for HAP, abx were changed to VANC, Zosyn,
   and Azithromycin.
   -          Follow culture data and repeat C-diff
   -          Hypotension resolved w/ fluids and has remained stable in
   the 90s-120s
   2)       Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology. On presentation FENa <
   1/% (0.3 on Saturday) suggesting pre-renal azotemia however renal
   function did not improve w/ hydration that was sufficient to bring SBPs
   to 120s and cause early pulmonary edema, however she did respond to
   lasix at that time suggesting some improved renal perfusion. Since,
   urine output has decreased and failed to respond to lasix 20mg IV x2.
   Pt appears fluid overloaded w/ end expiratory wheezes on exam, some
   increased upper extremity edema, and continued increased work of
   breathing. Hydralazine was started without significant increase in UOP.
   -          Attempt to increase renal perfusion and improve urine output
   w/ Albumin and blood product as before, consider adding Dobutamine to
   increase CO.
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider a-line placement and noninvasive measurement of
   cardiac output w/ Vigileo
   2.5) Tachypnea and increased WOB. Pt has been maintaining good O2 sats
   on room air up to this point, despite her  tachypnea and extensive use
   of  accessory muscles. Etiology of her tachypnea is unclear and may be
   due to a combination of her liver disease, PNA, and new CHF.
   - AM CXRs
   - Consider elective intubation as patient is somnolent and may not be
   able to protect her airway in the setting of tube feeds and poor MS.
   3)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI at that time seems likely as signs of ASMI on ECGs and echo
   showing new decreased EF and global hypokinesis since [**1-26**] . Other
   etiologies considered were PE and PNA. Pt had LE U/S with no DVT, CT-PA
   deferred for poor renal function. CEx have been stable at 0.05,0.04,
   0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**] her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          On BB for post-MI
   3.3) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Likely [**12-22**] to overall hypovolemia. Will treat w/
   free water flushes at 100cc q4 hours w/ TFs.
   -       PM lytes
   4)       Cirrhosis and poor mental status: MS improved yesterday after
   hydration and d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible
   multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting
   of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 yesterday, now 2.9, platelets at 42
   from 33.  Fibrinogen 66, FDP 0-10. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy.
   Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional
   process of DIC or TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest
   that unlikely to TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear,
   likely [**12-22**] liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous
   thrombocyto penia and pancytopenia.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear
   tomorrow, appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and TIPS who presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has been experiencing worsening liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, and portal hypertension. She has been admitted multiple times for hospitalization prior to admission.

The patient's current condition includes hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, with clear end organ hypoperfusion and acute renal failure. There are new findings on ECG and echo suggesting a cardiac etiology of hypotension, possibly from recent ASMI. The patient also has possible lower lobe pneumonia, though without increased WBC or fever. Pneumonia could be worsening cardiac function in the setting of recent MI, or it could be cardiomyopathy. The patient's respiratory support consists of supplemental oxygen delivery.

The patient's labs show elevated lactate levels, indicating tissue hypoperfusion. She has hypernatremia, likely secondary to overall hypovolemia. The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to liver cirrhosis, but could also represent an additional process of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). 

The patient's medical history includes HCV cirrhosis, HCC, TIPS, and previous thrombocytopenia"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with hypotension (improved) in the setting of new
   systolic and valvular acute CHF, and chronic severe liver disease/HCC,
   as well as likely pneumonia.  Even after her hypotension improved, she
   still had evidence of occult hypoperfusion with ARF, altered mental
   status, and mildly elevated lactate.
   1. Hemodynamics: Acute systolic and valvular CHF, cirrhosis, and acute
   renal failure. The main challenge is trying to perfuse her kidneys
   adequately in the setting of new CHF and acute renal failure. Her
   response to volume challenge is equivocal: her UNa improved but she
   developed pulmonary edema.  Her urine output appears to have picked up
   after Lasix, rather than in response to fluids. Likely, we corrected
   her hypovolemia and allowed her to respond to Lasix. At this point, by
   exam she seems even more overloaded and we need to push to get fluid
   off. We will start Lasix drip., speak with Hpeatology about role of
   Midodrine/Octreotide, and Renal about issue of eventual HD or CVVH.
   2. Encephalopathy : Likely hepatic + toxic-metabolic.  Head CT prelim
   read negative.
   3. Pneumonia - Will broaden to vanco, zosyn, azithro.  Avoiding
   quinolones in case contritubted to encephalopathy.

   Critical Care 40 min
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with several significant medical conditions. She has hypotension that has improved, new systolic and valvular acute congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic severe liver disease with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and likely pneumonia. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure (ARF), altered mental status, and mildly elevated lactate levels.

The main concerns in this case are the patient's hemodynamics, encephalopathy, pneumonia, anemia, coagulopathy, and cirrhosis. The patient's hemodynamic status is complicated by acute systolic and valvular CHF, cirrhosis, and acute renal failure. There is a challenge in adequately perfusing the kidneys in the setting of new CHF and acute renal failure. The patient's response to volume challenge is equivocal, as she developed pulmonary edema after her hypotension improved. Her urine output has improved after receiving Lasix.

The patient's encephalopathy is likely hepatic with possible toxic-metabolic causes. A head CT scan was performed, which showed no abnormalities.

The patient also has pneumonia, and broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover potential pathogens. Quinolones have been avoided due to concerns about contributing to encephalopathy.

Other issues include anemia, coagulopathy, and cirrhosis management, which will require input from the hematology and hepatology teams"

   Today, we will follow her.  If her urine output falls, will consider
   trial of afterload reduction with hydralazine if BP will tolerate, and

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for evaluation and management. She has been experiencing a rapid heart rhythm, which initially appeared to be ventricular tachycardia but later converted to a narrow complex tachycardia and was successfully treated with amiodarone and lopressor. The patient's ejection fraction (EF) has significantly decreased from 40% to 25% based on the repeat echocardiogram. She is currently on a Lasix drip and receiving boluses of Diuril, responding well with good urine output.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and recent rapid heart rhythm suggest a risk of recurrent arrhythmias.
2. Heart failure: The decrease in ejection fraction from 40% to 25% indicates worsening heart function, which can lead to heart failure.
3. Fluid imbalance: The fluid balance chart shows an overall positive balance, indicating fluid overload, which can contribute to heart failure and other complications.
4. Renal dysfunction: The elevated creatinine levels (2.5-3.1 mg/dL) suggest renal impairment, which can be exacerbated by the use of nephrotoxic medications or decreased renal perfusion.
5. Coagulation abnormalities: The prolonged PT/INR values indicate a potential bleeding risk, necessitating careful consideration"

   24 Hour Events:
   A PICC line was placed and was appeared to be several centimeters into
   the R atrium.
   Pt was observed to role onto her side, and then entered into a rapid
   rhythm that may have been VTAC to begin with but was a narrow complex
   tachycardia when the MICU team arrived.
   The PICC line was pulled back and the pt received amiodarone and
   lopressor and converted back to sinus.
   Pt maintained good BPs and O2 sats throughout.
   Pt had a repeat ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2132-8-23**], biventricular systolic function is more depressed, EF =
   25%.
   Pt was started on a Lasix drip, and then given boluses of Diuril to

   ECHO [**2132-8-25**]: The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 25 %). [Intrinsic left
   ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
   severity of valvular regurgitation.] Right ventricular chamber size is
   normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal
   diastolic septal motion/position consistent with right ventricular
   volume overload. The aortic valve leaflets appear structurally normal
   with good leaflet excursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The
   mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve
   prolapse. Moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
   Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial
   effusion. Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-8-23**],
   biventricular systolic function is more depressed.
   CXR 10 /[**4-27**]: IMPRESSION: 1. Left-sided PICC withdrawn, with tip
   projecting over the mid SVC. 2. New evidence of CHF.
   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension/Shock, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end
   organ hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by
   cardiology and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of
   hypotension, possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ?
   PNA, though pt w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening
   cardiac function in the setting of recent MI, or could be
   cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] to PNA, though given ECG, MI more likely.
   -          Continue to treat PNA, given recent hospitalization prior to
   admission, pt meets criteria for HAP, abx were changed to VANC, Zosyn,
   and Azithromycin. Hypotension resolved w/ fluids and has remained
   stable in the 90s-120s. ECHO shows increased right-sided pressures,
   fluid overload. Severe tricuspid and mitral regurge suggest fluid
   overload might be worsening CO.
   -          Diuresis today
   -          Follow culture data and repeat C-diff
   -          Set up for central access and arterial monitoring to be able
   to trend CO while diuresis and prepare for CVVH
   2)       Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology, likely [**12-22**] to
   cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. Hydralazine was started without
   significant increase in UOP. Initialy fluid hydration increased SBP to
   110s-120s, but did not increase UOP, though she did initially respond
   to lasix, but then despitie mantiaing good SBP no longer resonded.
   Lasix drip was started without significant response, but some good UOP
   in response to chlorothiazide. Given more obvious cardiogenic shock,
   unlikely that renal dysfunction is secondary to hepatorenal syndrome,
   so will not start Midodrine/Octreotide.
   - Consider CVVH today to decrease volume overload and improve CO
   - Continue hydralazine
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   2.5) Tachypnea and increased WOB. Pt has been maintaining good O2 sats
   on room air up to this point, despite her  tachypnea and extensive use
   of  accessory muscles. Etiology of her tachypnea is unclear and may be
   due to a combination of her liver disease, PNA, and new CHF and fluid
   overload.
   - AM CXRs
   - Consider elective intubation as patient is somnolent and may not be
   able to protect her airway in the setting of tube feeds and poor MS.
   3)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI at that time seems likely as signs of ASMI on ECGs and echo
   showing new decreased EF and global hypokinesis since [**1-26**] . Other
   etiologies considered were PE and PNA. Pt had LE U/S with no DVT, CT-PA
   deferred for poor renal function. CEx have been stable at 0.05,0.04,
   0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**] her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          On BB for post-MI
   3.3) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall intravascular
   hypovolemia. Will treat w/ free water flushes at n250cc q4 hours w/
   TFs.
   4)       Cirrhosis and poor mental status: MS improved yesterday after
   hydration and d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible
   multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting
   of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI. Given renal failure,
   question of HRS.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider invasive CVP monitoring as above for intravascular
   status
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 yesterday, now 2.9, platelets at 42
   from 33.  Fibrinogen 66, FDP 0-10. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy.
   Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional
   process of DIC or TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest
   that unlikely to TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear,
   likely [**12-22**] liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous
   thrombocyto penia and pancytopenia.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear
   tomorrow, appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20.
   6)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   7)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   8)       FEN: NGT placed yesterday and TFs began. Free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   9)       CODE: full, needs to be confirmed w/ family

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and a previous TIPS procedure. She presented with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has been diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, likely secondary to right-sided heart failure, as indicated by increased right-sided pressures and moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation on echocardiogram. She also has moderate to severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's ejection fraction is 25%, indicating severely reduced left ventricular systolic function. The patient has been treated for pneumonia, and her antibiotic regimen has been changed to vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and azithromycin. She is receiving diuretics and has had fluid overload and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient's acute renal failure is unclear in etiology but is likely related to cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. Other potential complications include cirrhosis with poor mental status, hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and access issues."

   24 Hour Events:
   A PICC line was placed and was appeared to be several centimeters into
   the R atrium.
   Pt was observed to role onto her side, and then entered into a rapid
   rhythm that may have been VTAC to begin with but was a narrow complex
   tachycardia when the MICU team arrived.
   The PICC line was pulled back and the pt received amiodarone and
   lopressor and converted back to sinus.
   Pt maintained good BPs and O2 sats throughout.
   Pt had a repeat ECHO: Compared with the prior study (images reviewed)
   of [**2132-8-23**], biventricular systolic function is more depressed, EF =
   25%.
   Pt was started on a Lasix drip, and then given boluses of Diuril to
   which she responded with good urine output.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end organ
   hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by cardiology
   and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of hypotension,
   possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ? PNA, though pt
   w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening cardiac function in
   the setting of recent MI, or could be cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] to PNA, though
   given ECG, MI more likely.
   -          Continue to treat PNA, given recent hospitalization prior to
   admission, pt meets criteria for HAP, abx were changed to VANC, Zosyn,
   and Azithromycin.
   -          Follow culture data and repeat C-diff
   -          Hypotension resolved w/ fluids and has remained stable in
   the 90s-120s
   -          LOS fluid total is + 6-7L
   2)       Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology. On presentation FENa <
   1/% (0.3 on Saturday) suggesting pre-renal azotemia however renal
   function did not improve w/ hydration that was sufficient to bring SBPs
   to 120s and cause early pulmonary edema, however she did respond to
   lasix at that time suggesting some improved renal perfusion. Since,
   urine output has decreased and failed to respond to lasix 20mg IV x2.
   Pt appears fluid overloaded w/ end expiratory wheezes on exam, some
   increased upper extremity edema, and continued increased work of
   breathing. Hydralazine was started without significant increase in UOP.
   Overall, intravascular fluid volume is not clear.
   -          Attempted to increase renal perfusion and improve urine
   output w/ Albumin and blood product and hydralazine, will consider
   adding Dobutamine to increase CO.
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider a-line placement and noninvasive measurement of
   cardiac output w/ Vigileo versus or placement of a IJ line for CVP
   measurement and adjust IVF accordingly.
   -          Discuss CVVH or HD w/ renal
   2.5) Tachypnea and increased WOB. Pt has been maintaining good O2 sats
   on room air up to this point, despite her  tachypnea and extensive use
   of  accessory muscles. Etiology of her tachypnea is unclear and may be
   due to a combination of her liver disease, PNA, and new CHF.
   - AM CXRs
   - Consider elective intubation as patient is somnolent and may not be
   able to protect her airway in the setting of tube feeds and poor MS.
   3)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI at that time seems likely as signs of ASMI on ECGs and echo
   showing new decreased EF and global hypokinesis since [**1-26**] . Other
   etiologies considered were PE and PNA. Pt had LE U/S with no DVT, CT-PA
   deferred for poor renal function. CEx have been stable at 0.05,0.04,
   0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**] her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          On BB for post-MI
   3.3) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall hypovolemia. Will treat
   w/ free water flushes at 100cc q4 hours w/ TFs.
   -       resolved, will follow sodium
   4)       Cirrhosis and poor mental status: MS improved yesterday after
   hydration and d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible
   multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting
   of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI. Given renal failure,
   question of HRS.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider invasive CVP monitoring as above for intravascular
   status
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 yesterday, now 2.9, platelets at 42
   from 33.  Fibrinogen 66, FDP 0-10. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy.
   Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional
   process of DIC or TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest
   that unlikely to TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear,
   likely [**12-22**] liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous
   thrombocyto penia and pancytopenia.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear
   tomorrow, appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20.
   6)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   7)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   8)       FEN: NGT placed yesterday and TFs began. Free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.
   9)       CODE: full, needs to be confirmed w/ family

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and a previous TIPS procedure. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has been treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. She is experiencing tachypnea and increased work of breathing, possibly due to liver disease, pneumonia, or new-onset congestive heart failure. The patient also has hypernatremia and a history of thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia. Her mental status has improved after hydration but is still somnolent. The patient's coagulopathy is likely due to liver cirrhosis, but other causes such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS) should be considered. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely cardiogenic shock due to cardiac etiology, possibly from recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There is also a possibility of lower lobe process (possibly pneumonia), though the patient does not have increased white blood cell count or fever. The recent AMI seems more likely.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The etiology of acute renal failure is unclear. Initially, it was thought to be pre-renal azotemia,"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with hypotension (improved) in the setting of new
   systolic and valvular acute CHF, and chronic severe liver disease/HCC,
   as well as likely pneumonia.  Even after her hypotension improved, she
   still had evidence of occult hypoperfusion with ARF, altered mental
   status, and mildly elevated lactate.
   1. Hemodynamics: Acute systolic and valvular CHF, cirrhosis, and acute
   renal failure. The main challenge is trying to perfuse her kidneys
   adequately in the setting of new CHF and acute renal failure. Her
   response to volume challenge is equivocal: her UNa improved but she
   developed pulmonary edema.  Her urine output appears to have picked up
   after Lasix, rather than in response to fluids. Likely, we corrected
   her hypovolemia and allowed her to respond to Lasix. At this point, by
   exam she seems even more overloaded and we need to push to get fluid
   off. We will start Lasix drip., speak with Hpeatology about role of
   Midodrine/Octreotide, and Renal about issue of eventual HD or CVVH.
   2. Encephalopathy : Likely hepatic + toxic-metabolic.  Head CT prelim
   read negative.
   3. Pneumonia - Will broaden to vanco, zosyn, azithro.  Avoiding
   quinolones in case contritubted to encephalopathy.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with multiple health conditions, including liver disease, cardiomyopathy, and recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She was admitted to the ICU for hypotension and acute heart failure (CHF), along with chronic severe liver disease and suspected pneumonia. The patient has shown improvement in her hypotension but still exhibits signs of inadequate perfusion, such as acute renal failure and altered mental status. Her hemodynamic status is unstable, and she requires careful management of fluid balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute systolic and valvular CHF: The patient's heart failure may worsen, leading to further fluid accumulation and respiratory distress.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's kidneys are not functioning properly, which can result in electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and the need for renal replacement therapy (such as hemodialysis or continuous veno-venous hemofiltration).
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: Due to the patient's liver disease, she may experience a decline in mental status and cognitive function.
4. Pneumonia: The patient may develop complications related to the lung infection, such as sepsis or respiratory failure.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient's blood clotting ability is compromised due to liver disease, increasing the risk of bleeding or bruising.
6. Anemia: The patient may require blood transfusions to manage"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with a chief complaint of liver disease, cardiomyopathy, and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient has been admitted to the ICU and received multiple interventions, including intubation and cardioversion for recurrent SVT. The patient's vital signs are within normal ranges, with a stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. The patient has undergone hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance assessment, and various laboratory tests. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient's history of cardiomyopathy and SVT suggests an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Close monitoring of the heart rhythm is necessary to promptly identify and manage any new arrhythmias.
2. Infection: The patient is receiving multiple antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Continuous surveillance for signs of infection and appropriate antimicrobial therapy should be maintained.
3. Liver dysfunction: The patient's liver disease may lead to impaired liver function. Regular assessment of liver enzymes and monitoring for any signs of hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy is important.
4. Renal insufficiency: The elevated creatinine levels indicate a potential decline in renal function. Close monitoring of renal parameters and appropriate management, such as adjusting fluid and medication regimens, should be considered.
5. Respiratory complications: Intubation"

   68-year-old woman with hypotension (improved) in the setting of new
   systolic and valvular acute CHF, and chronic severe liver disease/HCC,

   still had evidence of occult hypoperfusion with ARF, altered mental
   status, and mildly elevated lactate.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with multiple medical conditions including liver disease, cardiomyopathy, and a recent episode of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). The patient's current presentation includes acute systolic and valvular heart failure, chronic severe liver disease with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and likely pneumonia. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature is within normal range, heart rate is stable, blood pressure is low, respiratory rate is within normal range, and oxygen saturation is good. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

Laboratory results show abnormalities such as elevated liver enzymes, low hemoglobin levels, low platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis indicates acidosis. 

The patient's assessment and plan include management of SVT, treatment for biventricular heart failure, addressing acute kidney injury (ARF), encephalopathy, anemia, and coagulopathy. The healthcare team is considering continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to unload the heart and treat ARF, as well as a femoral line placement for CVVH and right internal jugular (RIJ) line placement for central venous pressure monitoring. 

The patient's nutritional needs, glycemic control, and lines in place are being managed accordingly. Pro"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old woman with a complex medical history, including hypotension, systolic and valvular acute congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic severe liver disease/hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and likely pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU and has experienced several complications. 

Medical Complications:
1. Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): The patient has had recurrent episodes of SVT, which have required cardioversion and administration of medications such as amiodarone and beta-blockers.
2. Biventricular Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure has progressed to a dilated biventricular dysfunction, necessitating the use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) to unload the heart and improve hemodynamics.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function has deteriorated, and CVVH is being utilized to manage this condition as well.
4. Encephalopathy: The patient is likely experiencing hepatic encephalopathy, possibly exacerbated by toxic-metabolic factors. A head CT scan has shown no significant abnormalities.
5. Anemia and Coagulopathy: The patient's anemia and coagulopathy require further evaluation and management by the hematology team.

Other Issues:
The ICU team is addressing various other issues, including nutrition, glycemic control, and infection prophylaxis."

","The patient is a 66-year-old male admitted to the ICU for suspected septic shock secondary to severe pneumonia. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery disease. On admission, the patient was found to have an elevated temperature of 38.6°C (101.5°F), heart rate of 120 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure of 66 systolic mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. 

Upon arrival in the ICU, the patient was started on invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress and hypoxemia. He underwent synchronized cardioversion with 100 joules and received a bolus of amiodarone followed by a drip due to new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. An echocardiogram was performed, revealing left ventricular hypertrophy with global hypokinesis and reduced ejection fraction of 25%. 

The patient's blood glucose levels have been maintained within the normal range, and he has been receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy for his pneumonia. His central venous pressure (CVP) has been monitored and maintained at 18-22 mmHg to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's renal function has shown some decline, with an increase in serum creatinine from 0.7 mg/dL on admission to 1.3 mg/dL on day 3. His urine output has been variable, ranging from 0."

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Hypotension/Shock, likely cardiogenic shock, as clear end
   organ hypoperfusion with ARF, and ?MS change. Review of ECGs by
   cardiology and new findings on ECHO suggest cardiac etiology of
   hypotension, possibly from recent ASMI. Also, possible LLL process ?
   PNA, though pt w/o increased WBC or fever. PNA could be worsening
   cardiac function in the setting of recent MI, or could be
   cardiomyopathy [**12-22**] to PNA, though given ECG, MI more likely.
   -          Continue to treat PNA, given recent hospitalization prior to
   admission, pt meets criteria for HAP, abx were changed to VANC, Zosyn,
   and Azithromycin. Hypotension resolved w/ fluids and has remained
   stable in the 90s-120s. ECHO shows increased right-sided pressures,
   fluid overload. Severe tricuspid and mitral regurge suggest fluid
   overload might be worsening CO.
   -          Diuresis today
   -          Follow culture data and repeat C-diff
   -          Set up for central access and arterial monitoring to be able
   to trend CO while diuresis and prepare for CVVH
   2)       Acute renal failure: Unclear etiology, likely [**12-22**] to
   cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. Hydralazine was started without
   significant increase in UOP. Initialy fluid hydration increased SBP to
   110s-120s, but did not increase UOP, though she did initially respond
   to lasix, but then despitie mantiaing good SBP no longer resonded.
   Lasix drip was started without significant response, but some good UOP
   in response to chlorothiazide. Given more obvious cardiogenic shock,
   unlikely that renal dysfunction is secondary to hepatorenal syndrome,
   so will not start Midodrine/Octreotide.
   - Consider CVVH today to decrease volume overload and improve CO
   - Continue hydralazine
   - Renal following, appreciate recs
   2.5) Tachypnea and increased WOB. Pt has been maintaining good O2 sats
   on room air up to this point, despite her  tachypnea and extensive use
   of  accessory muscles. Etiology of her tachypnea is unclear and may be
   due to a combination of her liver disease, PNA, and new CHF and fluid
   overload.
   - AM CXRs
   - Consider elective intubation as patient is somnolent and may not be
   able to protect her airway in the setting of tube feeds and poor MS.
   3)       Chest pain: Limited by history, appears to have started 1 week
   prior. MI at that time seems likely as signs of ASMI on ECGs and echo
   showing new decreased EF and global hypokinesis since [**1-26**] . Other
   etiologies considered were PE and PNA. Pt had LE U/S with no DVT, CT-PA
   deferred for poor renal function. CEx have been stable at 0.05,0.04,
   0.04, and will likely remain eleveated [**12-22**] her acute renal failure.
   -          Continue to treat PNA as above.
   -          On BB for post-MI
   3.3) UTI? Cx growing gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   3.6) Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall intravascular
   hypovolemia. Will treat w/ free water flushes at n250cc q4 hours w/
   TFs.
   4)       Cirrhosis and poor mental status: MS improved yesterday after
   hydration and d/c of levofloxacin. Etiology unclear. Possible
   multifactorial w/ baseline hepatic encephalopathy worsened in setting
   of cardiogenic hypoperfusion and PNA and UTI. Given renal failure,
   question of HRS.
   -          Continue lactulose, rifaximin
   -          Treat PNA and UTI
   -          F/u on Hepatology recs
   -          Consider starting Midodrine/Octreotide for HRS
   -          Consider invasive CVP monitoring as above for intravascular
   status
   5)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 yesterday, now 2.9, platelets at 42
   from 33.  Fibrinogen 66, FDP 0-10. Unclear etiology of coagulopathy.
   Likely [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional
   process of DIC or TTP/HUS..Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest
   that unlikely to TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear,
   likely [**12-22**] liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous
   thrombocyto penia and pancytopenia.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear
   tomorrow, appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20.
   6)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   7)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   8)       FEN: NGT placed yesterday and TFs began. Free water flushes
   for hypernatremia.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and s/p TIPS. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. She has been treated for pneumonia (PNA), but the etiology of her tachypnea and increased work of breathing is unclear. The patient's chest pain appears to have started one week prior and may be due to an acute myocardial infarction (MI). She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI) and hypernatremia. Her mental status has improved after hydration and discontinuation of levofloxacin. The patient has a coagulopathy with an elevated INR and low platelet count. She has multiple lines, including a multi-lumen line and a dialysis catheter. The patient's current condition is stable, but she remains in the ICU for further management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Shock: The patient's hypotension is likely due to cardiogenic shock, possibly from recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or liver cirrhosis. Close monitoring of hemodynamic status and fluid balance is essential to prevent further hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.

2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's acute renal failure may be secondary to cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion. Diuretics and continuous renal replacement therapy (CVVH) may be necessary to manage fluid"

   Pt became tachycardic and hypotensive, w/ a narrow complex tachycardia
   yesterday morning. She was intubated,  shocked, loaded w/ amiodarone
   150mg, and returned to a sinus rhythm, she was placed on an amiodarone
   drip at 0.5.  She was remained on the amiodarone drip all day. In
   preparation for invasive monitoring, pt received 4 units of FFP and 1
   bag f platelets. She had a right IJ line placed that developed a
   moderate, but stable hematoma, and a L venous groin line placed by
   renal for CVVH. The RIJ line showed CVPs of 30-35. Several attempts
   were made at a L radial arterial line, but were not successful and a
   line was placed in the R femoral artery. The lasix drips and diuril
   boluses were dc
d in expectation of CVVH and in the evening, pt was
   started on dobutamine (of note, though written for BB, they had been
   held for >24 hours for lower than BP criteria).  During the next [**12-23**]
   hours  the CVPs tended downward to 20s, and pt maintained good SBPs and
   HR. CVVH was started and run even for 1 hour, and then volume was taken
   off, after the 2^nd hour, pt went into a tachyarrythmia at the 130s,
   that appeared to be afib w/ RVR. The dobutamine was turned off and
   carotid massage applied, and the rhythm change to ?sinus at 100, pt
   maintained SBPs in the 90s and good sats. Pt then returned to the
   140-150s and began to drop her pressures and was then shocked, and
   started on phenylephrine, and the CVVH was turned off. The pt returned
   to sinus rhythm, and stayed there during the morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Shock. Appears to be cardiogenic with ECHOs showing decreased
   LV and RV function, 3+TR and 3+MR and an EF at 25% that is likely an
   overestimate in the context of the TR and MR. Mixed picture yesterday
   with high CVPs and ECHO interpreted as clear evidence of R-sided volume
   overload, though the CVPs in the context of TR might be overestimates.
   However, the CVPs and the venous pCO2 and arterial pCO2 difference
   decrased while the pt was on dobutamine, suggesting that positive
   inotrpy was able to increase cardiac output. However, given her
   apparent arrythmogenic state likely [**12-22**] to RV failure, and the findings
   on ECHO, she appears to have a very poor prognosis and the use of
   further invasive procedures needs to be discussed with her family.
   2)       Acute renal failure. Appears to be [**12-22**] to renal hypoperfusion
   [**12-22**] cardiogenic shock. Given severe liver disease hepato renal syndrome
   may be contributing, but in the context of clear heart failure,
   treatment w/ octreotide and midodrine is not indicated. Cr actually
   improved slightly last night from 3.8 down to 3.3.
   -          Continue to trend Cr
   -          Renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Currently attempting to maximize cardiac output in order to
   improve renal perfusion.
   3)       Respiratory distress: Pt was intubated during a code for
   airway protection in the setting of clear increased work of breathing
   and unstable hemodynamics. Prior to intubation the pt had demonstrated
   significant use of accessory muscles for breathing and fluid overload
   on CXR, and elective intubation had been discussed, but deferred as she
   continued to sat in the 95-100% on RA. Currently, she remains intubated
   for the reasons above.
   4)       Cirrhosis and Altered mental status: unclear etiology of her
   altered mental status. Likely a multifactorial worsening of her
   baseline hepatic encephalopathy, possibly [**12-22**] to a LLL PNA, UTI, or
   hypoperfusion. Head CT negative., though final read has not been
   posted.
    -  Continue lactulose, rifaximin
    -  Treat PNA and UTI
           -  F/u on Hepatology recs
           - F/u Head CT final read.
   5)       Cx w/ gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   6)       Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall intravascular
   hypovolemia. Will treat w/ free water flushes at n250cc q4 hours w/
   TFs.
   7)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 this am, after 4 units of FFP
   yesterday to reverse an INR of 4.4. Etiology of coagulopathy, likely
   [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional process of
   DIC or TTP/HUS .Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest that unlikely
   to be TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear, likely [**12-22**]
   liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous thrombocytopenia
   and pancytopenia. Labs today show some increase in FDPs to 10-40 but
   also increased fibrinogen.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear,
   appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20 or bleeds acutely.
   1)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   2)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   3)       FEN: NGT in place and TFs running w/ free water flushes 250q 4
   for hypernatremia.
   4)       CODE: full, needs to be confirmed w/ family today given poor
   prognosis.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and a previous TIPS procedure. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient appears to be in cardiogenic shock with decreased left and right ventricular function, as evidenced by an ECHO showing 3+TR and 3+MR, and an EF of 25%. There is also evidence of respiratory distress, and she has been intubated. The patient's altered mental status is likely due to hepatic encephalopathy, possibly exacerbated by a lung infection, urinary tract infection, or hypoperfusion. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Shock: The patient's condition suggests cardiogenic shock, which is a serious complication characterized by insufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs. This can lead to organ damage and failure.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function has deteriorated, indicating acute renal failure. This condition can be life-threatening and may require dialysis.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory distress necessitated intubation. If not managed properly, it can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia.
4. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status may be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is a common complication of liver cirrhosis. Other factors such as infections or hypoperfusion may also"

   Assessment and Plan
   68-year-old woman with shock in setting of profound RV and LV
   dysfunction, now in and out of SVT and anuric,
   1.       Biventricular Heart Failure: At this point she is dilated
   bivent CHF, and efforts to unlad her dilated right heart with CVVH have
   been complicated by SVT and Dobutamine to try to improve forward flow
   led to SVT. Options would be Neo/Dobutmaine, and AMIo on CVVH as a
   trial. However with her multisystem organ failure we need to clarify
   goals of care with family.
   2.       SVT: recurrent this AM with atrial tach and likely Afib- Amio
   loaded, shocked back in NSR
   3.       ARF: CVVH as above was planned but cannot tolerate from
   hemodyanmics
   4.       Encephalopathy : Likely hepatic + toxic-metabolic.
   5.       Anemia: Appreciate hematology
s help, not likely TTP but poor
   liver fx and cardiac failure
   6.       Coagulopathy
 leart and liver failure and no nutrition likely

   Patient is critically ill
   MICU Attending Addendum
   Has a long meeting with pts husband, 2 sons, and brother. We reviewed
   her liver, kidney and heart failure and they felt that in light of her
   extremely poor prognosis we would move to CMO. Extubated and neo off.
   Discussed with family that this could evolve over days as she is not
   acutely hemodynamically unstable or in need of ventilatory support such
   that dehydration and renal failure may be ultimate cause of her
   decline.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 68-year-old woman with shock and profound right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. She is currently intubated and sedated in the ICU. 

The patient has undergone various interventions and procedures, including invasive ventilation, cardioversion/defibrillation, trans thoracic echo, multi-lumen placement, and dialysis catheter placement. She has also received multiple medications such as fentanyl, phenylephrine, metoprolol, midazolam, and piperacillin/tazobactam.

Her vital signs show a heart rate of 59 bpm, blood pressure of 105/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

Her laboratory results indicate anemia, coagulopathy, elevated creatinine levels, and liver function abnormalities. The patient's arterial blood gas analysis reveals respiratory acidosis with compensatory metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's physical examination shows fair air movement in the chest, bilateral upper extremity edema, and deep sedation with no response to pain. Imaging studies and additional test results are available but not provided in the given information.

The assessment and plan outline the patient's critical condition with profound RV and LV dysfunction, recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), acute renal failure ("

   Assessment and Plan
   Pt is a 66 y.o female with PMH HCV cirrhosis, HCC, s/p TIPS who
   presents with chest pain, hypotension and acute renal failure.
   1)       Shock. Appears to be cardiogenic with ECHOs showing decreased
   LV and RV function, 3+TR and 3+MR and an EF at 25% that is likely an
   overestimate in the context of the TR and MR. Mixed picture yesterday
   with high CVPs and ECHO interpreted as clear evidence of R-sided volume
   overload, though the CVPs in the context of TR might be overestimates.
   However, the CVPs and the venous pCO2 and arterial pCO2 difference
   decrased while the pt was on dobutamine, suggesting that positive
   inotrpy was able to increase cardiac output. However, given her
   apparent arrythmogenic state likely [**12-22**] to RV failure, and the findings
   on ECHO, she appears to have a very poor prognosis and the use of
   further invasive procedures needs to be discussed with her family.
   2)       Acute renal failure. Appears to be [**12-22**] to renal hypoperfusion
   [**12-22**] cardiogenic shock. Given severe liver disease hepato renal syndrome
   may be contributing, but in the context of clear heart failure,
   treatment w/ octreotide and midodrine is not indicated. Cr actually
   improved slightly last night from 3.8 down to 3.3.
   -          Continue to trend Cr
   -          Renal following, appreciate recs
   -          Currently attempting to maximize cardiac output in order to
   improve renal perfusion.
   3)       Respiratory distress: Pt was intubated during a code for
   airway protection in the setting of clear increased work of breathing
   and unstable hemodynamics. Prior to intubation the pt had demonstrated
   significant use of accessory muscles for breathing and fluid overload
   on CXR, and elective intubation had been discussed, but deferred as she
   continued to sat in the 95-100% on RA. Currently, she remains intubated
   for the reasons above.
   4)       Cirrhosis and Altered mental status: unclear etiology of her
   altered mental status. Likely a multifactorial worsening of her
   baseline hepatic encephalopathy, possibly [**12-22**] to a LLL PNA, UTI, or
   hypoperfusion. Head CT negative., though final read has not been
   posted.
    -  Continue lactulose, rifaximin
    -  Treat PNA and UTI
           -  F/u on Hepatology recs
           - F/u Head CT final read.
   5)       Cx w/ gram positive cocci ~1000/ml. Uncommon pathogen of
   urine. Well covered by Vanc/Zosyn/Azithro.
   6)       Hypernatremia. Was likely [**12-22**] to overall intravascular
   hypovolemia. Will treat w/ free water flushes at n250cc q4 hours w/
   TFs.
   7)       Coagulopathy: INR at 2.5 this am, after 4 units of FFP
   yesterday to reverse an INR of 4.4. Etiology of coagulopathy, likely
   [**12-22**] to liver chirrhosis, but could also represent additional process of
   DIC or TTP/HUS .Hematology c/s recs appreciated, suggest that unlikely
   to be TPP/HUS as has no FDPs and no schistocytes on smear, likely [**12-22**]
   liver and renal failure.  Pt has had hx of previous thrombocytopenia
   and pancytopenia. Labs today show some increase in FDPs to 10-40 but
   also increased fibrinogen.
   -          Vit K PO x 3 days completed,
   -          Hematology continues to follow will review a second smear,
   appreciate recs
   -          Will transfuse platelets if fall below 20 or bleeds acutely.
   1)       Access: PIV x2 20g
   2)       Prophylaxis:  Pneumoboots,  bowel regimine as needed,
   3)       FEN: NGT in place and TFs running w/ free water flushes 250q 4
   for hypernatremia.
   4)       CODE: full, needs to be confirmed w/ family today given poor
   prognosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and s/p TIPS. She presented with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been intubated due to respiratory distress. She is also experiencing shock, which appears to be cardiogenic with decreased LV and RV function on ECHO. There is evidence of TR and MR, and an EF of 25% that may be an overestimation. The patient has acute renal failure likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock. Her liver disease may also contribute to hepatorenal syndrome. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Shock: The patient has poor cardiac output, and further invasive procedures should be discussed with the family given her prognosis.
2) Acute renal failure: This is likely secondary to renal hypoperfusion due to cardiogenic shock. Treatment with octreotide and midodrine is not indicated.
3) Respiratory distress: The patient was intubated during a code for airway protection. She has significant use of accessory muscles for breathing and fluid overload on CXR. She remains intubated for the same reasons.
4) Cirrhosis and altered mental status: The etiology of her altered mental status is unclear. It could be worsening hepatic encephalopathy, possibly related to a lower left pulmonary nodule, urinary tract infection, or hypoperfusion.
5) Urinary tract infection: The patient has a urinary tract infection with gram-positive cocci, which is well covered by Vancomycin, Zosyn, and Azithromycin.
6) Hypernatremia: This is likely due to overall intravascular hypovolemia. The patient will be treated with free water flushes at 250cc q4 hours with TFs.
7) Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR of 2.5, which improved after receiving 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) yesterday. The etiology of the coagulopathy is likely liver cirrhosis, but it could also represent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's decreased LV and RV function on ECHO indicate cardiogenic shock, which can lead to poor cardiac output and further complications.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function is compromised, and if not managed appropriately, it could progress to chronic renal failure or end-stage renal disease.
3. Respiratory distress: The patient's respiratory status is unstable, and if not managed properly, it could lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory infections.
4. Hepatorenal syndrome: Given the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of HCV cirrhosis, HCC, and s/p TIPS. She presents with chest pain, hypotension, and acute renal failure. The patient has multi-organ system failure, decreased cardiac function, chronic liver failure, acute on chronic renal failure, and altered mental status. Invasive therapies were discontinued per the family's decision to make the patient comfort measures only (CMO).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multi-organ system failure: The patient is experiencing failure in multiple organs, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems. This can lead to further deterioration of organ function and potentially result in death.

2. Decreased cardiac function: The patient's heart is not pumping effectively, which can cause symptoms such as hypotension and fluid accumulation. This can increase the risk of heart failure, arrhythmias, and other cardiac complications.

3. Chronic liver failure: The patient's history of HCV cirrhosis and HCC indicates long-term damage to the liver. Chronic liver failure can lead to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, and portal hypertension.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient has acute renal failure on top of pre-existing chronic renal disease. This can result in fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid-base disturbances, and increased toxicity of medications due to decreased clearance.

5. Altered mental status:"

3. The patient's respiratory support consists of an endotracheal tube with continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV) mode, assisting with autoflow, tidal volume set at 450 mL, respiratory rate set at 14, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 40%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) at 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure at 18 cmH2O, and a SpO2 of 84%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values show a pH of 7.34, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 27 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 453, ventilation rate (Ve) of 6.8 L/min, and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 453.

4. The patient's physical examination reveals that they are somnolent but arousable, with dry mucous membranes, clear lungs, regular heart sounds, soft abdomen, radial pulses present bilaterally, distal pulses present bilaterally, no pedal edema, some increased upper extremity edema, and non-pitting edema on the arms and face. Neurologically, the patient is minimally responsive to voice and touch, with intact doll's eye reflex, downward toes, no asterixis, and 2+ patellar and biceps reflexes bilaterally.

5. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 27 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin (Hct) level of 24.7%, thrombocytopenia with a platelet (Plt) count of 30, elevated creatinine (Cr) levels, elevated troponin-T levels, low total carbon dioxide (TCO2) levels, elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST), elevated lactate levels, normal electrolyte levels, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).
