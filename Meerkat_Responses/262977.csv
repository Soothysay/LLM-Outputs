","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a diagnosis of Clostridium difficile colitis. She presents with fevers, increasing leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and increasing abdominal distension, which are concerning for toxic megacolon and sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2Â°C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 mmHg to 149/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is receiving various medications including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, metronidazole, morphine sulfate, and haloperidol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially met SIRS criteria with fevers, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. The source of infection is likely from the gastrointestinal tract due to C. difficile infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, maintaining adequate fluid balance, and administering appropriate antibiotics are crucial in managing sepsis.
2. Toxic Megacolon: The patient meets clinical criteria for toxic megacolon with radiographic evidence, fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, and hypotension. Surgical intervention may be necessary, but the patient's HCP has declined this option. Daily abdominal X-rays, monitoring for worsening symptoms, and continued administration of IV flagyl, PO vancomycin, and Zosyn are important in managing toxic megacolon.
3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient has a positive urinalysis, indicating a UTI. Follow-up urine culture and coverage with Zosyn, which includes coverage for gram-negative rods, should be considered.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is in the 140s, indicating hypertension. Holding antihypertensive medications for now may be appropriate due to the patient's critical illness and previous hypotension in the emergency department.
5. Alzheimer's Dementia: The patient's baseline cognitive status is unknown. Haldol can be used as needed for agitation.

Overall, the patient's condition is critical, and close monitoring and management of potential complications such as sepsis, toxic megacolon, UTI, hypertension, and dementia are necessary."

   24 Hour Events:
   overnight, patient continued to look undercomfortable, requiring larger
   boluses of IV morphine for comfort. Spoke with HCP daughter about plans
   for care. Daughter said that goals were to make patient comfortable.
   Discussed with daughter that possibility of death was imminent.
   Daughter understands. states that her brother and her were going to try
   to come in early this morning. Patient looking for comfortable now.
   Pressures have begun to drop somewhat. bolused aggressively yesterday,
   with continued low UOP. suspect that given daughter's goal of care
   aggressive bolusing is no longer warranted.  PICC came out this
   morning. As per nursing did not draw AM labs, think okay for now. will
   discuss with family this AM goals for care.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a chief complaint of toxic megacolon with likely sepsis. She is unresponsive due to Alzheimer's dementia and is currently in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show hypotension (BP: 70/33 mmHg), low respiratory rate (RR: 13 bpm), and oxygen saturation at 93% on a nasal cannula. Her temperature is slightly elevated (Tcurrent: 35.9 C). The patient has received multiple doses of antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Vancomycin, and Metronidazole. She is on continuous morphine sulfate infusion for pain management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with toxic megacolon and likely sepsis indicates a severe infection that can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Close monitoring of vital signs, laboratory parameters, and fluid balance is essential to manage sepsis effectively.

2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure (70/33 mmHg) suggests hypotension. This may be due to septic shock or inadequate fluid resuscitation. Aggressive fluid administration and hemodynamic monitoring are required to maintain adequate perfusion.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient's low respiratory rate (RR: 13 bpm) and decreased oxygen saturation ("

   24 Hour Events:
   overnight, patient continued to look undercomfortable, requiring larger
   boluses of IV morphine for comfort. Spoke with HCP daughter about plans
   for care. Daughter said that goals were to make patient comfortable.
   Discussed with daughter that possibility of death was imminent.
   Daughter understands. states that her brother and her were going to try

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female diagnosed with C. difficile colitis who presents with fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and increasing abdominal distension, concerning for toxic megacolon and sepsis. The patient's condition has worsened, and they are now unresponsive with Alzheimer's dementia. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. The patient has been aggressive in receiving IV hydration but continues to have decreased urine output. The family has declined surgical intervention, and the patient's goals of care include comfort measures only. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's presentation with fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and hypotension suggests a potential sepsis due to the C. difficile infection. 
2. Toxic Megacolon: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and radiographic evidence on CXR/AXR indicate the possibility of toxic megacolon.
3. Colonic Rupture: The loops of bowel distended to > 10 cm on admission are concerning for possible impending colonic rupture.
4. Hypotension: The patient's current state of hypotension may require further evaluation and management.
5. UTI: The patient has a positive urine analysis, indicating a potential urinary tract infection.
6. Hypertension: Although the patient was initially diagnosed with hypertension, they are currently hypotensive.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female diagnosed with C. difficile colitis who presents with fevers, leukocytosis, abdominal pain, and increasing abdominal distension. She is suspected to have toxic megacolon and sepsis. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with low blood pressure, decreased urine output, and discomfort requiring larger doses of IV morphine. The patient's family has expressed their desire to focus on comfort care, declining aggressive interventions such as surgery or central venous lines.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Colonic rupture: The patient's loops of bowel are distended to over 10 cm, which is concerning for possible impending colonic rupture.
2. Sepsis: The patient initially met SIRS criteria with fevers, leukocytosis, and tachycardia. She has radiographic evidence of infection and her blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension.
3. C. difficile infection: The patient has been diagnosed with C. difficile colitis and is being treated with antibiotics. However, the infection could continue to worsen and cause further complications.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating potential hypotension, which may lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
5. Decreased urine output: The patient's urine output is decreased, suggesting possible renal impairment or dehydration.
6. Comfort care goals: The patient's family has declined aggressive interventions and emphasized the importance"
