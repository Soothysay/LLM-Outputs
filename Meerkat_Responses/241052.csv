   play a role: levaquin is notorious, he also takes oxycodone, so
   influence of narcotics also may be at play.  Patient has mild ARF (up
   to 2.2, resolved by day after admission), so may also be a component

   #. Hypoxia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely chronic, given elevated HCO3. No
   clinical evidence of pneumonia.  CXR w/o consolidation, no symptoms of
   cough or fevers, and no leukocytosis; but is also vaguely suggestive of
   a primary pleural process (pleural plaques), possibly mesothelioma.

   #. Transient Hypotension: Resolved. The patient had one episode of
   hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures of 80. The patient
   received only 2L NS with resolution of the hypotension. Given his mild
   acute renal failure, likely this is related to hypovolemia. Dry mucous
   membranes on exam.  No clinical evidence of pneumonia by symptoms, CXR,

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of CAD, A fib, dCHF (EF 55%), PAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Unclear etiology.  No evidence of infection,
   with out pneumonia on CXR, no fevers/chills, negative UA.  Drugs may
   play a role: levaquin is notorious, he also takes oxycodone, so
   influence of narcotics also may be at play.  Patient has mild ARF (up
   to 2.2, resolved by day after admission), so may also be a component
   (increasing toxicity of neurontin). Patient is reaching for objects
   that are not there and he may be having myoclonic jerks. history of
   fall, so will hold on NCHCT.
   - hold levofloxacin
   - hold narcotics if possible
   - IVF
   - f/u blood and urine culture
   .
   #. [**Year (4 digits) **]:  Unclear etiology.  Likely chronic, given elevated HCO3. No
   clinical evidence of pneumonia.  CXR w/o consolidation, no symptoms of
   cough or fevers, and no leukocytosis; but is also vaguely suggestive of
   a primary pleural process (pleural plaques), possibly mesothelioma.
   Patient does have a history of dCHF, but no pulmonary edema on CXR,
   flat JVP, and dry MM.  PE unlikely in the absence of tachycardia, EKG
   changes.
   - ABG for AA gradient
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider chest CT to better characterize
   .
   #. Transient Hypotension: Resolved. The patient had one episode of
   hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures of 80. The patient
   received only 2L NS with resolution of the hypotension. Given his mild
   acute renal failure, likely this is related to hypovolemia. Dry mucous
   membranes on exam.  No clinical evidence of pneumonia by symptoms, CXR,
   or [**Last Name (LF) 14444**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] low suspicion of septic etiology
   - Monitor BP closely, goal MAP > 60
   - Volume resuscitation PRN with IV NS boluses
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal given volume
   depletion and hypotension.  Will check urine lytes if does not improve
   w/ IVF.
   - Volume resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat non-healing
   ulcer. Still with slowly healing ulcer, and recent follow up w/
   vascular surgery.
   - wound c/s in AM
   - cont ASA/plavix
   - pt w/ lipitor allergy.
   #. CAD: No acute process, trop mildly elevated likely secondary to
   acute on chronic renal failure. Will continue aspirin and plavix as
   above. The patient has a history of bradycardia, which is likely why he
   is not maintained on a beta blocker.  No ACS on EKG.
   #. Diastolic CHF: Preserved EF on recent echo in [**11-26**]. It appears the
   patient's ACE-I has been held since [**Month (only) **] because of falls and low
   blood pressures. Will hold lasix in the setting of acute renal failure.
   Monitor for signs of volume overload.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm. Not on rate control
   secondary to bradycardia, not on coumadin secondary to falls.
   #. History of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/uretheral stricture.
   Patient w/ indwelling foley.
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue gabapentin. hold oxycodone.

   improving. Unclear if there is a frank infiltrate and he remain AF w/o
   leukocytosis. Will repeat a cxr now that he has been hydrated.  Will
   check abg  for Co2 and A-a gradient.  A chest CT will be helpful to
   better evaluate pleura and lung parenchyma, when he can tolerate lying
   flat. Our suspicion for PE is quite low, though pt does have RFs
   including malignancy and being sedentary.  Would obtain LENIS to ro
   DVT. In terms of his AMS, this is most likely toxic metabolic with
   waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 533**] pattern, improving.  Likely multifactorial from med
   effect, with neurontin, narcotics and levoflox in setting of acute on

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AF), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), prostate cancer, bladder cancer, urethral stricture, spinal stenosis, and depression. He was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status and possible pneumonia. He is currently alert and oriented but confused, with no evidence of infection. His vital signs are stable, and he is maintaining adequate urine output. He has a large eschar on his right posterior medial heel but no surrounding erythema or fluctuance. The patient's lab results show acute renal failure, electrolyte imbalances, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. The patient's chest X-ray shows chronic changes consistent with asbestos exposure, but there is no evidence of acute infection or pulmonary edema. The patient's condition is complex and involves multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may be due to delirium, which can be caused by various factors such as medication effects, acute on chronic renal failure, or underlying infections.
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): The patient's history of smoking, asbestos exposure, and chronic CO2 retention on lab results suggest a possible diagnosis of COPD.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has risk factors for D"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, diastolic congestive heart failure (with preserved ejection fraction), peripheral arterial disease, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted to the ICU due to transient hypotension, hypoxia, altered mental status, acute on chronic renal failure, and a history of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/urethral stricture. The patient's current medications include pantoprazole, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and various other medications for his multiple medical conditions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but there are concerns about potential medical complications related to his current conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Transient Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension in the emergency department with systolic pressures of 80. This may be due to hypovolemia, especially considering the patient's mild acute renal failure. Close monitoring of blood pressure and volume resuscitation with IV normal saline boluses will be necessary to maintain a goal mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 60.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has hypoxia with an unclear etiology. There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia, and the chest X-ray shows pleural plaques. The patient's history of diastolic congestive heart failure and the flat jugular venous pressure suggest that this may be related to underlying lung disease. We"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), atrial fibrillation (AFib), decompensated heart failure (dCHF), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and a recent spinal stenosis diagnosis. The patient was admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, transient hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, and potential complications related to his medical history.

From the note, we can summarize the following potential medical complications:

1. Altered Mental Status: The patient is alert but confused, which could be due to various factors such as medication toxicity (levaquin, neurontin), narcotics, or other underlying causes.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has an unclear etiology of hypoxia, likely chronic given elevated bicarbonate levels. It may be related to a primary pleural process or mesothelioma, but further investigation is needed.

3. Transient Hypotension: The patient had one episode of hypotension that resolved with fluid resuscitation. It is likely related to hypovolemia and should be monitored closely.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient likely has prerenal acute kidney injury due to volume depletion and hypotension. Fluid resuscitation and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended.

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male with history of CAD, A fib, dCHF (EF 55%), PAD
   .
   # Altered Mental Status:  Unclear etiology.  No evidence of infection,
   with out pneumonia on CXR, no fevers/chills, negative UA.  Drugs may
   play a role: levaquin is notorious, he also takes oxycodone, so
   influence of narcotics also may be at play.  Patient has mild ARF (up
   to 2.2, resolved by day after admission), so may also be a component
   (increasing toxicity of neurontin). Patient is reaching for objects
   that are not there and he may be having myoclonic jerks. history of
   fall, so will hold on NCHCT.
   - hold levofloxacin
   - hold narcotics if possible
   - IVF
   - f/u blood and urine culture
   .
   #. Hypoxia:  Unclear etiology.  Likely chronic, given elevated HCO3. No
   clinical evidence of pneumonia.  CXR w/o consolidation, no symptoms of
   cough or fevers, and no leukocytosis; but is also vaguely suggestive of
   a primary pleural process (pleural plaques), possibly mesothelioma.
   Patient does have a history of dCHF, but no pulmonary edema on CXR,
   flat JVP, and dry MM.  PE unlikely in the absence of tachycardia, EKG
   changes.
   - ABG for AA gradient
   - wean O2 as tolerated
   - consider chest CT to better characterize
   .
   #. Transient Hypotension: Resolved. The patient had one episode of
   hypotension in the ED with systolic pressures of 80. The patient
   received only 2L NS with resolution of the hypotension. Given his mild
   acute renal failure, likely this is related to hypovolemia. Dry mucous
   membranes on exam.  No clinical evidence of pneumonia by symptoms, CXR,
   or [**Last Name (LF) 14444**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] low suspicion of septic etiology
   - Monitor BP closely, goal MAP > 60
   - Volume resuscitation PRN with IV NS boluses
   .
   #. Acute on chronic renal failure: Likely prerenal given volume
   depletion and hypotension.  Will check urine lytes if does not improve
   w/ IVF.
   - Volume resuscitation
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   #. PAD: Recent stent placement to SFA on right to treat non-healing
   ulcer. Still with slowly healing ulcer, and recent follow up w/
   vascular surgery.
   - cont ASA/plavix
   - pt w/ lipitor allergy.
   #. CAD: No acute process, trop mildly elevated likely secondary to
   acute on chronic renal failure. Will continue aspirin and plavix as
   above. The patient has a history of bradycardia, which is likely why he
   is not maintained on a beta blocker.  No ACS on EKG.
   #. Diastolic CHF: Preserved EF on recent echo in [**11-26**]. It appears the
   patient's ACE-I has been held since [**Month (only) **] because of falls and low
   blood pressures. Will hold lasix in the setting of acute renal failure.
   Monitor for signs of volume overload.
   # Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm. Not on rate control
   secondary to bradycardia, not on coumadin secondary to falls.
   #. History of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/uretheral stricture.
   Patient w/ indwelling foley.
   #. Spinal Stenosis: Continue gabapentin. hold oxycodone.
   #. Depression: Continue citalopram

","The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, decompensated heart failure (ejection fraction 55%), and peripheral arterial disease. He is currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, transient hypotension, acute on chronic renal failure, and other chronic conditions.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/51 to 135/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. He is alert but confused, with bilateral rales and prolonged expiration. He has an ulcer on his right foot and trace edema in his extremities.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.3 K/UL, hemoglobin level of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 228 K/UL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and blood glucose level of 102 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient has several medical complications, including altered mental status with unclear etiology, hypoxia with an unclear cause, transient hypotension that resolved, acute on chronic renal failure, peripheral arterial disease, coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure, atrial fibrillation, history of prostate cancer/bladder cancer/urethral"

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), renal failure, hypotension, heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), prostate cancer, depression, and pneumonia (although it is mentioned that the pneumonia may be unlikely). 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure of 131/91 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.47, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and HCO3- of 81 mEq/L. 

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, normal pupils, normocephalic head, no cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and clear breath sounds. The patient's extremities are warm and without edema. The neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented, and able to follow simple commands. 

The laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and creatinine levels, as well as slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) and potassium (K+) levels.
