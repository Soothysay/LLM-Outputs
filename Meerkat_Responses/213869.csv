   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M admitted with shock of unclear source.
   .
   # Shock: most likely septic in origin. Still requiring pressors and IVF
   (has received about 8L total).  Continues on broad spectrum abx (vanco,
   zosyn, flagyl). Can narrow as data comes back. Ischemic colitis still
   remains on differential, but no stool yet to guaiac. No gross blood per
   rectum.
   - c diff
   - urine, blood, sputum cultures
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl for empiric coverage
   - continue peripheral dopamine for now, however not ideal for >24 hrs,
   and will have to reassess goals of care if no progress by tonight.
   - IVF as tolerated by EF and respiratory status - unable to proceed
   aggressively with early goal directed therapy given no CVL, no
   intubation of volume overload.
   -guaiac stool
   - hold all antihypertensives
   .
   # ARF: likely prerenal azotemia vs. ATN. Obtain urine for lytes and
   sediment.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: continue D5
 NS today and recheck PM lytes
   .
   # Cards:
        Coronaries: elevated trop but other explanations to explain this
   besides ACS. Continue to monitor on telemetry and trend CE's. Continue
   aspirin, statin. No antihypertensives at this time given hypotension on
   pressors.
        Pump: Volume down. Given IVF as tolerated by EF and sats.
        Rhythm: paced. Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - will continue synthroid IV for now.
   .
   # Dementia: attempt to orient as much as possible. Unable to give
   namenda and mirtazapine right now given mental status. Will restart
   once more alert. Can use haldol prn for agitation.
   .
   # FEN: IVF, replete electrolytes, NPO
   .
   # Prophylaxis: Subcutaneous heparin; asp precautions
   .
   # Access: peripherals
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI, no CVL or other procedures. peripheral pressors okay
   for 24 hours.
   .
   # Communication: [**Known lastname 5802**], wife and HCP. Discussed goals with
   wife at length; decision is to make CMO if patient not going in the
   right direction, ie: maxed out on 1 pressor, SOB etc.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 90-year-old male who was admitted with shock of unclear origin.
- The patient's condition is likely septic in origin and requires pressors and IV fluids.
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, metronidazole) have been initiated.
- Ischemic colitis is still a differential diagnosis, but stool cultures have not been obtained yet.
- Cultures for urine, blood, and sputum are pending.
- The patient is currently receiving dopamine for hemodynamic support.
- The patient's renal function is compromised, with elevated BUN and creatinine levels.
- Hypernatremia has been noted, and the patient is receiving D5 0.9% normal saline.
- Coronary artery disease is present, but other causes for elevated cardiac markers are being considered.
- The patient's rhythm is paced, and he is being monitored on telemetry.
- Hypothyroidism is present, and the patient is receiving IV levothyroxine.
- Dementia is also present, and efforts are being made to orient the patient.
- The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status, with a decision to pursue comfort measures only (CMO) if the patient does not improve.
- The patient's access lines are peripheral, and communication has been made with the wife and healthcare provider.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:
1. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, indicating a concern for an ongoing or potential infection. Cultures are pending to identify the causative organism.
2. Ischemic colitis: Given the patient's age and symptoms, ischemic colitis remains a differential diagnosis and should be further investigated.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest possible renal dysfunction, which could progress to AKI if not addressed promptly.
4. Cardiac complications: The presence of coronary artery disease and elevated cardiac markers may indicate ongoing myocardial injury or other cardiac complications.
5. Electrolyte imbalance: Hypernatremia has been noted, and careful monitoring of electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further imbalances.
6. Pressure injuries: Due to the patient's immobility and the use of pressors, there is a risk of developing pressure injuries, especially in areas of increased pressure.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, lab results, and clinical symptoms to address these potential complications promptly."

   remains on differential, but no stool yet to guaiac. No gross blood per
   rectum.
   - c diff
   - urine, blood, sputum cultures

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: Mr [**Known lastname **] presents with septic shock and
   concerns regarding a abdominal source ( Abd CT with features of
   colitis) . He has responded to IVF ( nearly 7.5L thus far) and moderate
   range dopamine ( 8 microgms/ kg/[**Known lastname 83**]) overnight. he is now more
   responsive and can take PO meds.
   Exam notable for elderly frail male in minimal resp distress not using
   accessory muscles. He has decreased breath sounds at bases,  tympanitic
   abdomen with mild tenderness to palpation. .
   Tm of 97.6 BP of 105/60 ( on dopa) HR 70 RR 15-18 with satsof 95% on
   3lpm O2.
    Labs notable for WBC of 8.K, HCT of 27.3 , K+ of 4.5 , Cr of 1.9 (
   2.9), BUN of 45 and trop of 0.12, lactate is now 1.4. CXR with ?
   atelectasis at left base. EKG is V paced.
   Agree with plan to rescucitate with 1 unpRBC's, IVF's and wean dopamine
   today. We will continue broad Abx for 'colitis' and obtain stool
   cultures when available.  His family is very clear regarding ovreall
   goals of care and if he should still be pressor dependent tonite, we
   will speak regarding institution of comfort measures given overall
   decline and significant co-morbidity.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted with shock of unclear origin.
- He received a reduced dose of dopamine and was given Haldol for agitation.
- The patient has been receiving IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.4°C, blood pressure of 103/52 mmHg, heart rate of 72 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient's physical examination shows a left surgical pupil, right pupil reactive and regular, clear lungs, faint heart sounds, and increased tone with difficulty opening eyes.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, high potassium levels, and normal creatinine levels.
- The patient's urine output is 600 mL and blood products have been transfused.
- The patient is on pressors, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics.
- The plan includes continuing dopamine, IV fluids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics, obtaining urine and blood cultures, and monitoring for ischemic colitis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's initial presentation with shock of unclear origin suggests the possibility of septic shock. The ongoing administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is appropriate, and the source of infection needs to be identified and treated promptly.
2. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's symptoms and abdominal CT findings raise concerns about ischemic"

   # Shock: Could be either septic, cardiogenic or a mixed picture.
   Fevers, leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis raise concern for septic
   shock, but currently no clear source and lactate 1.4. UA essentially
   negative for infection, otherwise CXR is unremarkable and blood cx are
   pending. Only source so far is ascending colitis seen on CT abd/pelvis
   on reconstructions. No risk factors for c diff, but CACD is still
   possible. Ischemic colitis also possible, but pain is not out of
   proportion to exam and no blood in stool. Cardiogenic shock is also on
   the differential. Trops are elevated but this could also be in the
   setting of ?sepsis and arf. He does have a history of heart disease s/p
   CABG, and didn't do well on levophed, which suggests that he needed
   more inotropy. EKG is paced. Second set of enzymes trending down with
   IVF. Per discussion with HCP, will not initiate another pressor if
   maxed on dopa.

   - medical management for ?ACS - no cath
   - IVF as tolerated by EF and respiratory status - unable to proceed

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted with shock of unclear source. There are concerns for septic shock, cardiogenic shock, or a mixed picture. The patient has fevers, leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis, but no clear source of infection. Lactate levels are elevated, and the patient has a history of heart disease with previous CABG surgery. The patient is currently on dopamine for support and has been experiencing agitation, for which he received haloperidol. The patient's urine output has been low, and there may be a possibility of urinary tract infection or acute kidney injury. The patient also has hypernatremia and requires further evaluation. Other conditions such as ischemic colitis, Clostridium difficile infection, and acute coronary syndrome are being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Septic shock: The patient's symptoms, including fever and leukocytosis, raise concerns for septic shock. The source of infection has not been identified yet.
2. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of heart disease and previous CABG surgery, cardiogenic shock is also a possibility.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The patient's low urine output and elevated creatinine levels suggest the possibility of AKI.

","The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted with shock of unclear source. The patient is still requiring pressors and IV fluids (has received about 8L total). The patient continues on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, metronidazole). The differential diagnosis includes ischemic colitis, sepsis, and possible cardiac issues. The patient has limited peripheral pulses, and his skin and neurologic examination is not assessed.

The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, hemoglobin, and platelets, as well as increased creatinine and lactic acid levels. The patient has hypernatremia and hypomagnesemia. Imaging shows wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding at the distal descending colon/sigmoid, which could result from colitis or diverticulitis. There is also a mention of a left renal cyst that should be evaluated further with a US.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/50 to 126/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on dopamine for hemodynamic support and has received a unit of packed red blood cells and 5 liters of IV fluids. The patient's urine output is 2,060 mL since 12 AM.

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock of unclear origin. He requires dopamine for blood pressure support and has received blood products and IV fluids. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and metronidazole. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, with the exception of sepsis. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 53 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/50 to 126/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with an ABG showing pH 7.20. Physical examination findings are limited due to the patient's unresponsive state.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Colitis: The patient's CT scan shows wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding at the distal descending colon/sigmoid, which could indicate colitis or diverticulitis. This may progress to ischemic colitis if not promptly addressed.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has a high lactate level of 1.5 mmol/L, elevated creatinine levels, and decreased urine output. These findings suggest possible AKI, which could be due to septic shock or pre-renal az"

   Assessment and Plan
   [**Age over 90 **] yo M admitted with shock of unclear source.
   .
   # Shock: most likely septic in origin.  Off of pressures.   Unclear
   source.  Cultures NGTD.  Continues on broad spectrum abx (vanco, zosyn,
   flagyl). Can narrow as data comes back.  She also has ? colitis on CT
   abd/pelvis with unequivocal c diff test.  Will switch flagyl to PO.
   Unlikely cause of this for transient septic shock.  Ischemic colitis
   still remains lower on the differential, but no gross blood per rectum.
   - resend c diff
   - follow up urine, blood, sputum cultures
   - continue vanco/zosyn/flagyl for empiric coverage for 72 hours unless
   cultures turn positive
   - switch flagyl to oral after speech and swallow eval
   - IVF as needed
   -guaiac stool
   - hold all antihypertensives
   .
   # ARF: likely prerenal azotemia vs. ATN. Improved with IVF.
   .
   # Hypernatremia: continue D5
 NS today and recheck PM lytes
   .
   # Cards:
        Coronaries: elevated trop but other explanations to explain this
   besides ACS. Continue to monitor on telemetry and trend CE's. Continue
   aspirin, statin. No antihypertensives at this time given hypotension on
   pressors.
        Pump: Volume down. Given IVF as tolerated by EF and sats.
        Rhythm: paced. Monitor on telemetry.
   .
   # Decreased cell counts:  Most likely dilutional due to 5L IVF
   yesterday.
   -          will recheck pm HCT
   -          - guaic all stools
   .
   # Hypothyroidism - will continue synthroid IV for now.
   .
   # Dementia: attempt to orient as much as possible. Unable to give
   namenda and mirtazapine right now given mental status. Will restart
   once more alert. Can use haldol prn for agitation.
   .
   # Elevated PTT with subq heparin:  Upto 120s.  Will check LFTs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 90-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shock of unclear origin. The most likely cause of shock appears to be septic in nature, and the patient is currently receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cultures have been obtained, and the patient's condition is being closely monitored.

The patient has a history of colitis, as indicated by wall thickening and pericolonic fat stranding in the distal descending colon/sigmoid on a CT abdomen/pelvis. This finding could be due to colitis or diverticulitis, and further correlation with a colonoscopy or follow-up imaging after treatment is recommended to exclude an underlying neoplasm. An equivocal Clostridium difficile (C. diff) test has also been obtained.

Other assessments and plans include acute renal failure (ARF), hypernatremia, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), decreased cell counts, hypothyroidism, dementia, elevated prothrombin time (PTT), and femoral nerve palsy (FEN). The patient has a do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) status, with a decision to provide comfort measures only (CMO) if the patient does not show improvement.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Septic shock: The patient's condition can deteriorate if the source of infection is not identified and treated promptly.
2. Colitis: If"

","Summary:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of sepsis from an unknown source. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill. The patient's medical history includes dementia, renal failure, altered mental status, hypernatremia, and sepsis without organ dysfunction. The patient is on multiple medications, including Vanc, Zosyn, and Flagyl for colitis. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 133/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's lab results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, elevated creatinine levels, and low platelet count. Imaging shows colitis on CT scan. The patient's current assessment includes sepsis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, renal failure, and hypernatremia. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient already has sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially result in septic shock if not properly managed.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications.
3. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin level may indicate anemia, which can cause fatigue and weakness.
