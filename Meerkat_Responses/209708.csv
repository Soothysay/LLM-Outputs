","The patient is a 39-year-old female who presented from Hospital1 with seizures, right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She has a history of preeclampsia with severe features (PIH) and was 3 weeks postpartum at the time of presentation. 

The patient's current medications include levofloxacin, famotidine, and heparin. She has been treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for MSSA infection. Her blood pressure is being managed with labetalol and nifedipine to maintain a goal of less than 160/90 mmHg. 

The patient has an ongoing urinary tract infection (UTI) due to Klebsiella, which is covered by levofloxacin and will be treated for a total of 7 days. She also has a history of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) associated with eclampsia. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 136/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. Her ABG results show a pH of 7.40, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 345 mmHg, and respiratory system compliance of 50 cmH2O/mL. 

The patient's physical examination reveals that she is well-nourished, overweight/obese, and in no acute distress. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, and her peripheral pulses are present and equal bilaterally. Her respiratory/chest examination shows symmetric expansion and clear breath sounds without wheezes. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 9.3 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL, platelet count of 293 K/uL, sodium level of 135 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, glucose level of 82 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 28 mg/dL. Blood cultures grew MSSA, and her urine culture grew Klebsiella. 

The patient's plan includes continuing levofloxacin, providing ventilator precautions, and attempting extubation today. Her blood pressure will be managed with labetalol and nifedipine, and she will be monitored for hypertension and eclampsia. She will also be consulted with neurology regarding PRES and will continue to treat hypertension. Additionally, she will be treated for urinary tract infection, and her feeds will be held with a plan of extubation tomorrow."

   39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum presents
   from [**Hospital1 403**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
   1) Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate:
   This likely represents an aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure and
   intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew MSSA. Initially treated with
   clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3 days. Now on levofloxacin.
   Secretions are inhibiting the ability to wean off the ventilator.
   -Continue levofloxacin
   -Vent precautions
   -Plan to attempt extubation today
   -Secondary to cardiomegaly on CXR today, will get echocardiogram to
   assess cardiac function
   2) Hypertension/Eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90.
   - Will manage the blood pressure with labetalol 600mg TID and
   nifedipine 20mg TID.
   3) PRES:
   Brain MRI at [**Hospital1 403**] revealed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome,
   which is associated with eclampsia, particularly after delivery.
   - Will consult neurology for additional recommendations and to provide
   patient will follow up contact.
   - Will continue to treat hypertension.
   4) Urinary Tract Infection:

   1) Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate:
   No clear infiltrate on radiograph this morning. Extubation attempted
   yesterday, although re-intubated likely secondary to upper airway
   swelling. Initial distress may have been due to aspiration pneumonia
   secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew MSSA.
   Initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3 days. Now
   on levofloxacin. Secretions are inhibiting the ability to wean off the
   ventilator.
   - Continue levofloxacin given considerable improvement on antibiotics
   - Vent precautions
   - Hold off on extubation for 1-2 days to allow laryngeal swelling to
   reduce; prior to next extubation attempt may need to pretreat with
   steroids
   2) Hypertension/Eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90.
   - Will manage the blood pressure with labetalol 600mg TID and
   nifedipine 20mg TID.
   - Ob/gyn recs
   3) Double vision, decreased R-sided strength - Brain MRI at [**Hospital1 403**]
   revealed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome, which is
   associated with eclampsia, particularly after delivery. Repeat MRI here
   with results pending. PRES vs. CVA vs ?. Neurology involved
   - Continue close monitoring of neurologic status
   - Neurology recs
   - Will continue to treat hypertension.
   4) Urinary Tract Infection: UA clean, though urine culture at [**Hospital1 403**] grew
   Klebsiella. This is covered by levofloxacin; will treat for total of 7
   days.
   - Continue levofloxacin

   Assessment and Plan
   39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum presents
   from [**Hospital1 403**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
    1) Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate:
   No clear infiltrate on radiograph this morning. Extubation attempted
   yesterday, although re-intubated likely secondary to upper airway
   swelling. Initial distress may have been due to aspiration pneumonia
   secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew MSSA.
   Initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3 days. Now
   on levofloxacin. Secretions are inhibiting the ability to wean off the
   ventilator.
   - Continue levofloxacin given considerable improvement on antibiotics
   - Vent precautions
   - Hold off on extubation for 1-2 days to allow laryngeal swelling to
   reduce; prior to next extubation attempt may need to pretreat with
   steroids
   2) Hypertension/Eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90.
   - Will manage the blood pressure with labetalol 600mg TID and
   nifedipine 20mg TID.
   - Ob/gyn recs
   3) Double vision, decreased R-sided strength - Brain MRI at [**Hospital1 403**]
   revealed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome, which is
   associated with eclampsia, particularly after delivery. Repeat MRI here
   with results pending. PRES vs. CVA vs ?. Neurology involved
   - Continue close monitoring of neurologic status
   - Neurology recs
   - Will continue to treat hypertension.
   4) Urinary Tract Infection: UA clean, though urine culture at [**Hospital1 403**] grew
   Klebsiella. This is covered by levofloxacin; will treat for total of 7
   days.
   - Continue levofloxacin
   5) FEN:
   Patient has OG tube in place. She received tube feeds at [**Hospital1 403**]. Will hold
   tube feeds with plan of extubating tomorrow. Euvolemic. Does not need
   additional fluids. Replete lytes prn.
   - Restart tubefeeds as she will not be extubated for 1-2 days.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old female who presented with seizures, right upper lobe infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She has a history of preeclampsia and is 3 weeks postpartum. The patient was initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for suspected aspiration pneumonia, but now she is on levofloxacin. She has been intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to secretions and inability to wean off the ventilator.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate: The patient's initial distress may have been due to aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation. She is currently on levofloxacin, but her secretions are still inhibiting the ability to wean off the ventilator. Ventilation precautions and steroids may be needed prior to next extubation attempt.

2. Hypertension/Eclampsia: The patient has a past history of pregnancy complicated by hypertension. She had tonic-clonic seizures likely related to her pregnancy. Her blood pressure goal is less than 160/90. She will be managed with labetalol and nifedipine.

3. Double vision, decreased R-sided strength: The patient's brain MRI revealed Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES), which is associated with eclampsia, particularly after delivery. Repeat MRI results are pending. Close monitoring of neurologic status is recommended"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old female who presented with seizures, right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate, and respiratory distress. The patient has a history of preeclampsia and is currently in the postpartum period. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given include:

1. Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate: The patient initially had respiratory distress and RUL infiltrate. Although there was no clear infiltrate on the chest radiograph for a few days, the patient required reintubation due to upper airway swelling. This suggests the possibility of aspiration pneumonia secondary to the seizure and intubation. The sputum grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and the patient was treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for a total of 3 days before being placed on levofloxacin. 

2. Hypertension/eclampsia: The patient has a past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension. She experienced tonic-clonic seizures likely related to her pregnancy and is currently being managed with labetalol and nifedipine to control blood pressure. 

3. Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): The patient's MRI showed white matter changes, which could be a manifestation of PRES, especially considering her history of eclampsia after delivery.

   Assessment and Plan
   39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum presents
   from [**Hospital1 403**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
    1) Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate:
   No clear infiltrate on chest radiograph for past few days. Extubation
   attempted [**2152-10-29**], although re-intubated likely secondary to upper
   airway swelling. Initial distress may have been due to aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew
   MSSA. Initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3
   days. Completed 7 day course of levofloxacin 750mg PO daily on [**2152-10-29**].
   - Vent precautions
   - Hold off on extubation for additional 1 day to allow laryngeal
   swelling to reduce, increase likelihood of successful extubation
   2) Hypertension/eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90. On [**2152-10-29**] labetalol
   dose increased for systolic BP>160.
   - Continue labetalol 700mg TID
   - Continue nifedipine 20mg TID
   - Hydralazine 10mg IV prn systolic BP>160
   - Ob/gyn recs
   3) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome - Associated with
   eclampsia, particularly after delivery. White matter changes reported
   in MRI on [**10-3**] be PRES manifestation.
   - Continue close monitoring of neurologic status
   - Neurology recs
   - Continue to treat hypertension
   4) Urinary Tract Infection, now resolved: UA clean, though urine
   culture at [**Hospital1 403**] grew Klebsiella. Seven day levofloxacin course
   completed.
   5) FEN:
   Patient has OG tube in place
 TF restarted [**2152-10-29**]. Replete lytes prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of PIH (pre-eclampsia with severe features) who presented from Hospital1 with seizures, right upper lobe (RUL) infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to unsuccessful extubation attempts. The patient has a past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension, and her most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks postpartum, she experienced tonic-clonic seizures, which were likely related to her pregnancy. The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, and she is being treated with labetalol and nifedipine. She also has a history of urinary tract infection (UTI), now resolved, and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) associated with eclampsia, as indicated by white matter changes seen on MRI. The patient is currently receiving tube feeds, and her code status is full code. She is being closely monitored for any changes in neurologic status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress/RUL Infiltrate: The patient's initial distress may have been due to aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew MSSA, and she was treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for three days. She completed a seven-day course of levofloxacin. She is currently on ventila"

   Assessment and Plan
   39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum presents
   from [**Hospital1 403**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
    1) Respiratory Distress:
   No clear infiltrate on chest radiograph for past few days. Extubation
   attempted [**2152-10-29**], although re-intubated likely secondary to upper
   airway swelling. Initial distress may have been due to aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew
   MSSA. Initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3
   days. Completed 5 day course of levofloxacin 750mg PO daily on [**2152-10-29**].
   Given no indication of active infection at this time (afebrile, normal
   WBC count, no infiltrate on radiograph), will not given any antibiotics
   at this time.
   - Vent precautions
   - Hold off on extubation for additional 1 day to allow laryngeal
   swelling to reduce, increase likelihood of successful extubation
   2) Hypertension/eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90. On [**2152-10-29**] labetalol
   dose increased for systolic BP>160.
   - Continue labetalol 700mg TID
   - Continue nifedipine 20mg TID
   - Hydralazine 10mg IV prn systolic BP>160
   - Ob/gyn recs
   3) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome - Associated with
   eclampsia, particularly after delivery. White matter changes reported
   in MRI on [**2152-10-27**] be PRES manifestation.
   - Continue close monitoring of neurologic status
   - Neurology recs
 when repeat MRI?
   - Continue to treat hypertension
   4) Dysuria
 [**10-27**] urine culture with no growth. Patient recently
   treated for UTI (Klebsiella) diagnosed at [**Hospital1 403**].
   - Urine culture, UA

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of preeclampsia and postpartum onset. She presented from Hospital1 with seizures, right upper lobe infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She was initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for aspiration pneumonia but completed a 5-day course of levofloxacin on 10/29/2152. She is currently on ventilator support due to persistent respiratory distress. Her blood pressure is under better control after increasing the dose of labetalol. The patient's neurologic status is being closely monitored for PRES, and she is being treated for hypertension. She also has dysuria and a history of UTI but no growth on recent urine culture. She has an OG tube in place, and TF has been restarted. She is also being treated for a DVT with heparin SC TID and an ulcer with famotidine. The patient is currently on full code status and will remain in the ICU until extubated and stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient may continue to experience respiratory distress due to aspiration pneumonia, which may lead to further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Hypertension/Eclampsia: The patient has a history of hypertension during pregnancy and recently experienced seizures likely related to eclampsia. There is a risk of recurrent seizures or"

   39 year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum presents
   from [**Hospital1 403**] with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress.
    1) Respiratory Distress:
   No clear infiltrate on chest radiograph for past few days. Extubation
   attempted [**2152-10-29**], although re-intubated likely secondary to upper
   airway swelling. Initial distress may have been due to aspiration
   pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation at the OSH. Sputum grew
   MSSA. Initially treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone, overall 3
   days. Completed 5 day course of levofloxacin 750mg PO daily on [**2152-10-29**].
   Given no indication of active infection at this time (afebrile, normal
   WBC count, no infiltrate on radiograph), will not given any antibiotics
   at this time.
   - Vent precautions
   - Bronchoscopy this morning to evaluate trachea; if no swelling, will
   plan to extubate today
   2) Hypertension/eclampsia:
   Patient has past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension.
   The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress. Two weeks
   postpartum patient had tonic clonic seizures, likely related to her
   pregnancy. Discussed with Ob/Gyn. BP goal <160/90. On [**2152-10-29**] labetalol
   dose increased for systolic BP>160.
   - Continue labetalol 700mg TID
   - Continue nifedipine 20mg TID
   - Hydralazine 10mg IV prn systolic BP>160
   - Ob/gyn recs
   3) Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome - Associated with
   eclampsia, particularly after delivery. White matter changes reported
   in MRI on [**2152-10-27**] be PRES manifestation.

","The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of PIH, 3 weeks postpartum, presenting from Hospital1 with seizures, RUL infiltrate, and respiratory distress. The patient had been admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of eclampsia and was treated with magnesium sulfate. She developed respiratory distress and was intubated on day 2. The patient has a history of hypertension and had a recent pregnancy complicated by hypertension. She also had a urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosed at Hospital1 and was treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially had an upper airway swelling and required re-intubation. The initial distress may have been due to aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure and intubation. Sputum grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She was treated with clindamycin and ceftriaxone for 3 days and completed a 5-day course of levofloxacin. Currently, there is no indication of active infection, so no antibiotics will be given at this time. Ventilation precautions are in place, and a bronchoscopy will be performed this morning to evaluate the trachea. If no swelling is observed, the plan is to extubate today.

The patient has a past history of a pregnancy complicated by hypertension and experienced tonic clonic seizures two weeks postpartum. The patient's current condition includes respiratory distress, hypertension/eclampsia, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), dysuria, feeding tube, and an ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and previous attempts at extubation due to upper airway swelling indicate a risk of respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Infection: Although the patient has completed a course of antibiotics for aspiration pneumonia, the presence of MSSA in sputum and the need for further evaluation through bronchoscopy may suggest a risk of infection.
3. Hypertensive crisis: The patient's history of PIH and induced labor for fetal distress, along with ongoing hypertension, increase the risk of hypertensive crisis. Close monitoring and adherence to antihypertensive therapy are necessary to prevent complications such as stroke or cardiac events.
4. PRES: The patient's MRI findings suggestive of PRES, associated with eclampsia, require close neurologic monitoring to prevent further neurological deterioration.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of PIH (preeclampsia) who presented from Hospital1 with seizures, right upper lobe infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She is currently in the ICU and has been treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia and MSSA infection. The patient had an induced pregnancy for fetal distress and experienced tonic-clonic seizures postpartum. Her blood pressure goal is less than 160/90, and she is currently on labetalol and nifedipine. She also has a diagnosis of PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) associated with eclampsia. The patient's dysuria has resolved, and her urinary tract infection has cleared. She is cleared to advance her diet as tolerated and has replete electrolytes. She is also being treated for a DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis. Her code status is full code, and she is to be dispositioned to ob/gyn for further evaluation.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient initially presented with respiratory distress, which required intubation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of recurrent respiratory distress or worsening of the existing condition.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated for suspected aspiration pneumonia and MSSA infection. There is a potential for new infections due to immunosuppression or inadequate antibiotic coverage.
3. Hypertension/eclampsia: The patient has a history of PI"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of PIH (preeclampsia), currently 3 weeks postpartum. She presented to the hospital with seizures, right upper lobe infiltrate, and respiratory distress. She was intubated and received antibiotics for suspected aspiration pneumonia secondary to seizure/intubation and MSSA (methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus) that grew out of the sputum culture. She has a past history of pregnancy complicated by hypertension. The most recent pregnancy was induced for fetal distress, and two weeks postpartum, she experienced tonic-clonic seizures, likely related to her pregnancy. Her blood pressure goal is less than 160/90, and she is being treated with labetalol and nifedipine.
