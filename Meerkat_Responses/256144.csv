   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG (7.37, 50, 20), Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.
   ICU Care
   Nutrition: PO cardiac diet as tolerated
   Glycemic Control: None
   Lines: PIV x 2
   Prophylaxis:
   DVT: : Heparin SQ TID
   Stress ulcer: Not on PPI at home, though should be while on high dose
   steroids
   Communication:  [**Doctor First Name 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband
   does not answer the phone regularly)
   Code status:  DNR/DNI. We discussed at length how patient
s chances of
   coming off the ventilator would be very low. She has had discussed her
   wishes at length with her family, as she would not want measures to
   prolong
the inevitable.
   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is worsening, indicating a decline in lung function. This could be due to underlying lung malignancy, pneumonia, or post-obstructive pneumonia.

2. Multifocal pneumonia: The CT chest findings suggest worsening disease and multifocal pneumonia, which can lead to further respiratory distress and complications.

3. Cardiac event: The patient's hypotension and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR) may be indicative of a cardiac event. Poor forward flow without atrial kick can result in poor perfusion and subsequent organ dysfunction.

4. Sepsis: Although the patient does not exhibit signs of sepsis currently, the presence of infection (pneumonia) can increase the risk of developing septic shock, especially if the infection worsens or spreads.

5. Adrenal insufficiency: Chronic use of steroids for polymyalgia rheumatica treatment may mask symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. If the steroid dose is reduced or discontinued, the patient may experience an adrenal crisis.

6. Coronary artery disease: Although cardiac enzymes are negative, the patient has a history of coronary artery disease. Ischemic heart disease can still present with atypical chest discomfort or pain.

7. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's anemia could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly if there are"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u cultures,
   continue levoflox.
   COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   Goal sats 90-94%.
   Will hold off diuresis in setting
   Will check
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Will be on increased steroids for ? amio
   toxicity.
   #) Coronary artery disease: CE
s neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   The preliminary report demonstrated multi-focal pneumonia, though she
   has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this; a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could remain more
   clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung malignancy also
   could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would not expect this
   to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A primary cardiac
   event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is a possibility,
   but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax. Could also have
   exacerbation of COPD.
   - Trend lactate, VBG, Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Continue levofloxacin given low risk for HAP and clinically no fever,
   leukocytosis, or sputum production (though she is on steroids
   chronically)
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful for COPD component
 can hold in
   setting of afib. Continue PO steroids.
   - Checking BNP 3075 without prior for comparison. Would consider gentle
   diuresis today as BP allows to reverse componenet of flash pulmonary
   edema.
   - Cardiac enzymes neg, TropT peaked at 0.03 on admission.
   - EKG unchanged from baseline once in NSR
   - Given lack of improvement and persisent dependence on non-rebreather,
   will discuss checking TTE for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Questionable contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone although reverted back into afib at rates in
   120s.
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, but now is again in Afib RVR,
   asymptomatic, unchanged O2 requirement.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

","Summary of Progress Note:

Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**], a 69-year-old female with a history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, is admitted to the ICU with acute on chronic respiratory failure. The CT chest reveals worsening disease and multifocal pneumonia. She has been requiring nonrebreather due to hypoxia.

The patient has allergies to Lipitor and Zocor, both causing muscle aching. She is currently receiving medications such as Lansoprazole, Heparin Sodium (for prophylaxis), and others as per the ICU treatment plan.

Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.2°F), heart rate of 122 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 117/60 to 129/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nonrebreather. Her rhythm is atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals a pleasant female appearance, comfortable and speaking full sentences with minimal effort. She has moist mucous membranes, pupils equal and reactive, no scleral icterus or conjunctival pallor. The neck is supple, but the left supraclavicular area shows an ill-defined mass that is non-tender. Decreased breath sounds over the left base with rales present up to 1/4 of the lung field, scattered wheezes upon expiration, bronchial breath sounds"

   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   - Will likely involve IP and consider bronchoscopy and palliative
   stenting, if appropriate, to help with possible post-obstructive
   pneumonia
 however unclear if  opening obstruction in one area will be
   sufficient change to improve her resp status.
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid taper per outpt regimen. No
   signs of adrenal insufficiency
   #) Coronary artery disease: Ces neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

s chances of
   coming off the ventilator would be very low. She has had discussed her
   wishes at length with her family, as she would not want measures to

the inevitable.
   Disposition: ICU level care until respiratory status and blood pressure
   more stable
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Acute on chronic respiratory failure: The patient presents with acute respiratory failure on top of chronic respiratory issues. This could be due to worsening underlying lung malignancy, multifocal pneumonia, post-obstructive pneumonia, or exacerbation of COPD.

2. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR): The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. However, she missed last few doses and is now presenting with AFib with RVR. It is important to control the heart rate and maintain sinus rhythm.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, which could be due to poor forward flow from AFib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone, and hypovolemia. Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.

4. Anemia: The patient's baseline hemoglobin level is in the mid-20s, and it has further dropped since admission. This could be due to dilution from fluid administration or other underlying causes. Further investigation is required to determine the cause and whether a transfusion is necessary.

5. Squamous cell lung carcinoma: The patient has a known history of squamous cell lung carcinoma. Her CT scan shows worsening pulmonary disease, indicating possible progression of the cancer. Further evaluation by the oncology team is warranted"

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with acute
   on chronic respiratory failure, with CT chest concerning for worsening
   disease and multifocal pneumonia.
   #) Dyspnea/Hypoxia: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large
   component was secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor
   forward flow without atrial kick (discussed below) with some backup
   into the lungs, coupled with poor lung reserve based on CT findings.
   Imaging findings have worsened significantly in last few months, with
   almost normal CXR/CT in the fall. This timing narrows differential to
   aggressive inflammatory lung malignancy, PCP (in setting of elevated
   LDH) or amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Although prelim read of CT
   suggests multifocal pneumonia, clinically this is unlikely given no
   fever, no leukocytosis and no cough. A primary cardiac event is
   unlikely given neg trop, PE ruled out by CTA, and PTX ruled out with
   CXR. Unlikely exacerbation of COPD as imaging and exam suggests
   alveolar disease rather than broncheolar.
   Denies hemoptysis, making alveolar hemorrhage unlikely.
   - get induced sputum today for PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] plan for BAL tomorrow by IP to eval for PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] unable to induce
   sputum, can get sample at that time.
   - cells/biopsy on BAL to also evaluate for amiodarone induced toxicity
   - if PCP will need Bactrim therapy, not starting empirically
   - if amiodarone induced toxicity will need high dose steroids and
   stopping of amio.  For now continue amio and start high dose PO
   steroids, up from current dose of 10mg for PMR
   - will consult cardiology regarding other potential afib therapy given
   previous difficulty with rate control.
   - Although very low likelihood of infectious etiology, will f/u
   cultures, continue levoflox.
   - COPD exacerbation unlikely so nebs not necessary. Will be getting PO
   steroids anyway.
   - Goal sats 90-94%.
   - Will hold off diuresis today as congestion will likely improve with
   or without diuresis with improved HR.
   - Will check TTE today for new WMA, valvular defects or strain.
   #) Hypotension: Improved with return to NSR and IVF.
   Etiology likely multifactorial with contribution from poor forward flow
   from Afib with RVR, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose,
   and poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Unlikely contribution of
   sepsis from infection, adrenal insufficiency
 as afebrile, no
   leukocytosis or secretions, and appropriate cortisol level of 40s.
   Other less likely possibilities include cardiac event (Ces neg, EKG
   unchanged), pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT (though no
   pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - Lactate improved from 2.7 to 1.5 with IVF, making decent urine volume
   - Does not need stress dose steroids but will be getting increased dose
   for ? amiodarone toxicity
   - Does not appear to be septic
   - Continue PO amiodarone until confirm or rule out toxicity and
   cardiology input re alternative rate control [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - f/u pancultures
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone although
   missed last few doses, as well as metoprolol due to hypotnesion.  Also
   likely component of hypoxia inducing afib given worsening lung disease.
   Reverted into NSR with bolus and PO, with short reversion to Afib rate
   in 120s with other VSS.
   - Continue home amiodarone
   - Restarted home metoprolol 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] for additional rate control
   - Anticoagulation deferred for h/o GIB requiring 12U of transfusion.
   - cardiology consult re potential alternative therapy if amiodarone
   toxicity confirmed.
   #) Chest discomfort: Patient describes atypical left chest wall pain.
   Less likely ACS given relatively flat cardiac enzymes and EKG without
   significant change. No pneumothorax or PE seen on imaging. Could be
   secondary to small pleural effusion, metastatic disease, or PNA. No rib
   fracture seen on CXR.
   - Hydromorphone at home dose
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - discuss long term plan with oncology
   - palliative care and social work consults
   #) Anemia: Baseline in mid-20s. Has dropped since admission from 28.3
   to 22.6 and 23 on repeat.  Denies any chest pain, lightheadedness and
   VSS.  Sputum not bloody, no signs of active bleeding per stool/urine.
   Likely component of dilution (+1.5L)
   - Type and cross active
   - Consider slow transfusion (EF 50%, likely worse with tachycardia),
   although not convinced that pt requires volume.
   - Guaiac stools
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Will be on increased steroids for ? amio
   toxicity.
   #) Coronary artery disease: CE
s neg, EKG unchanged.
   - Continue home aspirin, restarted BB
   - holding home [**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan, not on statin due to allergy.
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points:
   Mrs [**Known lastname 8556**] has had progressive decline in her breathing with
   worsening O2 needs and now development of Afib/ RVR in setting of
   hypoxemia. She denies cough or hemoptyis or chest pain either.
   Exam notable for elderly WF with Tm of 99 BP of 110/70 HR of 60 to 110
   ( NSR or afib) RRof 24  with sats of 97% on NRB FM . She has end
   inspiratory crackels in all lung fields and no evidence for wheeze. She
   does not have peripheral edema.
   Labs notable for WBC4.4  K, HCT 23.0 , K+ 4.0 , Cr  0.9, lactate. 1.5 (
   2.7) , LDH is 335, cortisol is 42. CXR with diffuse ASD ( reticular and
   alveolar infiltrates in Lingula, RUL, RML, RLL), CT shows diffuse
   infiltrates in all lung fields with traction bronchiectasis, minimal
   effusions, enlarging lung nodules (? mets) and some GGO in subsegments
   too. PA size has increased and c/w CXR of [**9-29**], changes have rapidly
   worsened. EKG is without ischemic change.
   I am concerned regarding possible interstial PNA ( ? PCP vs atypical
   infection vs amiodarone pulmonary toxicity) in addition to advancing
   tumor burden ( increasing nodules and ? lymphangitis)..We will attempt
   sputum induction today but may need intubation for Bronchoscopy / BAL
   to r/o infectious etiology. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) **]  ( follows patient closely) will
   be consulted regarding this but repeat echo to assess pulmonary
   pressures will be done in next 24 hrs. For the short term higher dose
   steroids will be started today and coverage continued for CAP (
   atypical). if she cannot sustain NSR, we will request cardiology
   colleagues to advise regarding alternative agents for rhythm control.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation. She presents with acute on chronic respiratory failure and worsening multifocal pneumonia. The patient's current condition is critical, and she is experiencing hypoxia, requiring nonrebreather oxygen therapy. Her vital signs show tachycardia and hypotension. She has decreased breath sounds over the left base with rales present, as well as scattered wheezes upon expiration. Imaging findings indicate worsening disease with enlarging nodular opacities and traction bronchiectasis. 

The patient's anemia is likely due to dilution from fluid administration. There are no signs of active bleeding or chest pain. Her renal function is stable, and she is already on prophylactic anticoagulation for DVT. She has a history of coronary artery disease, gout, and polymyalgia rheumatica. 

The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and she has discussed her wishes with her family. She does not want measures to prolong her life. The plan is to continue ICU level care until her respiratory status and blood pressure stabilize."

   Assessment and Plan
   Ms. [**Known lastname 8556**] is a 69 year old female with past medical history of
   squamous cell carcinoma and atrial fibrillation who presents with
   dyspnea, with CT chest concerning for worsening disease and multifocal
   pneumonia.
   .
   #) Dyspnea: Likely multifactorial, however suspect large component was
   secondary to atrial fibrillation with RVR leading to poor forward flow
   without atrial kick (discussed below). CT also demonstrated multi-focal
   pneumonia, though she has had little clinical symptoms to suggest this;
   a post-obstructive pneumonia is certainly possible as well, which could
   remain more clinically asymptomatic. Her worsening underlying lung
   malignancy also could account for some degree of her dyspnea, but would
   not expect this to be so acute unless she had collapse or plugging. A
   primary cardiac event is also possible. PE in setting of malignancy is
   a possibility, but ruled out by CTA. CXR negative for pneumothorax.
   Heart failure is also a possibility, however she does not have any
   significant edema.
   - Trend lactate, VBG
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes
   - Repeat EKG now
   - Patient already received levofloxacin for pneumonia in [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 178**]
   discuss further broadening coverage.
   - Follow up blood, sputum cultures
   - Nebulizer treatments if helpful (though will avoid albuterol until
   stable heart rate for a few more hours)
   - Checking BNP given history of orthopnea, however suspect this was
   more likely due to AF with RVR
   - Consider repeat transthoracic echocardiogram should her hypoxia and
   dyspnea not improve with above measures
   .
   #) Hypotension: Differential includes secondary to poor forward flow
   from rapid ventricular response to AF, sepsis from infection, adrenal
   insufficiency, medication effect from amiodarone load and PO dose, and
   poor PO intake leading to hypovolemia. Other less likely possibilities
   include cardiac event, pneumothorax in setting of blebs seen on CT
   (though no pneumothorax seen on CXR or CT).
   - IVF resuscitation until lactate normalizes, following urine output
   - Checking random cortisol, initiating stress dose steroids given
   chronic steroid use and recent taper from higher doses
   - Expand antibiotic coverage
   - Continue PO amiodarone to improve HR control
   - Cycle cardiac enzymes, though suspect she may have bump in troponin
   given demand of RVR
   - Sending urine, blood cultures, sputum if able (although already
   received antibiotics in ED prior to any cultures being obtained)
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: Patient presented to ED in AF with RVR. She has
   a history of this, and is usually maintained on PO amiodarone. She
   reported not taking her amiodarone or metoprolol in the setting of not
   feeling well for the last two days. Currently her rate is appropriately
   controlled after receiving amiodarone bolus and PO home dose.
   - Continue home amiodarone, holding metoprolol given hypotension
   - Patient is not currently anticoagulated. She reports she had a 12
   unit GIB in the past due to diverticulosis, so anti-coagulation has
   been held since that time.
   .
   #) Squamous cell lung carcinoma: Patient is followed by Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 1051**]
   and [**Name5 (PTitle) 1055**] here at [**Hospital1 54**]. She was last seen as an outpatient on
   [**2143-1-29**], at which time it appeared her brain metastases had responded
   well to XRT, however her CT in the ED appeared to be consistent with
   worsening pulmonary disease. It is unclear if there will be further
   chemotherapy regimens available to her based on the last oncology note
   given her poor response and poorly toleration of the first line
   chemotherapy.
   - Will alert oncology of patient's admission, appreciate any
   recommendations or assistance with management.
   .
   #) Anemia: Patient's anemia appears to be at her baseline (last HCT of
   35.2 appears to be abherration from others in system which are 24-27).
   Should she have symptoms of ischemia, would consider transfusion to
   assist with volume repletion.
   - Send type and cross, consider transfusion should she continue to need
   volume and/or become symptomatic.
   .
   #) Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient's baseline creatinine over last
   months appears to be 1.1-1.2. Currently her creatinine is better than
   baseline at 0.8, which would actually agrue against volume depletion.
   - Monitor trend, appropriately renally dose medications
   .
   #) Polymyalgia rheumatica: Continue steroid therapy (just completed
   taper down to home dose of 10 mg prednisone daily), however suspect she
   would benefit from stress dosing for her acute illness, given that she
   had been on higher doses with her history of being on steroids for her
   cerebral edema on a longer term basis.
   - Stress dose steroids
   .
   #) Coronary artery disease: EKG
   - Will cycle enzymes
   - Continue home aspirin, holding home BP medications ([**Last Name (un) 239**] candesartan)
   given hypotension, has allergy to statins.
   - Repeat EKG
   .
   #) Gout: Continue allopurinol at home dose.
   .
   #) FEN: Once respiratory status more stable, cardiac diet. No need for
   further IVF, given she appears euvolemic. Electrolytes WNL.
   .
   #) PPx: Heparin SQ TID, PPI, bowel regimen as needed
   .
   #) Contact: [**Name (NI) 3582**], daughter # [**Telephone/Fax (1) 8557**] (She states her husband does
   not answer the phone regularly)
   .
   #) Code: Full, however patient reports she has discussed her wishes at
   length with her family. She would want initial efforts at
   resuscitation, however would not want support.

Coronary artery disease is present, but troponins are negative. The patient will continue home aspirin and hold BP medications (candesartan) due to hypotension. She has an allergy to statins.

Gout is also present, and the patient will continue allopurinol at home dose.

Thrombocytopenia is concerning for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Heparin has been discontinued, and other prophylactic measures are in place.

Once the patient's respiratory status is more stable, a cardiac diet will be initiated. No further IV fluids are needed as the patient appears euvolemic. Electrolytes are within normal limits.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and experiencing respiratory distress. The patient has a history of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 134/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis. Physical examination reveals no acute distress, overweight/obese build, and clear breath sounds. The patient's labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and decreased platelet count. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory distress and has progressive radiographic infiltrates, which may indicate pneumonia or another underlying respiratory condition. This could lead to further deterioration in respiratory function and potentially require intubation and mechanical ventilation.

2. Cardiac arrhythmias: The patient is currently in atrial fibrillation but is rate-controlled. However, there is a concern for bradycardia due to the use of metoprolol. Monitoring the heart rate and adjusting medication as needed will be important to prevent or manage cardiac arrhythmias.

3. Hypotension: The patient previously experienced hypotension, which was resolved with intravenous fluids. Possible causes include adrenal insufficiency, and it is important to monitor blood pressure and maintain mean arterial"
