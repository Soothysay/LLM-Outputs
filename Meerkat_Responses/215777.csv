   HYPERKALEMIA -- resolved following interventions.  Maintain within

   DIGOXIN TOXICITY -- responding to therapy.  Hold further digoxin
   binding [**Doctor Last Name **].  Follow digoxin level.
   RENAL FAILURE -- acute (?baseline normal vs. CRI).  Contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4157**]
   (near [**Location (un) 4158**], NY) to obtain additional medical information.  Plan

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 79-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperkalemia, acute renal failure, and digoxin toxicity. The patient has been experiencing foot pain chronically. No new clinical events were reported overnight, and the patient's bradycardia improved. The patient received digoxin binding and continues to experience symptoms of foot pain. The patient's allergies, medical history, social history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted events above.

Vital signs include a temperature of 35.4 C (95.7 F), heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia. Fluid balance shows an intake of 812 mL and output of 640 mL, with a balance of 172 mL. Respiratory support includes oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 100%, and the patient is not on mechanical ventilation. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears comfortable, well-nourished, and somewhat cachectic. The patient has PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and warm skin without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows that the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, oriented to person, place"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 79-year-old male with acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and digoxin toxicity. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 51 bpm, blood pressure of 93/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has been receiving treatment for hyperkalemia and digoxin toxicity, which appears to be responding well. The cause of the renal failure is still being determined, and further evaluation is needed.

The patient's labs show elevated potassium levels (22 mEq/L) and low blood glucose (64 mg/dL). The creatinine level is slightly elevated at 3.1 mg/dL. Troponin-T levels are within normal range (0.08). Calcium and magnesium levels are normal.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, cachexia, or jaundice. The cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure. The respiratory examination is clear bilaterally. The abdomen is soft and non-tender with bowel sounds present. No extremity edema or clubbing is noted. Neurologic examination is normal.

The patient's main medical issues include acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and digoxin toxicity. These conditions require close monitoring and appropriate interventions. The patient's overall condition is critical, and he will continue to be managed in the ICU."

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male admitted to the ICU with dyspnea and respiratory distress. They have undergone various tests including a trans-thoracic echo, ultrasound, and several laboratory tests. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 35.7°C, heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. They are on mechanical ventilation support. The patient appears comfortable without any signs of pain or distress. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the cardiovascular or respiratory systems, and the neurological examination is normal.

Medical Complications:
1. Digoxin toxicity: The patient's lab results show elevated levels of digoxin, which can lead to digoxin toxicity. Symptoms of digoxin toxicity include nausea, vomiting, confusion, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest.
2. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is high at 5.6 mEq/L, indicating hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and even cardiac arrest.
3. Right hydronephrosis: The patient's imaging results show right hydronephrosis, which is the swelling of the kidney due to a build-up of urine. This can be caused by an obstruction in the urinary tract.
4. Renal failure: The patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN)"

   RIGHT HYDRONEPHROSIS
 unclear as to duration (suspect subacute or

   contributing.  Unclear etiology for hydronephrosis
 need to obtain

   (ex. Further imaging).
   RENAL FAILURE
 acute, non-oliguric; slowly improving.  Unclear

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-inch tall male with a current temperature of 35.7°C (96.2°F), heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure of 113/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on sinus bradycardia and has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, digoxin toxicity, and hyperkalemia. The patient's vital signs and laboratory results are within normal limits, except for elevated levels of potassium (K+), creatinine (Cr), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). The patient has been receiving IV fluids and medications for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's current condition is described as comfortable, with no acute distress or pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, which is characterized by a sudden decrease in kidney function. This can lead to the accumulation of waste products and electrolyte imbalances in the body. Complications may include fluid overload, electrolyte disturbances, and the need for dialysis.

2. Digoxin Toxicity: The patient has evidence of digoxin toxicity, likely due to acute renal failure. Digoxin toxicity can cause various symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, confusion, weakness, and cardiac"
