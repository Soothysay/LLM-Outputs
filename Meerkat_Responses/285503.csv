   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.

   [**2134-5-22**].
   I would add the following remarks:
   Medical Decision Making
   She has not had significant bradycardia here and etiology of transient
   bradycardia may be some degree of contribution from her infection.  I
   suspect that she will not need a pacemaker but will obtain EP input.
   Hold dopamine.   Consult renal service regarding management of anuric
   renal failure.  Her Aortic stenosis does not seem to be a major
   hemodynamic contributor.  Treat for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
   Date of service [**2134-5-22**]  Time spent with patient 40 minutes.
   ------ Protected Section Addendum Entered By:[**Name (NI) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], MD

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a medical history of coronary artery disease post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, chronic renal failure, and aortic stenosis. She was admitted to the ICU with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure.

The patient's abdominal girth has increased due to the accumulation of ascites. This can cause a restrictive process where the pressure of the fluid against the lungs and chest wall increases the work of breathing, as well as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). SBP is suspected because of the high white blood cell count (>2900 with 92% polymorphonuclear cells) and low ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) of 1.7. Treatment for SBP includes ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg.

The patient also has portal hypertension as evidenced by a high serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of 2.3, which is consistent with cirrhosis. The most common causes of cirrhosis in the USA are alcohol and Hepatitis C, but these are less likely in this patient due to a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug abuse. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is another possibility"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure (ARF) on chronic renal failure.

Assessment:
1. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): The patient's ascites fluid analysis showed WBC >2900 with 92% polymorphonuclear cells (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) 1.7, suggesting SBP. She was started on ceftriaxone for 5 days and will receive albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3. Prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin will be considered after discontinuing ceftriaxone.
2. Cirrhosis: The patient's high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1 = 2.3) indicates portal hypertension as the etiology of her ascites. Cirrhosis is the most likely cause of portal hypertension in this case.
3. Aortic"

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute on
   chronic renal failure due to ATN from hypotension during her episodes
   of supra-therapeutic drug action. We
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, and hypertension. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency.

The patient has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) based on the analysis of peritoneal fluid showing WBC count of >2900 with 92% polymorphonuclear cells (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) 1.7. She has been started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 5 days and will receive albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3. She will also require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life to decrease the incidence of recurrent SBP.

Her liver cirrhosis is likely secondary to an unknown etiology. She has portal hypertension and ascites. Her MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at 3 months.

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal

   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary

   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD post triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI. She was transferred from OSH with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. 

The patient's increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing peritoneal ascites. She also has shortness of breath, which was likely caused by the accumulation of ascites in two ways: a restrictive process where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall increases the work of breathing; and b) via spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which increases her white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in discomfort of breathing.

To evaluate the patient's ascites, an ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900 with 92% polys and ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5) suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, which suggests peritonitis.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the ICU with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. These include:

1. Ascites: The patient's increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing peritoneal ascites. The ascitic fluid analysis showed white blood cell count of >2900 with 92% polymorphonuclear cells, indicating peritonitis. She was started on ceftriaxone and albumin therapy for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She will also require regular ciprofloxacin to prevent recurrence of SBP.

2. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.7 and peak gradient of 100 mmHg. This contributes to her dyspnea. Further evaluation with a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is needed to assess valve function. If severe, intervention such as valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement (AVR) may be considered.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has had episodes of bradycardia"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, most consistent with spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily
   x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin
   1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro
   for the rest of her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Top of the differential diagnosis for portal
   hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis. Because
   our patient has SBP,
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.
   [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] at [**Hospital1 19**]. Previously attributed to steatohepatitis. Complicated by
   portal hypertension, ascites. MELD 24, CHILDS B.

   - Ultrasound-guided paracentesis (diagnostic)
   - Liver recs (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**]
   - Low salt diet, fluid restriction

   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear source of infection. Differential diagnosis
   includes aspiration pneumonia, SBP, UTI. Was given levofloxacin IV at
   OSH given suspicion for aspiration pneumonia.
   - CXR
   - UA
   - Urine culture, blood cultures

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. She presented with severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient had increased abdominal girth and shortness of breath, which were found to be due to ascites caused by spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She underwent an ultrasound-guided paracentesis, removing 1.4 liters of peritoneal fluid, which was consistent with SBP. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and albumin for treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aortic Stenosis: The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.7. This can lead to dyspnea and may require intervention such as valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement (AVR) if severe.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has experienced episodes of bradycardia. It is important to monitor her heart rhythm and consider pacemaker placement if necessary.
3. Hypotension: The patient has been hypotensive, possibly due to cardiogenic shock or sepsis. Dopamine infusion has been initiated, and beta-blockers should be held.

   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves

   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's abdominal distension was found to be due to ascites, which was confirmed by ultrasound-guided paracentesis. The ascitic fluid analysis showed white blood cell (WBC) count of >2900 with 92% polymorphonuclear cells, consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone and albumin therapy as per the treatment protocol for SBP.

The patient's serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) is 2.3, indicating that the ascites is due to portal hypertension, likely secondary to cirrhosis. The total protein concentration of the ascitic fluid is 1.7 g/dL, which is lower than the serum protein concentration of 6.5 g/dL. This suggests a transudative mechanism for the ascites rather than an exudative one.

The patient's cardiac history includes severe AS with a valve area of 0.9"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, causes anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   Furthermore, her CHILDS-[**Last Name (un) 7720**] classification (which is used in
   patients with cirrhosis to assess peri-operative risk for mortality) is
 given her ascites and serum albumin of 3.4, which puts her at 31%
   risk for dying if she were to have surgery (see Garrison et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals
   of Surgery [**2108**]). Therefore, at this time the cons of surgery are
   unlikely to out-weight the pros of a new aortic valve.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. We did not get an EKG so we cannot assess fully the rhythm,
   but the outside hospital EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack
   of P waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given
   that the patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          Will consider abx if has positive infectious work-up
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed. 

1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites with a high white blood cell count in the ascitic fluid, indicating SBP. She is being treated with ceftriaxone and albumin, which are recommended for SBP management.

2. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.9 cm^2. This condition may require valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement in the future, but surgery is not indicated at this time due to the patient's current infection with SBP.

3. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate becomes bradycardic, likely due to carvedilol toxicity. Carvedilol has been discontinued, and she will be monitored closely. Atropine is available at the bedside, and an EP consult has been requested for evaluation of pacemaker placement.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (ACRF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level, indicating renal dysfunction. This may be due to acute tubular necrosis (ATN) caused by hypotension or other factors. Nephrology consult has been requested, and further evaluation of urine output and renal function is planned.

5. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has dropped from 32 to 25, suggesting"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) status post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal failure. She was admitted to the outside hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis (AS), bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute renal failure (ARF).

The patient's increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing peritoneal ascites.

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s, and ascitic fluid total protein 1.7 vs serum
   total protein 6.5.
   Measurement of the ascetic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   differentiating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis, where lowest
   protein concentration correlates with a highest risk of developing SBP
   because of low concentrations of opsonins.
   most consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
   (
   Low-protein-concentration ascitic fluid is predisposed to spontaneous
   bacterial peritonitis.

   The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day
   1=[**2134-5-21**]) and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3
   ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will need to regular cipro for the rest of
   her life to prevent recurrence.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([1]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[2]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post triple coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was transferred from an outside hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

The patient's symptoms include increasing abdominal girth, shortness of breath, and right shoulder pain. Physical examination reveals an obese abdomen with visible hernia below the right breast, periumbilical tenderness, dullness to percussion, and no fluid wave appreciated. No lower extremity edema or asterixis is present, and neurological examination is intact.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, elevated creatinine, and elevated blood urea nitrogen. The patient has a high serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) of 2.3, indicating portal hypertension as the etiology of her ascites. The ascitic fluid analysis shows a total protein concentration of 1.7 g/dL, consistent with transudate.

The patient has been diagnosed with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg. She will also receive albumin 1"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES.
   The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably related to the
   ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where it is harder
   for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs and chest wall;
   and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count, causing anion-gap
   metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production, causing tachypnea
   to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2119**]).
   The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   mysterious. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is also common.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post triple CABG, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was transferred from outside hospital with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient has increased abdominal girth due to ascites, which is likely secondary to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). She underwent an ultrasound-guided paracentesis, which showed a high number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (>250) with low ascitic fluid total protein concentration (<2.5), suggesting SBP. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and albumin to treat SBP and improve renal function. Her SAAG is 2.3, indicating portal hypertension as the etiology of her ascites. The patient's aortic stenosis contributes to her dyspnea, and further evaluation with TTE is planned. Bradycardia and hypotension are also present, and the patient is on dopamine for hemodynamic support. She has a history of liver cirrhosis with unknown etiology, complicated by portal hypertension and ascites. The patient's MELD score is 24, and she has a CHILD B cirrhosis. Diagnostic paracentesis, abdominal ultrasound with Doppler, and liver consult are pending"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics is
   warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was started on
   ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]). Furthermore, patients
   with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired renal function, which
   often results in increased morbidity and mortality. By administering IV
   albumin (which expands plasma volume and increases blood flow to the
   kidneys), one reduces morality rates at three months from 41% to 22%
   (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore, our patient was also given
   albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday, and will receive an additional 1.0g/kg on
   day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term prophylaxis, the patient will
   require a weekly dose of 750 mg ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life
   because it decreases incidence of SBP from 22% to 3.6%, without
   development of acquired resistance to ciprofloxacin (see Rolachon et
   [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2119**]).
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely etiology because the vast
   majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension secondary to
   cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely cause given her low AFTP
   (CHF is associated with high AFTP), and
   , especially since she does not have have a history of alcohol abuse.
   it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause in our patient.
   In terms of diagnosis of ascites, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   ascetic fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.

The patient was treated with ceftriaxone IV and albumin 1.5g/kg to improve renal function and reduce mortality rates.

2. Portal hypertension: The etiology of the patient's ascites is portal hypertension, as indicated by the high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1 = 2.3). This suggests a transudative process rather than an exudative one.

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # ASCITES. The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to
   increasing peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably
   related to the ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process where
   it is harder for her to inhale due to the pressure against her lungs
   and chest wall; and (b) via SBP, which increases her white count,
   causing anion-gap metabolic acidosis due to increased CO2 production,
   causing tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, causing discomfort of
   breathing.
   Yesterday
s ultrasound-guided paracentesis showed ~5L of ascites.
   Approximately 1.4L of peritoneal fluid was removed and showed WBC of
   >2900 with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total
   protein (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP
   (<2.5) suggests SBP. It is the measurement of the ascetic fluid total
   protein concentration that assists in differentiating SBP from
   secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein concentration
   correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is thought that
   the low protein concentration correlates with low concentrations of
   opsonins, which decreases the efficacy of innate immunity in the
   peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see [**Last Name (un) 7710**],
   Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know that most
   cases of SBP are due to [**Male First Name (un) **] bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella) and that
   sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus can be the
   culprit. Therefore, treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum antibiotics
   is warranted unless further susceptibility can be found. Therefore, our
   patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   She was also started on albumin 1.5g/kg, because
. (look this up)
   She will need albumin 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). Afterwards, she will
   need to continue regular cipro for the rest of her life to prevent
   recurrence.
   In terms of long-term prophylaxis, there was astudy (below
   single weekly dose of 750 mg of [1]ciprofloxacin [[2]32]. In this
   trial, 60 patients with cirrhosis and a low ascitic fluid protein
   concentration (
1.5 g/dL) were randomly assigned to weekly
   ciprofloxacin or placebo for six months. There was a significant
   decrease in the incidence of SBP with ciprofloxacin (3.6 versus 22
   percent) without the development of acquired resistance to
   ciprofloxacin.
   Ciprofloxacin and long-term prevention of spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis: results of a prospective controlled trial.

   Hepatology [**2119**] [**Month (only) **];22(4 Pt 1):1171-4.
   The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by her
   high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin = 3.4-1.1
   = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **]. in Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). In general, top of the differential diagnosis for
   portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and alcoholic hepatitis.
   Because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis, it is most likely that cirrhosis is the cause
   in our patient.
    AFTP of most spontaneously infected ascites is usually low,
   The vast majority of patients with SBP have portal hypertension
   secondary to cirrhosis. Patients with a serum-ascites albumin gradient
   below 1.1 g/dL (ie, without portal hypertension) rarely develop SBP.
   Measurement of the ascitic fluid total protein concentration assists in
   separating SBP from secondary bacterial peritonitis ([3]see
   ""Distinction of spontaneous from secondary bacterial peritonitis""
   below). It correlates inversely with the risk of developing SBP
   [[4]15]. Patients with the most dilute ascites (ie, protein
   concentration less than 1 gm/dL) have the lowest concentration of
   opsonins in the ascitic fluid and are at the highest risk for SBP
   Please note that high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the same as
   transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to ascetic
   fluid total protein concentration, not just the albumin.
   consistent with transudate; total protein ascites 1.7 vs. serum 6.5
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS and recent episodes of
   bradycardia, hypotension. History also significant for leukocytosis,
   acute on chronic renal failure.
   .
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed above. No chest pain
   currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not necessarily
   reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report, cardiac
   biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - TTE to evaluate for diastolic dysfunction, severity of AS
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension. Hold
   hypotension given recent hypotension; unclear if patient needs to be on
   ACE inhibitor as she is not known to have heart failure.
   - Will restart furosemide as renal function improves
   .
   #. Aortic stenosis:  Reported as severe at OSH with valve area 0.7,
   peak gradient 100mgHg. Interestingly, patient has had TTE in past
   (records unavailable at this time) without mention of aortic stenosis.
   Aortic stenosis likely contributes to this patient's dyspnea.
   - TTE to evaluate valve function
   - If severe, consider intervention. Valvuloplasty would be a temporary
   solution. AVR is more permanent, but given cirrhosis, risk of surgery
   may be high.
   .
   # RHYTHM:  Bradycardic to mid-30s at OSH. EKG with junctional rhythm.
   Could this have been in context of decreased clearance of beta-blocker?
   Currently in NSR with rate in 60s. No evidence of AV block. No ischemic
   changes seen in RCA territory to suggest sinus node dysfunction.
   - EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   - Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   - Atropine at bedside
   - Monitor on telemetry
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Noted with onset of bradycardia. Transferred on
   dopamine at 5mcg/kg/min. Patient with hypertension at baseline. Appears
   to be cardiogenic in origin given bradycardia; it is unclear whether
   attempt was made to wean patient off of dopamine once bradycardia
   resolved. Given leukocytosis, sepsis is also on differential.
   - Continue to wean dopamine
   - Hold antihypertensives
   - Will cater antibiotics (if needed) based on infectious work-up below
   .
   # h/o liver cirrhosis:  Underlying etiology unknown. Followed by Dr.

","The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease, post triple CABG, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus type II, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency. She was admitted to the ICU with new findings of severe aortic stenosis, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient has ascites due to portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. She was found to have spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) with high neutrophil count (>250) in the ascitic fluid and low ascitic fluid total protein (AFTP) concentration (<2.5 g/dL). She was started on ceftriaxone for 5 days and albumin 1.5g/kg.
- Long-term prophylaxis for SBP with ciprofloxacin is recommended, as it has been shown to decrease the incidence of SBP without the development of acquired resistance.
- The patient also has severe aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.7 cm2. Aortic stenosis contributes to her dyspnea. TTE is planned to evaluate valve function, and if severe, intervention such as valvuloplasty or AVR may be considered.
- Bradycardia and hypotension are likely due to aortic stenosis and sepsis. Dopamine was started for"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's health progress in the ICU can be summarized as follows:

The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided paracentesis and had 1.4L of peritoneal fluid removed, which was consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The patient was started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily for 5 days and received albumin 1.5g/kg. The SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin) was calculated to be 2.3, indicating a transudative etiology of ascites.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed aortic stenosis with a valve area of 0.9cm2, mild left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with preserved ejection fraction (EF), a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) greater than 18mmHg, 2+ mitral regurgitation (MR), and mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. No pericardial effusion was observed.

The patient's urine output was monitored, and a Foley catheter was removed. A renal ultrasound (RUQ duplex u/s) showed normal Doppler patency and flow of the hepatic veins and portal vein. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level was elevated at 27.5%, with a urine sodium of 20, suggesting prerenal azotemia, although hepat"

   Assessment and Plan
   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.

","Based on the patient's progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP): The patient has ascites and a high white blood cell count in the peritoneal fluid, suggesting SBP. Treatment with ceftriaxone and albumin is warranted.

2. Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has severe AS with a valve area of 0.9 cm2. This can cause symptoms such as dyspnea on exertion, angina, and syncope. The patient's recent dyspnea may be due to SBP and resultant tachypnea, but further evaluation for valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement may be necessary after the infection is cleared.

3. Bradycardia: The patient becomes bradycardic during the night, possibly due to carvedilol toxicity. Carvedilol has been discontinued, and the patient should recover soon. Atropine at bedside and telemetry monitoring have been recommended.

4. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure (ACRF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level of 3.5, which could be due to ATN secondary to hypotension or prerenal causes. HCTZ use may also contribute to renal dysfunction. A urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na study is pending.

5. Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS): While the patient's renal function"

   77F with CAD s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, CRI transferred
   from OSH with new finding of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension,
   leukocytosis, and ARF on CRI, in the setting of increasing shortness of
   breath and abdominal girth.
   # SBP / ASCITES / CIRRHOSIS.
        The patient
s increasing abdominal girth is due to increasing
   peritoneal ascites. Her shortness of breath was probably caused by the
   accumulation of ascites in two ways: (a) via a restrictive process
   where the pressure of the fluid against her lungs and chest wall
   increases the work of breathing; and (b) via the spontaneous bacterial
   peritonitis (SBP) that is present in the ascites, which increases her
   white count, and her non-gap acidosis which causes increased CO2
   production, causes tachypnea to blow off excess CO2, resulting in
   discomfort of breathing.
        In order to evaluate the patient
s ascites, an ultrasound-guided
   paracentesis was performed yesterday. The scan showed ~5L of peritoneal
   fluid, of which approximately 1.4L was removed and showed WBC of >2900
   with 92% poly
s (absolute ~2600 polys) and ascitic fluid total protein
   (AFTP) 1.7. The high number of polys (>250) with low AFTP (<2.5)
   suggests SBP. Measurement of the AFTP assists in differentiating SBP
   from secondary bacterial peritonitis, because lowest protein
   concentration correlates with the highest risk of developing SBP. It is
   thought that the low protein concentration correlates with low
   concentrations of opsonins, which decreases the response of innate
   immunity in the peritoneum and thus predisposes to infection (see
   [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Gastrooenterology [**2110**]; and [**Last Name (un) 7710**], Hepatology [**2112**]). We know
   that most cases of SBP are due to gut bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella)
   and that sometimes even streptococcus and infrequently staphylococcus
   can be the culprit, so treatment with somewhat broad-spectrum
   antibiotics is warranted at least initially. Therefore, our patient was
   started on ceftriaxone 1g IV daily x5 days (day 1=[**2134-5-21**]).
   Furthermore, patients with cirrhosis and SBP frequently have impaired
   renal function, which often results in increased morbidity and
   mortality. By administering IV albumin (which expands plasma volume and
   increases blood flow to the kidneys), one reduces morality rates at
   three months from 41% to 22% (see Sort et [**Doctor Last Name **], NEJM [**2123**]). Therefore,
   our patient was also given albumin 1.5g/kg yesterday and will receive
   an additional 1.0g/kg on day 3 ([**2134-5-23**]). In terms of long-term
   prophylaxis, the patient will require a weekly dose of 750 mg
   ciprofloxacin for the rest of her life, which will decrease the
   incidence of recurrent SBP from 22% to 3.6% (see Rolachon et [**Doctor Last Name **],
   Hepatology [**2119**]).
        The etiology of her ascites is portal hypertension as evidenced by
   her high gradient SAAG (serum albumin - peritoneal fluid albumin =
   3.4-1.1 = 2.3, where high gradient is >1.1, which has 97% accuracy for
   predicting portal hypertension [see [**Last Name (un) 7710**] et [**Doctor Last Name **], Annals of Internal
   Medicine [**2116**]]). Importantly, high vs. low gradient SAAG is not the
   same as transudative/exudative ascites, which refers specifically to
   AFTP concentration (not albumin). In general, top of the differential
   diagnosis for portal hypertension includes cirrhosis, CHF, and
   alcoholic hepatitis. In our patient, cirrhosis is the most likely
   etiology because the vast majority of patients with SBP have portal
   hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. Furthermore, CHF is an unlikely
   cause (even in the setting of her aortic stenosis) because her EF is
   normal at ~60% and she has low AFTP (CHF is associated with high AFTP).
   Lastly, alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely because she denies a history of
   extensive alcohol abuse.
        The etiology of her cirrhosis, on the other hand, is much more
   elusive. The two most common causes in the USA are alcohol and
   Hepatitis C. Again, a lack of history of alcohol abuse and elicit drug
   abuse make these less likely etiologies. Another possibility is
   nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, but only a biopsy can offer a more
   definitive diagnosis. Given her Cr = 3.5, Tbili = 0.7, INR = 1.7, her
   calculated MELD score is 23, which is associated with ~90% survival at
   3 months (see Kamath et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology [**2125**]).
   -          Continue on ceftriaxone 1 g qd for 5 days (day 1 = [**2134-5-21**])
   -          Albumin 1.0g/kg on [**2134-5-23**]
   -          Will consider Cipro 750 mg qweek after ceftriaxone is
   discontinued
   -          Appreciate recommendation from Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2578**] (hepatology)
   -          Low salt diet, fluid restriction
   # AORTIC STENOSIS.  The patient has what we believe to be new-onset
   aortic stenosis, with our TTE showing aortic valve area of 0.9cm^2,
   peak gradient ~80 and mean gradient ~50. Given her current infection
   with SBP and lack of severe symptoms related to AS, aggressive
   intervention should be delayed until her infection is cleared.
   Afterwards, she may be evaluated for valvuloplasty (a temporary
   solution) or aortic valve replacement (a more permanent solution). The
   usual indications for AVR surgery include dyspnea on exertion (5 year
   survival from time of diagnosis), angina with exertion (3 year
   survival), or syncope with exertion (1 year survival), or severe LV
   dysfunction from AVR. Given that the running hypothesis is that her
   dyspnea over the past couple of days is due to SBP and the resultant
   tachypnea, she does not have any of these indications for surgery.
   # BRADYCARDIA.  The patient becomes bradycardic during the night to the
   low 40s. This was consistent with what happened at the outside
   hospital, where EKGs suggest junctional rhythm given the lack of P
   waves. This is most likely due to carvedilol
toxicity.
 Given that the
   patient has cirrhosis, she has decreased hepatic metabolism of
   carvedilol, which effectively enhances the doses she receives. Since
   carvedilol is a beta-blocker, she is probably experiencing
   supra-therapeutic effects of the drug that are causing her to become
   bradycardic. We have discontinued her carvedilol and hypothesize that
   her bradycardia should resolve soon. In the future she will need to be
   on a smaller dose, if at all. Given that she also has chronic renal
   failure, switching to a drug that is renally metabolized will probably
   not be a feasible alternative.
   -          hold carvedilol given cirrhosis/ascites
   -          EP consulted for evaluation for pacemaker placement
   -          Hold beta-blocker, calcium-channel blocker
   -          Atropine at bedside
   -          Monitor on telemetry
   # ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE.  The patient most likely has acute
   (Cr 3.5) on chronic renal failure (baseline Cr 1.7) due to ATN that
   occurred during her episodes of supra-therapeutic drug action causing
   hypotension. Differential also includes ATN secondary to prerenal
   etiology given poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. [**Month (only) 51**]
   also be secondary to medications - recently started on HCTZ. We will
   send for urine-lytes/osmolarity/Na to further assess.
        The most feared etiology would be hepatorenal syndrome
   (development of acute renal failure in a patient who has advanced liver
   disease due to cirrhosis) because prognosis for these patients is poor,
   with a median survival of 3.3 months (see Alessandria et [**Doctor Last Name **], Hepatology
   [**2129**]). ARF in these patients occurs due to splanchnic vasodilatation
   and increases in nitric oxide circulation, which eventually reduces GFR
   and damages the kidneys. Diagnostic criteria for hepatorenal syndrome
   include a rise in creatinine above 1.5, absence of other causes for
   renal disease (including shock, bacterial infection, SBP, nephrotoxic
   durg use, post-renal obstruction), urine red cell excretion of less
   than 50 cells per HPF, and lack of improvement in renal function after
   volume expansion with IV albumin for at least two days. Given that she
   has a good story for other causes of ARF (i.e. SBP and some component
   of hypotension), the fact that her renal function did not improve with
   IV albumin is not as suggestive of hepatorenal syndrome, because she
   likely has ATN which will take at least a few days to recover.
   Therefore, we will trend her creatinine and we do not expect to see a
   fall until at least 3-5 days (approximately [**Date range (1) 7721**]).
   -          Continue trending creatinine daily
   -          IV albumin tomorrow
   -          Nephrology consult
   -          Urine lytes, UA
   -          Close monitoring of urine output
   -          Hold diuretics
   # ANEMIA.  The patient had a drop in hematocrit from 32 to 25 today.
   This is worrying because it could suggest a GI bleed. She was put on a
   PPI and a type and screen was sent. We will guaiac her stools to check
   for GI bleed.
   -          guaiac stool
   # HYPOTENSION.  The patient
s hypotension has now resolved. She is no
   longer on dopamine. She may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated.
   Although septic shock was initially suspected given her leukocytosis,
   her WBC has now dropped to 19 and she has no fever. Furthermore, her
   liver disease may play a role in dropping her blood pressure in the
   context of decreased production of albumin.
   -          Hold anti-hypertensives
   -          On ceftriaxone now
   #. CORONARIES:  CAD s/p CABG. Anatomy as listed previously. No chest
   pain currently or prior to OSH admission, although this is not
   necessarily reassuring in this female, diabetic patient. By report,
   cardiac biomarkers were negative at outside hospital.
   - Continue aspirin 325mg PO daily
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension
   - Continue simvastatin 20mg PO daily
   .
   #. PUMP:  Per signout, patient was thought to be fluid overloaded at
   OSH, BNP 741 with anasarca, net fluid balance +300ml yesterday, +500ml
   today prior to transfer. TTE there showed preserved EF 65-70% but new
   finding of severe AS with valve area of 0.7. Patient with hypotension
   requiring initation of dopamine gtt.
   - Hold beta-blocker given recent bradycardia, hypotension.
   - Hold lasix
   #. Diabetes melliitus, type II:
   - Continue Humalog sliding scale per home regimen

","Summary:
The patient is a 77-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p triple CABG, cirrhosis, DMII, HTN, and CRI. She was transferred from OSH with new findings of severe AS, bradycardia, hypotension, leukocytosis, and ARF. The patient has increasing abdominal girth due to ascites and shortness of breath caused by the accumulation of ascites. An ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed, revealing >2900 WBCs with 92% polys in the ascitic fluid, suggesting SBP. The patient was started on ceftriaxone and albumin therapy. Her TTE showed aortic valve area of 0.9 cm^2 with peak and mean gradients of ~80 and ~50, respectively. The patient's bradycardia is likely due to carvedilol toxicity, which has been discontinued. She also has acute-on-chronic renal failure due to ATN caused by supra-therapeutic drug action and poor cardiac output secondary to aortic stenosis. The patient's anemia could suggest a GI bleed, so she has been put on a PPI and guaiac testing is ongoing. Her hypotension has resolved, and she may have been dehydrated and/or overmedicated."
