   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of stroke, pneumonia, and hypotension. She presents with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension. The patient initially met the criteria for sepsis and is still requiring vasopressor support at a low dose. The suspected source of sepsis is pneumonia, as evidenced by bilateral opacities on the CT scan.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The source of sepsis is suspected to be pneumonia. Monitoring of vital signs, laboratory results, and response to treatment is essential.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to experience hypotension, which requires ongoing vasopressor support. Close monitoring of blood pressure and adjustment of vasopressor dosage are necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.

3. Volume Overload/CHF: The patient shows signs of volume overload, possibly contributing to congestive heart failure (CHF). It is important to carefully manage fluid administration and consider diuretic therapy once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes off vasopressors.

4. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of bilateral opacities on the CT scan, indicating pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and follow-up cultures will help guide further management.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 78-year-old female with a history of stroke, pneumonia, hypotension, and chronic kidney disease. The patient presents with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: The patient meets SIRS criteria with a temperature of 101°F, elevated white blood cell count, hypoxia, and hypotension. The likely source of sepsis is aspiration pneumonia, although urinary tract infection is less likely. The patient is already receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, IV fluids, and vasopressors to maintain blood pressure and urine output.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to pneumonia or Clostridium difficile infection. Empiric treatment with Flagyl is being given to cover for C. difficile infection.

3. CHF/vol overload: The patient is suspected to have congestive heart failure or volume overload due to unknown left ventricular ejection fraction. Diuretics will be needed once the patient's blood pressure stabilizes off pressors. An echocardiogram will be done to further assess the heart function.

4. History of stroke with aphasia: The patient has a history of stroke with right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. Bilateral lower lobe pneumonia is suspected for aspiration. Speech and swallow evaluation, as well as"

   # Sepsis - Patient  initially on admission met SIRS criteria with T101,
   WBC 26, hypoxia, and hypotension. Was weaned off pressor support
   yesterday am. Suspected current source is aspiration pna given her CT
   evidence of bilateral opacities.  On vanc and zosyn (day 1 = [**2-1**]),
   flagyl was initially started for empiric C diff coverage however given
   the lack of diarrhea of findings of colitis on CT abdomen it was
   stopped..
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics: Will continue Vanc and Zosyn for nursing
   home acquired pna for a 10 day course.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures.  Send a sputum culture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   - Speech and swallow eval given concern for aspiration as the source of
   sepsis.
   # CHF/vol overload: EF unknown.  CT chest showed pulmonary edema with
   effusion.  Was almost 1 L negative yesterday.
   - As her SBPs have been stable, can consider gentle diuresis starting
   with 20 mg IV lasix for a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative today if she
   does not continue to autodiurese on her own.
   - F/u TTE
   - Restart her acei as her BPs have remained stable.
   # CAD s/p CABG: EKG without signs of active ischemia, two sets of
   enzymes negative.
   - continue ASA, Plavix, statin

","The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of stroke and right hemiplegia presenting with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension. She has been admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis, which initially met SIRS criteria with a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, white blood cell count of 26,000, hypoxia, and hypotension. The source of sepsis is suspected to be aspiration pneumonia given her CT evidence of bilateral opacities. 

The patient is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam (Zosyn) for nursing home acquired pneumonia. Flagyl was initially started for empiric C. difficile coverage, but it was stopped as there were no findings of colitis on CT abdomen. 

The patient also has other medical conditions including CHF/vol overload, coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), stroke with aphasia, depression, and a right iliac artery pseudoaneurysm. 

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient will continue on vancomycin and Zosyn for nursing home acquired pneumonia for a 10-day course. Follow-up blood and urine cultures will be sent, as well as a sputum culture. Trend WBC count fever curve.
2. CHF/vol overload: The patient may consider gentle diuresis starting with 20 mg IV lasix"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of stroke, resulting in right-sided hemiparesis and aphasia. She presents with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension. The patient initially met SIRS criteria and required vasopressor support. CT evidence suggests bilateral opacities, indicating pneumonia. The patient has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics, but there is a suspicion of central venous line infection as well. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Sepsis: Given the patient's initial presentation with SIRS criteria and ongoing hypotension, there is a risk of ongoing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is crucial.
2. CHF/volume overload: The patient's hypoxia and fluid balance data suggest volume overload, which could lead to further development of congestive heart failure symptoms.
3. Pneumonia: The presence of bilateral opacities on the CT scan indicates pneumonia. Continuing appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitoring for any deterioration in respiratory status is important.
4. Central venous line infection: Suspected source of infection based on CT evidence. Regular assessment of the central venous line and appropriate management if infection is confirmed.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of right internal jugular vein (RIJ) and right subclavian vein (RSC) DVT. Monitoring for signs of DVT and appropriate"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of stroke and right hemiparesis. She presents with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension. The patient initially met SIRS criteria but is now requiring vasopressor support at 0.01. The suspected current source of sepsis is pneumonia, as evidenced by bilateral opacities on CT scan.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.7°C (98°F)
- Heart rate: 103 bpm (range: 73-103 bpm)
- Blood pressure: 140/58 mmHg (range: 78-154/41-95 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 15 breaths per minute (range: 13-27 breaths per minute)
- Oxygen saturation: 94% on nasal cannula

The patient's physical examination reveals a well-healed sternotomy scar, well-healed right-sided chest scar, diminished peripheral pulses, and diminished breath sounds in both lung fields. Neurological examination shows R hemiplegia.

Laboratory results indicate:
- White blood cell count: 14.4 K/uL (range: 11.7-26.8 K/uL)
- Hematocrit: 30.8% (range: 32.6-40.4%)

   78F with h/o stroke with R hemiparesis and aphasia presents with
   hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension
   # Sepsis - Patient  initially on admission met SIRS criteria with T101,
   WBC 26, hypoxia, and hypotension. Was weaned off pressor support
   yesterday am. Suspected current source is aspiration pna given her CT
   evidence of bilateral opacities.  On vacn and zosyn (day 1 = [**2-1**]),
   flagyl was initially started for empiric C diff coverage however given
   the lack of diarrhea of findings of colitis on CT abdomen it was
   stopped..
   - Broad spectrum antiobiotics: Will continue Vanc and Zosyn for nursing
   home acquired pna.
   - Follow-up blood and urine cultures.  Send a sputum culture.
   - Trend WBC count fever curve.
   # CHF/vol overload: EF unknown.  CT chest showed pulmonary edema with
   effusion.
   - As her SBPs have been stable, can consider gentle diuresis starting
   with 20 mg IV lasix for a goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative today.
   - TTE ordered
   - can consider restarting her acei if her BPs remain stable today.
   # CAD s/p CABG: EKG without signs of active ischemia, two sets of
   enzymes negative.
   - continue ASA, Plavix, statin
   - can consider restarting metoprolol today if her BPs remain stable
   today
   # stroke with aphasia: bilateral lower lobe pna suspicious for
   aspiration.  Speech and swallow exam ordered to assess aspiration risk.

","The patient is an elderly female with a history of stroke, right hemiplegia, and expressive aphasia. She presents with hypoxia, volume overload/CHF, and hypotension. The patient initially met SIRS criteria with a temperature of 101°F, white blood cell count of 26, hypoxia, and hypotension. She was weaned off pressor support yesterday morning. Suspected current source of sepsis is aspiration pneumonia given her CT evidence of bilateral opacities. The patient was started on vancomycin and piperacillin for nursing home acquired pneumonia. Flagyl was initially started for empiric C. difficile coverage but was stopped due to lack of diarrhea and findings of colitis on CT abdomen.

The patient has several medical conditions and complications. She has severe vascular calcifications, a right groin pseudoaneurysm at the confluence of the aorto-femoral graft and native artery, an indeterminant 4.4 cm left adrenal mass, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. She also has evidence of bilateral lower lobe opacities with dense consolidation opacification of the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, concerning for pneumonia. Additionally, she has pulmonary edema with effusions.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/58 mmHg to 154/95 mmH"

","Summary:
The patient is a 78-year-old female with a history of CVA and right hemi-paresis. She was admitted with hypoxia and hypotension, presumed to be related to sepsis from a pulmonary source of infection/inflammation with aspiration event. Over the past 24 hours, she has shown a relatively rapid improvement consistent with a response to initial intervention.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of sepsis needs to be closely monitored and managed. She is already receiving appropriate antibiotics (Vanco/Zosyn) and her pressors have been weaned off. However, she should continue to be observed for any signs of deterioration or worsening infection.

2. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure): The patient's chest CT and symptoms are consistent with effusions, indicating possible heart failure. She will need to continue with negative fluid balance, restart ACE-I, and continue monitoring for any signs of worsening heart failure.

3. CVA (Cerebrovascular Accident/Stroke): The patient has a history of CVA, which puts her at risk for further complications. Close management of potential complications such as aspiration pneumonia and careful monitoring of her neurological status are crucial.

4. Pneumonia: The patient's presentation suggests a possible pulmonary source of infection. She may be at risk for developing pneumonia, especially considering her history of aspiration. Close monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate respiratory support may be necessary.
