   Chief Complaint: PNA, critical AS
   24 Hour Events:
   - RT continued to suction moderate amounts of bloody secretions from ET
   tube and Hct decreased from 33.4 to 28.6.  Patient was transfused 1 u
   FFP and 1 u pRBC.
   - Patient
s PEEP decreased from 10 to 5 and later tried on pressure
   support, which she briefly tolerated before becoming more uncomfortable
   and she was placed back on CMV
   - She became transiently hypotensive with systolic BPs in the 100
   when she received propofol bolus and bag-mask ventilation; now resolved
   with SBP in 120

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, COPD, and pneumonia, who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She is currently intubated and sedated, and has been receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 130/65 to 155/76 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her temperature is slightly below normal at 35.7°C.

The patient has received transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells due to bloody secretions being suctioned from her endotracheal tube and a decrease in hematocrit. She has also been on various medications including propofol, famotidine, lorazepam, vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and prednisone.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Her blood cultures are growing yeast only. The patient has mild left hydronephrosis and an episode of pulmonary hemorrhage. Her urine output is low, and she has a history of autoimmune hepatitis.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory failure - The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from apparent right lower lobe pneumonia, pulmonary edema due to syst"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and bacteremia. She was admitted to the ICU due to difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation and a possible valvuloplasty. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications, including respiratory failure, pulmonary edema, right lower lobe (RLL) pleural effusion, pulmonary hemorrhage, bacteremia, renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and COPD exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing respiratory failure, which is multifactorial and may be caused by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, RLL pleural effusion, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema, which may be secondary to systolic heart failure.
3. RLL Pleural Effusion: The patient has a significant RLL pleural effusion that was drained via thoracentesis. The cause of the effusion is unclear, and cultures are pending.
4. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The patient had an episode of pulmonary hemorrhage, possibly related to anticoagulation therapy.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia, likely originating from the lungs due to recent pneumonia.
6. Renal Failure: The patient"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia who is currently admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient requires intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure and is also experiencing acute kidney injury (ARF), bacteremia, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include:

1. Critical aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has a reported critical AS on TTE at OSH. This condition may lead to syncope, angina, or even sudden cardiac arrest if not managed properly.

2. Acute kidney injury (ARF): The patient has mild left hydronephrosis at OSH and is being evaluated for pre-renal azotemia, aortic stenosis, antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity, or obstruction. If left untreated, ARF can progress to chronic kidney disease or require dialysis.

3. Bacteremia: The patient's source of bacteremia is unclear, but it is likely pulmonary given the recent pneumonia. Failure to treat bacteremia may lead to sepsis and septic shock.

4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may be related to autoimmune hepatitis or cirrhosis. Close monitoring of liver"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure and impaired skin integrity. The patient is on invasive ventilation, arterial line, and multi-lumen catheter.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on invasive ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection caused by bacteria.

2. Pressure ulcers: Impaired skin integrity increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, also known as bedsores. These ulcers can occur due to prolonged periods of immobility and increased pressure on certain areas of the body.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The use of multi-lumen catheters and immobilization in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT, which is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein.

4. Nosocomial infections: The patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive procedures increase the risk of nosocomial infections, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or surgical site infections.

5. Delirium: Critically ill patients in the ICU are at risk of developing delirium, which is a sudden change in mental status characterized by confusion, disorientation, and agitation.

6. Medication errors: With multiple medications and infusions being administered, there is a risk of medication errors, such as incorrect dosages or administration of the wrong medication.

   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Patient appears to have been treated with full course of vanc/CTX.
   D/c zosyn and vanc once this is confirmed.
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Monitor Hct q6h
   - Gentle diuresis to run her even
   - F/u final read of CT chest
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated
   - Intubate x 13 days, may need to have trach
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD
   .
   # Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of hospital stay at
   [**Hospital1 **] with hx of vegetation on aortic valve (not on current TTE).
   - Start PCN for Strep Viridans.
   - ID consult for treatment course and f/u as outpatient for
   endocarditis.
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of possible evaluation for valvuloplasty
   - not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - hold off on nitrates.
   - gentle lasix for goal even
   .
   # ARF - no known renal dysfunction.  found to have mild left
   hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by urology with plan to follow
   clinically.  ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic
   stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine lytes suggest
   pre-renal etiology.
   - follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for
   UOP<30cc/hr.
   .
   # transaminitis - h/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  abdominal usn and ct abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Lipase not elevated
   - trend LFTs
   - Send lipase and trigs.
   .
   # thrombocytopenia - more likely [**12-31**] underlying liver disease, now with
   reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  ddx also includes DIC,
   HUS/TTP given mild ARF, and HITT, though time course is unclear (he
   received heparin sc tid and lovenox at OSH)
   - check smear to r/o schistocytes (ARF, anemia, thrombocytopenia).
   - check DIC labs.
   - check for HIT.
   .
   # COPD - unclear baseline [**Name (NI) 4232**], but not on home O2.  no clear wheezing
   on exam presently, so feel COPD less likely.
   - taper prednisone 60mg po qdaily to 50mg x3d.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   - obtain OSH [**Name (NI) 4232**] in AM.
   .
   # h/o aortic valvular thrombus - chronically anticoagulated, though
   held in the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrage (though only
   received 1U PRBC for this at OSH).   no thrombus seen on his recent TTE
   at OSH.
   - hold lovenox/coumadin for now, discuss with cardiology based on
   repeat TTE here.
   - cardiology consult following echo.
   .
   # sacral decub - pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - air mattress.
   - wound care consult.
   .
   # h/o hyponatremia - resolved presently
   - trend na daily.
   .
   # OA - receiving morphine 2mg po prn pain.  per husband, she takes
   percocet at home for pain, but he is unsure where.  a rheumatology note
   indicates she takes percocet for chronic intermittent chest wall pain.
   - continue morphine 0.5mg iv q6hr prn pain.
   .
   # anxiety - per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and
   receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
   - continue prn ativan, and monitor for s/sx of withdrawl.
   .
   # elevated FSBS - no known history of DM,  but on steroids, with
   elevated FSBS.
   - cover with HISS.
   .
   # h/o SVT
 monitor on tele
   .
   # HTN - hold lisinopril given ARF, avoid nitro gtt given AS.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Cont vanc/zosyn for tx of PNA pending final sputum cx
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Monitor Hct q6h
   - Holding off on further diuresis given concern for critical AS.
   - F/u final read of CT chest
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of possible evaluation for valvuloplasty;
   not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - hold off on further diuresis, nitrates.
   .
   # ARF - no known renal dysfunction.  found to have mild left
   hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by urology with plan to follow
   clinically.  ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic
   stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine lytes suggest
   pre-renal etiology.
   - check UA/UCx.
   - check urine lytes.
   - renal ultrasound
   - follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for
   UOP<30cc/hr.
   .
   # bacteremia - source unclear, but likely pulmonary given recent
   pneumonia.
   - continue vancomycin.
   - TTE in AM, and consider TEE.
   .
   # transaminitis - h/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  abdominal usn and ct abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Lipase not elevated
   - trend LFTs
   - repeat abdominal usn in AM.
   .
   # thrombocytopenia - more likely [**12-31**] underlying liver disease, now with
   reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  ddx also includes DIC,
   HUS/TTP given mild ARF, and HITT, though time course is unclear (he
   received heparin sc tid and lovenox at OSH)
   - check smear to r/o schistocytes (ARF, anemia, thrombocytopenia).
   - check DIC labs.
   - check for HIT.
   .
   # COPD - unclear baseline [**Name (NI) 4232**], but not on home O2.  no clear wheezing
   on exam presently, so feel COPD less likely.
   - taper prednisone 60mg po qdaily to 50mg x3d.
   - continue albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   - obtain OSH [**Name (NI) 4232**] in AM.
   .
   # h/o aortic valvular thrombus - chronically anticoagulated, though
   held in the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrage (though only
   received 1U PRBC for this at OSH).   no thrombus seen on his recent TTE
   at OSH.
   - hold lovenox/coumadin for now, discuss with cardiology in AM based on
   repeat TTE here.
   - cardiology consult following echo.
   .
   # sacral decub - pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - air mattress.
   - wound care consult.
   .
   # h/o hyponatremia - resolved presently
   - trend na daily.
   .
   # OA - receiving morphine 2mg po prn pain.  per husband, she takes
   percocet at home for pain, but he is unsure where.  a rheumatology note
   indicates she takes percocet for chronic intermittent chest wall pain.
   - continue morphine 0.5mg iv q6hr prn pain.
   .
   # anxiety - per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and
   receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
   - continue prn ativan, and monitor for s/sx of withdrawl.
   .
   # elevated FSBS - no known history of DM,  but on steroids, with
   elevated FSBS.
   - cover with HISS.
   .
   # h/o SVT
 monitor on tele
   .
   # HTN - hold lisinopril given ARF, avoid nitro gtt given AS.
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia
hold home statin given transaminitis.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for difficulty weaning off the ventilator and consideration of valvuloplasty.

The patient's current condition includes:
- Respiratory failure: Multifactorial, with contributions from pneumonia, pulmonary edema due to systolic congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
- Critical aortic stenosis: Unclear baseline functional status, no regular angina or syncope.
- Acute renal failure (ARF): No known renal dysfunction, mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and planned urology consultation.
- Bacteremia: Source unclear, likely pulmonary given recent pneumonia.
- Transaminitis: History of autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear. Normal LFTs on admission to OSH and on discharge. Abdominal ultrasound (US) and CT abdomen/pelvis at OSH without evidence of right upper quadrant (RUQ) process.
- Thrombocytopenia: More likely underlying liver disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).
- COPD: Unclear baseline, but not on home oxygen. No clear wheezing on exam presently.
- History of aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated, though held in the setting of significant pulmonary hemorrhage. No thrombus seen on recent TTE at OSH.
- Sacral decubitus ulcer: Stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not probe to bone.
- Hyponatremia: Resolved presently.
- Osteoarthritis: Receiving morphine for pain management.
- Anxiety: Receiving lorazepam for agitation.
- Elevated fasting blood sugar (FSBS): No known history of diabetes, but on steroids with elevated FSBS.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including vandocycline, piperacillin/tazobactam, propofol, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine. She is also receiving tube feeds through a nasogastric (NG) tube.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.0°C, heart rate of 72 beats per minute, blood pressure of 167/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH of 7.45, partial pressure of carbon dioxide"

   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial, with contributions from
   apparent RLL PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring
   intermittent diuresis, RLL pleural effusion s/p 800cc thoracentesis
   (culture data not available), and an episode of pulmonary hemorhhage
   felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation.  Overnight she did not tolerate PS trial due
   to discomfort, but oxygenation has been adequate.  Bloody secretions
   suctioned overnight suggest that pulmonary bleed may be intermittently
   continuing.  Sputum culture growing yeast only.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Patient appears to have been treated with full course of vanc/CTX.
   D/c zosyn and vanc.
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.

   # Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of hospital stay at
   [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows posterior
   MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Start PCN for Strep viridans
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - Gentle lasix for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or inotropy
   .
   # ARF: No known renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up. Found
   to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with plan
   to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but
   did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well
   as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation and possible valvuloplasty. The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, endocarditis, acute renal failure (ARF), transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema due to systolic congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has blood cultures positive for pansensitive Strep viridans, and a posterior MV leaflet endocarditis is seen on TTE.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and evidence of pre-renal azotemia. The differential diagnosis includes aortic stenosis, antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity, urinary tract infection, and obstruction.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes and a history of autoimmune hepatitis. The differential diagnosis includes congestive hepatopathy and alcoholic liver disease.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which could be due to underlying liver disease, sepsis, or he"

   TTE: The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
   ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is unusually
   small. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%).
   The right ventricular cavity is dilated with focal hypokinesis of the
   apical free wall. The aortic valve leaflets are severely
   thickened/deformed. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened.
   There is a large globular mass on the posterior mitral valve leaflet.
   There is severe mitral annular calcification. There is moderate
   thickening of the mitral valve chordae. There is mild functional mitral
   stenosis due to mitral annular calcification. Moderate (2+) mitral
   regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of
   mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The supporting
   structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic. There is
   moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
   pericardial effusion.
   Compared with the findings of the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2178-10-20**], the left atrial myxoma is no longer present. There is
   now a mass on the posterior mitral leaflet consistent with
   endocarditis.
   ABD U/S:
   1. Gallbladder sludge with wall thickening, which may be secondary to
   the
   patient's low albumin. No cholelithiasis. No specific sign of
   cholecystitis.
   2. Urothelial thickening involving the renal pelves bilaterally, right
   greater than left, and given the bilateral findings, this may represent
   chronic urinary tract infections, particularly fungal. Clinical
   correlation
   is recommended. Also increased echogenicity of the kidneys bilaterally,
   likely reflecting chronic medical renal disease.
   3. Subtle diffuse hepatic nodularity, suggesting the possibility of
   chronic
   liver disease.
   4. Bilateral pleural effusions and minimal ascites.
   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring
   intermittent diuresis and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative
   fluid via R thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**]
   anticoagulation and ?trauma with lingular abrasion; continuing to
   suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only yeast to date.
   - Patient was treated with full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Cte PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status and
   endocarditis
   - Gentle lasix with gtt for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube and guaiac positive
   stools.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - check hemolysis labs and retic
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Given + yeast in UA and radiologic finding suggestive of possible
   fungal UTI change foley, repeat UCx today if persists will rx.
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis->will check labs today
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   last pm. Would use this again if necessary.

   Disposition:ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to the ICU for pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has been diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, anemia, acute renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial with contributions from severe COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary edema secondary to systolic heart failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. She has been treated with full courses of antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient's blood cultures have grown pansensitive Streptococcus salivarius, and she is being started on a 6-week course of penicillin for this.

The patient's anemia may be due to bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube and guaiac-positive stools. Renal function is impaired, and the patient is on hemodialysis. The transaminitis could be related to autoimmune hepatitis, congestive hepatopathy, or an autoimmune process. Thrombocytopenia is likely due to underlying liver disease and reactive to bacteremia and pneumonia.

The patient has a history of aortic valvular thrombus but no thrombus is seen on TTE. She has a new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer"

   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Patient appears to have been treated with full course of vanc/CTX.
   D/c zosyn and vanc.
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD
   - F/u final read of CT chest
   # Hypertension: Likely underlying essential hypertension exacerbated by
   anxiety as resolved when fell asleep.
   - gentle diuresis for fluid goal of even- to slightly positive
   .
   # Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of hospital stay at
   [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows posterior
   MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Start PCN for Strep viridans
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - Gentle lasix for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   .
   # ARF: No known renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up. Found
   to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with plan
   to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but
   did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well
   as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Given + yeast in UA and radiologic finding suggestive of possible
   fungal UTI, consider ID consult for appropriate drug in this patient
   with mild transaminitis

   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above

   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.

   exacerbation of COPD less likely.
   - Taper prednisone 60mg po qdaily to 50mg x3d.
   - Continue albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   - Consider obtaining OSH [**Name (NI) 4232**]

   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on his recent TTE at OSH or
   here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia who is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has been treated with antibiotics and intubated. The patient has several medical complications including endocarditis, acute renal failure (ARF), transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, sacral decubitus ulcer, hyponatremia, osteoarthritis, anxiety, elevated fasting blood sugar (FSBS), and a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient's current medications include penicillin G, furosemide, fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which requires mechanical ventilation and careful monitoring.
2. Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive for pansensitive Streptococcus salivarius, indicating possible endocarditis. The patient requires treatment with penicillin for this condition.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient has an elevated creatinine level and is showing signs of renal dysfunction. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
4. Transaminitis: The patient has elevated liver enzymes, which may indicate liver dysfunction or"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has several medical conditions and potential complications:

1. Arterial line complications: The patient had an arterial line placed and subsequently developed a blood infection (bacteremia) with Streptococcus salivarius, which is sensitive to penicillin. This indicates a potential risk for endocarditis or sepsis.

2. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulation profile shows prolonged PTT and low fibrinogen levels. This may indicate a bleeding tendency or the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

3. Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer that was present at admission. This indicates potential pressure injury or bed sore, which requires regular turning and pressure relief.

4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated in the 210s/120s range. This could be due to stress, pain, medication side effects, or underlying chronic hypertension.

5. Hypokalemia: The patient's potassium levels are low, indicating hypokalemia. This can cause muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and other electrolyte imbalances.

6. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a high tidal volume (380 mL) and moderate PEEP (10 cmH2O). The ABG results show a slightly elevated PaCO2 and low pH, suggesting hypoventilation or inadequate ventilation.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Patient appears to have been treated with full course of vanc/CTX.
   D/c zosyn and vanc.
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD
   - F/u final read of CT chest
   .
   # Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of hospital stay at
   [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows posterior
   MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Start PCN for Strep viridans
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - Gentle lasix for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or inotropy
   .
   # ARF: No known renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up. Found
   to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with plan
   to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but
   did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well
   as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - F/u urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema on CT chest with unclear baseline [**Name (NI) 4232**] but not
   on home O2.  No clear wheezing on exam presently, so feel acute
   exacerbation of COPD less likely.
   - Taper prednisone 60mg po qdaily to 50mg x3d.
   - Continue albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   - Consider obtaining OSH [**Name (NI) 4232**]
   .
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on his recent TTE at OSH or
   here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards
   .
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # H/o hyponatremia: Resolved presently
   - Trend Na daily.
   .
   # OA: Receiving morphine 2mg po prn pain.  Per husband, she takes
   percocet at home for pain, but he is unsure where.  A rheumatology note
   indicates she takes percocet for chronic intermittent chest wall pain.
   - Continue morphine 0.5mg IV q6hr prn pain.
   .
   # Anxiety: Per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and
   receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
   - Continue prn ativan, and monitor for s/sx of withdrawl.
   .
   # Elevated FSBS: No known history of DM, with elevated FSBS on steroids
   - Cover with HISS
   .
   # H/o SVT: Monitor on tele
   .
   # HTN: Holding lisinopril given ARF; avoid nitro or neg inotropes given
   AS
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding home statin given transaminitis.

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for the patient:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure. There is a concern for pneumonia, pulmonary edema secondary to systolic heart failure, and pulmonary hemorrhage. The presence of bloody secretions and yeast in sputum cultures suggests an ongoing respiratory infection.

2. Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive for Strep viridans, which is sensitive to penicillin. The patient has a positive TTE showing posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. This indicates a possible infection of the heart valves.

3. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS on TTE. There is uncertainty regarding her baseline functional status, and she does not have regular angina or syncope. There is a plan to notify cards on Monday for evaluation for possible valvuloplasty.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's creatinine level is elevated and trending up. There is evidence of left hydronephrosis at OSH, suggesting potential obstruction. The differential diagnosis includes pre-renal azotemia, aortic stenosis, antibiotics-induced nephrotoxicity, and obstruction.

5. Transaminitis: The patient has a history of autoimmune hepatitis, but the baseline is unclear. Liver function tests were normal upon admission to OSH and on discharge. There is evidence of chronic liver disease"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o aortic stenosis, COPD, admitted to OSH with pneumonia,
   complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, ARF,
   transferred for difficulty weaning and question of valvuloplasty.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   PNA, pulmonary edema 2/2 systolic CHF requiring intermittent diuresis
   and s/p drainage 800cc reportedly transudative fluid via R
   thoracentesis at OSH, and pulmonary hemorrhage felt [**12-31**] anticoagulation
   and ?trauma. Bronch yesterday showed lingular abrasion as likely
   source; continuing to suction bloody secretions. Sputum cx growing only
   yeast to date.
   - Patient appears to have been treated with full course of vanc/CTX.
   D/c zosyn and vanc.
   - F/u OSH cx (blood, sputum, thoracentesis)
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin (also no longer e/o AV thrombus)
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Wean PEEP, trial of pressure support as tolerated. Of note, intubated
   x 13 days, and may need to have trach.
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD
   - F/u final read of CT chest
   # Hypertension: Likely underlying essential hypertension exacerbated by
   anxiety as resolved when fell asleep.
   .
   # Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of hospital stay at
   [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows posterior
   MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Start PCN for Strep viridans
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   .
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Will notify Cards on Monday of evaluation for possible valvuloplasty
   - Not candidate for AV replacement given clinical status
   - Gentle lasix for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or inotropy
   .
   # ARF: No known renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up. Found
   to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with plan
   to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but
   did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well
   as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - F/u urine cx
   .
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above
   .
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   .
   # COPD: Severe emphysema on CT chest with unclear baseline [**Name (NI) 4232**] but not
   on home O2.  No clear wheezing on exam presently, so feel acute
   exacerbation of COPD less likely.
   - Taper prednisone 60mg po qdaily to 50mg x3d.
   - Continue albuterol, atrovent inhalers.
   - Consider obtaining OSH [**Name (NI) 4232**]
   .
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on his recent TTE at OSH or
   here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards
   .
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # H/o hyponatremia: Resolved presently
   - Trend Na daily.
   .
   # OA: Receiving morphine 2mg po prn pain.  Per husband, she takes
   percocet at home for pain, but he is unsure where.  A rheumatology note
   indicates she takes percocet for chronic intermittent chest wall pain.
   - Continue morphine 0.5mg IV q6hr prn pain.
   .
   # Anxiety: Per husband, takes anti-anxiety medications at home, and
   receiving lorazepam 0.5-2mg q1hr prn agitation at OSH.
   - Continue prn ativan, and monitor for s/sx of withdrawl.
   .
   # Elevated FSBS: No known history of DM, with elevated FSBS on steroids
   - Cover with HISS
   .
   # H/o SVT: Monitor on tele
   .
   # HTN: Holding lisinopril given ARF; avoid nitro or neg inotropes given
   AS
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia: Holding home statin given transaminitis.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and endocarditis. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation and potential valvuloplasty.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has likely multifactorial respiratory failure with contributions from pneumonia, pulmonary edema due to systolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary hemorrhage. She is still experiencing bloody secretions, and sputum cultures are growing only yeast.
2. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension is likely underlying essential hypertension exacerbated by anxiety, which resolved when she fell asleep.
3. Endocarditis: Blood cultures are positive for pansensitive Streptococcus salivarius, and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) shows posterior mitral valve leaflet endocarditis. The patient will start penicillin for Strep viridans and receive an infectious disease consultation for treatment and outpatient follow-up.
4. Aortic stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS on TTE, and it is unclear about her baseline functional status. She does not have regular angina or syncope. The patient will be evaluated for possible valvuloplasty and will not be a candidate for aortic valve replacement given her clinical"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly tried
   on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable, bradycardia, with
   ABG 7.45/48/63.  Continues to have bloody secretions.  Sputum cultures
   only with yeast to date.
   - Increase sedation for comfort
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - To receive trach, hopefully today with IP
   - Plan on DDAVP prior to trach
   - F/u cx
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  EKG
s have been unchanged
   to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - f/u ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - appreciate cardiology consult today regarding possible interventions,
   she appears to not be a candidate for AV replacement given clinical
   status and endocarditis
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube, oozing from picc site,
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis,
   likely due to mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low,
   likely due to critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Cx with yeast -> foley changed.
   - f/u urine cx
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   HTN. Would use this again if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and mitral valve endocarditis. She was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, anemia, acute renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of aortic valvular thrombus. She also has a new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and is currently intubated. There are multiple factors contributing to her respiratory failure, including atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The patient's comfort should be increased with sedation, and she will receive a tracheostomy today.
2. Anemia: The patient has bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube and oozing from the PICC line site. She also has a positive guaiac test in her stools. Hemolysis labs indicate active red cell lysis, likely due to mitral valve vegetation. The patient's hct is stable at 30, and she should have her hct cycled to ensure stability.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient has an elevated creatinine level and mild left hydronephrosis. There are several potential causes for her ARF, including pre-"

The patient has a history of allergies to no known drugs. They have received antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and penicillin G potassium.

The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 54 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/51 mmHg to 172/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate set at 18 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC), hemoglobin (Hct), and platelet count (Plt). The creatinine (Cr) levels are within normal range, while total carbon dioxide (TCO2) levels are slightly elevated. Glucose levels are also high.

The patient has been receiving various medications including fentanyl, midazolam, pantoprazole, and others. They have a Foley catheter in place for urine culture, which grew yeast. The patient's peripheral pulses, skin, and neurologic"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly tried
   on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable with ABG 7.45/48/63.
   Continues to have bloody secretions.  Sputum cultures only with yeast
   to date.
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - To receive trach today with IP
   - F/u cx
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  EKG
s have been unchanged
   to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - appreciate cardiology consult today regarding possible interventions,
   she appears to not be s candidate for AV replacement given clinical
   status and endocarditis
   - Gentle lasix with gtt for goal even
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube, oozing from picc site,
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis,
   likely due to mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low,
   likely due to critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - f/u urine cx
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - F/u LFTs today and trend
   - Gentle diuresis as above
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis->will check labs today
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   last pm. Would use this again if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She required intubation due to hypoxic respiratory failure and was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS. The patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis and is currently on full course of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's conditions include respiratory failure, mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, anemia, acute renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of aortic valvular thrombus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure likely due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The patient continues to have bloody secretions and previous attempts at weaning off the ventilator have been unsuccessful.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive S. salivarius, indicating an infection of the mitral valve. This requires long-term antibiotic therapy and may require surgical intervention.
3. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which may require valvuloplasty or replacement of the aortic valve. However, the patient's clinical status and end"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS. She was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, anemia, acute renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of aortic valvular thrombus. She also has a new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer and hypertension.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. She has been receiving full courses of vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for hospital-acquired pneumonia. A tracheostomy is planned today with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (IP). Daily follow-up chest X-rays are needed.
2. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive Strep salivarius. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) showed posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. A cardiology consult is required regarding possible interventions, considering her clinical status and endocarditis"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly tried
   on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable, bradycardia, with
   ABG 7.45/48/63.  Continues to have bloody secretions.  Sputum cultures
   only with yeast to date.
   - Trach and PEG today with IP
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - Plan on DDAVP prior to trach
   - F/u cx
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   #Leukocytosis- Has been creeping up for last 24 hours, with significant
   increase today.  No obvious source.
   - CXR today
   - send blood and urine cx
   - f/u imaging to evaluate for dental abscess
   - check c. diff
   - pull central line
   - consider abdominal CT per ID recs
   #Hypernatremia- Difficult to assess fluid status in this patient,
   however given her prolonged intubation she may be taking in inadequate
   free water.
   - increase free water flushes for TF
   - recheck Na this pm
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  EKG
s have been unchanged
   to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Hold on diuresis for now
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 48 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube, oozing from picc site,
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis,
   likely due to mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low,
   likely due to critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now 1.9 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by
   Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report
   hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic
   UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx after
   foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   HTN. Would use this again if necessary.

She also has a sacral decubitus ulcer and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and there is a concern for ongoing difficulty weaning her off the ventilator due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The presence of bloody secretions and yeast in sputum cultures may indicate an ongoing infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing, suggesting a possible infection. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, which could be due to inadequate free water intake. This may be related to her prolonged intubation.
4. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive S. salivarius, and a TTE showing posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. She requires an extended course of penicillin for Strep salivarius per"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly tried
   on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable, bradycardia, with
   ABG 7.45/48/63.  Continues to have bloody secretions.  Sputum cultures
   only with yeast to date.
   - Increase sedation for comfort
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - To receive trach, hopefully today with IP
   - Plan on DDAVP prior to trach
   - F/u cx
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   #Leukocytosis- Has been creeping up for last 24 hours, with significant
   increase today.  No obvious source.
   - CXR today
   - send blood and urine cx
   - f/u imaging to evaluate for dental abscess
   - check c. diff
   - pull central line
   - consider abdominal CT per ID recs
   #Hypernatremia- Difficult to assess fluid status in this patient,
   however given her prolonged intubation she may be taking in inadequate
   free water.
   - increase free water flushes for TF
   - recheck Na this pm
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  EKG
s have been unchanged
   to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - f/u ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - appreciate cardiology consult today regarding possible interventions,
   she appears to not be a candidate for AV replacement given clinical
   status and endocarditis
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube, oozing from picc site,
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis,
   likely due to mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low,
   likely due to critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Cx with yeast -> foley changed.
   - f/u urine cx
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   HTN. Would use this again if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and pneumonia who was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure. She required intubation and was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS. The patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. She continues to have bloody secretions, and her white blood cell count has been creeping up for the last 24 hours with a significant increase today. She also has hypernatremia and anemia with active red cell lysis likely due to mitral valve vegetations. The patient has renal failure, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, a history of autoimmune hepatitis, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure likely due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. She was briefly tried on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable, bradycardia, with ABG 7.45/48/63. Continuous bloody secretions and yeast in sputum cultures suggest possible fungal infection.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing steadily, indicating an infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly tried
   on PEEP of 6 yesterday but appeared uncomfortable, bradycardia, with
   ABG 7.45/48/63.  Continues to have bloody secretions.  Sputum cultures
   only with yeast to date.
   - Increase sedation for comfort
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - To receive trach, hopefully today with IP
   - Plan on DDAVP prior to trach
   - F/u cx
   - Cycle Hct to ensure stable
   - Holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  EKG
s have been unchanged
   to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**])
   - f/u ID consult for treatment course and outpt f/u of endocarditis
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - appreciate cardiology consult today regarding possible interventions,
   she appears to not be a candidate for AV replacement given clinical
   status and endocarditis
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Hypernatremia:
   # Anemia:  Has bloody secretions from ET tube, oozing from picc site,
   guaiac positive stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis,
   likely due to mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low,
   likely due to critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts [**Hospital1 **]
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up.
   Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with
   plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis
   but did have urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as
   well as chronic renal dysfunction. Ddx currently includes pre-renal [**12-31**]
   diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction. Urine
   lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Cx with yeast -> foley changed.
   - f/u urine cx
   # Transaminitis: H/o autoimmune hepatitis, baseline unclear.  LFTs
   normal on admission to OSH, and on discharge ALT 49, AST AST 51,
   amylase 238.  Abdominal U/S and CT abd/pelvis at OSH without evidence
   of RUQ process, though elevated INR and low albumin suggest cirrhosis.
   Abd u/s here suggests chronic liver disease. Pt currently w/o RUQ pain.
   Ddx includes congestive hepatopathy and autoimmune process.
   - Trend LFTs
   - Holding statin
   # Thrombocytopenia: Stably decreased. Likely [**12-31**] underlying liver
   disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and pneumonia.  Ddx
   also includes HITT. No schistocytes on smear to suggest [**Doctor First Name 2674**], and DIC
   unlikely with INR normalizing off coumadin and fibrinogen >100.
   - F/u HIT Ab
   - Consider hemolysis from endocarditis
   # H/o aortic valvular thrombus: Chronically anticoagulated but held in
   the setting of significant pulmonary hemhorrhage (though only received
   1U PRBC for this at OSH). No thrombus seen on TTE at OSH or here.
   - Systemic anticoagulation discontinued; can consider d/w Cards utility
   of continuing anti-coagulation when stable
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - F/u wound care recs
   .
   # HTN: Worsens in setting of anxiety. Holding lisinopril given ARF;
   avoid nitro or neg inotropes given AS. Labetolol was effective for her
   HTN. Would use this again if necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure (ARF), and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been experiencing bloody secretions, positive yeast in sputum cultures, and positive blood cultures growing pansensitive Strep salivarius. She also has critical aortic stenosis, hypernatremia, anemia, ARF, transaminitis, thrombocytopenia, and a history of autoimmune hepatitis. Additionally, she has a sacral decubitus ulcer and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing respiratory failure, which is likely multifactorial. It may be caused by severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive Strep salivarius and evidence of mitral valve endocarditis on echocardiogram. She requires a prolonged course of penicillin and close follow-up with an infectious disease specialist.
3. Anemia: The patient has ongoing bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube, oozing from the percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line site, and guaiac-positive stools. Hemolysis"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pneumonia. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure (ARF), and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been receiving full courses of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia and Strep salivarius endocarditis. She is planned for tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) today, as well as valvuloplasty if there is no clinical improvement in the next 48 hours. The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and sacral decubitus ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing difficulty weaning from mechanical ventilation, and there are ongoing bloody secretions despite receiving full courses of antibiotics. This suggests an ongoing infection or another underlying cause for her respiratory failure.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been increasing over the past 24 hours, indicating a potential ongoing infection or inflammatory response.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient with
   uneventful placement of trach and PEG yesterday after 1 dose DDAVP.
   - Transition to PS as more comfortable when able to pull in larger Vt
   spontaneously
   - S/p full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - Resent sputum cx, f/u pending cx
   - Hct daily to ensure stable, holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today with goal net neg over 24 h
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 2 of
   40mg prednisone)
   #Leukocytosis: Decrease from 27 to 23. Central line d/c
ed.  CXR
   revealed slight increase in R pleural effusion, no consolidation.
   Urine legionella negative, remainder of cx with NGTD.
   - Cont PCN for S. salivarius
   - F/u pending cx, C. diff sent today (BM with suppository)
   - Resend sputum and surveillance bcx
   - Per ID recs, consider imaging of oral cavity for dental abscess but
   unable to obtain panorex for possible oral source. Will hold off
   further imaging for now unless spikes.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia discussed
   with cards who recommend continuing to monitor, no wire at this time.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - Surveillance blood cx; f/u micro data here and OSH
   #Hypernatremia: Improved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - Recheck Na this pm
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Gentle lasix gtt today as above
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 24 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased 2 points today s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Continues to have scant bloody secretions from ET tube, guaiac positive
   stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis, likely due to
   mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low, likely due to
   critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts daily as stable for several days
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Change IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] to po lansoprazole daily
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now stable around 2.0 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH,
   and seen by Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did
   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Stable currently. Hold diuresis as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin assay and consider other sources including hemolysis
   from the endocarditis as well
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - Continue wound care

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. She required intubation and was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to severe COPD and atalectasis. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function, which may require mechanical ventilation support.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of infection.

3. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures growing out pansensitive Strep salivarius, indicating bacterial infection of the mitral valve. This condition requires prolonged antibiotic therapy and may necessitate surgical intervention.

4. Bradycardia: The patient has sinus bradycardia, which should be monitored closely. Development of heart block is a concern, and a wire may be considered if necessary.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be corrected with increased free water flushes for TF. Regular monitoring of sodium levels is essential.

6. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit has decreased after tracheostomy and"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient with
   uneventful placement of trach and PEG yesterday after 1 dose DDAVP.
   Blood gas yesterday evening on 50% FiO2 revealed pO2 56, so FiO2
   increased to 60%, remainder of settings stable with PEEP maintained at
   10.
   - Patient has received full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - F/u cx
   - Hct daily to ensure stable, holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis to run pt even
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 2 of
   40mg prednisone)
   #Leukocytosis- Down to 23 from 27.  Central line d/c
ed.  CXR revealed
   slight increase in R pleural effusion, no consolidation.  Urine
   legionella negative, remainder of cx with NGTD.  Unable to obtain
   panorex for possible oral source.
   - f/u cx
   - per ID recs, consider imaging of oral cavity for dental abscess, CT
   abd/pelvis for further evaluation of hydronephosis
   - check c. diff
   #Hypernatremia- Improved with increased free water in TF.
   - continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - recheck Na this pm
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia discussed
   with cards who recommend continuing to monitor, no wire at this time.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope
   - Hold on diuresis for now. Fluid goal even today.
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 24 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased 2 points today s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Continues to have scant bloody secretions from ET tube, guaiac positive
   stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis, likely due to
   mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low, likely due to
   critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts daily as stable for several days
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now stable around 2.0 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH,
   and seen by Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did
   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Stable currently. Hold diuresis as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held.  Likely [**12-31**]
   underlying liver disease, now with reactive component to bacteremia and
   pneumonia but HIT antibody positive.
   - f/u serotonin assay and consider other sources including hemolysis
   from the endocarditis as well
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - continue wound care

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, pneumonia, acute respiratory failure (ARF), and mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for difficulty weaning from the ventilator and planned valvuloplasty.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. FiO2 has been increased to 60% to maintain oxygenation.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an ongoing infection. Central line catheterization has been discontinued.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved with increased free water administration. Continued free water flushes are recommended.
4. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive for pansensitive Strep salivarius. TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Bradycardia is being monitored, and a wire has not been placed at this time.
5. Anemia: Hct has decreased by 2 points today after trach and PEG placement. Bloody secretions from the ET tube and guaiac positive stools suggest ongoing bleeding. Hemolysis labs indicate active red cell lysis, likely due to mitral valve vegetation. Daily hcts are being c"

 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia discussed
   with cards who recommend continuing to monitor, no wire at this time.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - Surveillance blood cx; f/u micro data here and OSH
   #Hypernatremia: Improved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - Recheck Na this pm
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Gentle lasix gtt today as above
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 24 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased 2 points today s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Continues to have scant bloody secretions from ET tube, guaiac positive
   stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis, likely due to
   mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low, likely due to

   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is currently in the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty due to critical aortic stenosis and mitral valve endocarditis.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD and was admitted with pneumonia, which contributed to her respiratory failure. There is a concern about multifactorial causes for her respiratory failure, including atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The plan is to transition to pressure support ventilation (PSV) when the patient is more comfortable and able to pull in larger tidal volumes (Vt) spontaneously.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, initially at 27.1 K/uL and then decreased to 23.5 K/uL. This may be due to central line placement or an ongoing infection. The plan is to monitor the patient's response to antibiotics and consider further imaging of the oral cavity for a possible dental abscess.

3. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient's blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Strep salivarius on day 2 of hospitalization. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed posterior mitral"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and subsequent hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis and has undergone tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement.

The patient's current medical complications include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is likely experiencing multifactorial respiratory failure, including severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The patient's respiratory support includes a tracheostomy tube and mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 60%.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had an elevated white blood cell count, but it has decreased to 23,000 cells/mm³ from 27,000 cells/mm³. Central line removal is recommended, and further investigations should include imaging of the oral cavity for possible dental abscess and CT abdomen/pelvis for evaluation of hydronephrosis.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels have improved with increased free water in the tube feed. Continued free water flushes for tube feeding and rechecking sodium levels are advised.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient with
   uneventful placement of trach and PEG yesterday after 1 dose DDAVP.
   - Transition to PS as more comfortable when able to pull in larger Vt
   spontaneously
   - S/p full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - Resend sputum cx, f/u pending cx
   - Monitor Hct daily, holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today with goal net neg over 24 h
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 2 of
   40mg prednisone)
   #Leukocytosis: Decrease from 27 to 23. Central line d/c
ed.  CXR
   revealed slight increase in R pleural effusion, no consolidation.
   Urine legionella negative, remainder of cx with NGTD.
   - Cont PCN for S. salivarius
   - F/u pending cx, C. diff sent today (BM with suppository)
   - Resend sputum and surveillance bcx
   - Per ID recs, consider imaging of oral cavity for dental abscess but
   unable to obtain panorex for possible oral source. Will hold off
   further imaging for now unless spikes.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia discussed
   with cards who recommend continuing to monitor, no wire at this time.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - Surveillance blood cx; f/u micro data here and OSH
   #Hypernatremia: Improved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - Recheck Na this pm
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Gentle lasix gtt today as above
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 24 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased 2 points today s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Continues to have scant bloody secretions from ET tube, guaiac positive
   stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis, likely due to
   mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low, likely due to
   critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts daily as stable for several days
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Change IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] to po lansoprazole daily
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now stable around 2.0 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH,
   and seen by Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did
   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Stable currently. Hold diuresis as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin assay and consider other sources including hemolysis
   from the endocarditis as well
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - Continue wound care

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted for pneumonia.
- She required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure and was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty.
- The patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis and is currently on a prolonged course of penicillin for Strep salivarius.
- She has leukocytosis that decreased from 27 to 23 after central line removal.
- The patient's sodium levels improved with increased free water intake.
- She has anemia with a decreasing hemoglobin level due to tracheostomy and peg tube placement, as well as ongoing bloody secretions.
- The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 2.0, and urine cultures are negative for Legionella but positive for S. salivarius.
- She also has thrombocytopenia with increased platelet count after holding heparin and a positive HIT Ab.
- The patient developed a stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and the presence of atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema may contribute to respiratory failure.

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient with
   uneventful placement of trach and PEG yesterday after 1 dose DDAVP.
   - Transition to PS as more comfortable when able to pull in larger Vt
   spontaneously
   - S/p full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - Resend sputum cx, f/u pending cx
   - Monitor Hct daily, holding coumadin
   - Gentle diuresis with lasix gtt today with goal net neg over 24 h
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 2 of
   40mg prednisone)
   #Leukocytosis: Decrease from 27 to 23. Central line d/c
ed.  CXR
   revealed slight increase in R pleural effusion, no consolidation.
   Urine legionella negative, remainder of cx with NGTD.
   - Cont PCN for S. salivarius
   - F/u pending cx, C. diff sent today (BM with suppository)
   - Resend sputum and surveillance bcx
   - Per ID recs, consider imaging of oral cavity for dental abscess but
   unable to obtain panorex for possible oral source. Will hold off
   further imaging for now unless spikes.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia discussed
   with cards who recommend continuing to monitor, no wire at this time.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - Surveillance blood cx; f/u micro data here and OSH
   #Hypernatremia: Improved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - Recheck Na this pm
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Gentle lasix gtt today as above
   - Per cards recs, will consider valvuloplasty if clinical course does
   not improve over next 24 hours
   - Avoid decreasing preload or negative inotropy
   # Anemia:  Hct decreased 2 points today s/p trach and PEG placement.
   Continues to have scant bloody secretions from ET tube, guaiac positive
   stools.  Hemolysis labs suggest active red cell lysis, likely due to
   mitral valve veg.  Retic count inappropriately low, likely due to
   critical illness.
   - Cycle hcts daily as stable for several days
   - Transfuse for hct<21
   - Change IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] to po lansoprazole daily
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now stable around 2.0 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH,
   and seen by Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did
   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   - Stable currently. Hold diuresis as above.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin assay and consider other sources including hemolysis
   from the endocarditis as well
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and underwent tracheostomy and PEG placement. The patient has been diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis and has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive S. salivarius. She also has critical AS, anemia, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still dependent on mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. The ventilator settings need to be closely monitored, and weaning attempts should be made cautiously.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient's blood cultures are positive for S. salivarius, indicating an ongoing infection. She requires a prolonged course of antibiotics, and the possibility of valve replacement should be considered.
3. Critical Aortic Stenosis (AS): The patient has critical AS, which can lead to syncope, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Valvuloplasty or valve replacement may be necessary if her clinical course does not improve.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct levels are decreasing, suggesting ongoing blood loss or hemolysis. Blood transfusion may be required, and further investigation into the cause of hemolysis is needed.
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF):"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and pneumonia who was admitted to the hospital. She was transferred to the ICU due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator and for valvuloplasty to address her critical aortic stenosis. However, she was found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hypernatremia, thrombocytopenia, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The patient's hematocrit levels have slightly decreased today with ongoing bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube. She is currently +500 cc for fluid balance.

The patient has completed a full course of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia. She continues on a lasix drip for fluid management goals. A trial of pressure support ventilation will be attempted today. Blood cultures were positive on day 2 of the hospital stay, growing pansensitive Strep salivarius, and a TTE showed posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. The patient has been started on a 6-week course of penicillin for Strep salivarius per ID recommendations. Daily ECGs will be monitored for the development of heart block.

The patient also has acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   #)Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly
   tolerated PS, then changed back to AC for fatigue.  Hct slightly
   decreased today with continued bloody secretions from ET tube.  She is
   currently +500 cc
s for LOS fluid balance.
   - S/p full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - continue lasix drip for goal -500 cc
s today, check pm lytes.
   - PS trial today as tolerated
   - f/u pending cx
   - Check pm hct, transfuse for hct <21
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 2 of
   40mg prednisone)
   #Leukocytosis: Continues to decrease. Micro with yeast growing in
   sputum, c. diff negative.
   - Cont PCN for S. salivarius
   - F/u pending cx
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.  Bradycardia reserved.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - Surveillance blood cx
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   - check lytes this pm in setting of lasix gtt
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Gentle lasix gtt today as above
   - Discuss high-risk valvuloplasty with cards today
   .
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now stable around 2.0 . Found to have mild left hydronephrosis at OSH,
   and seen by Urology with plan to follow clinically. Abd U/S here did
   not report hydronephrosis but did have urothelial thickening suggesting
   chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx
   after foley change without fungus.  Ddx currently includes pre-renal
   [**12-31**] diuresis vs aortic stenosis, AIN [**12-31**] antibiotics, vs obstruction.
   Urine lytes suggest pre-renal etiology.
   - Follow UOP closely, if CVP < [**7-8**], gentle IVF boluses for UOP<30cc/hr
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin assay and consider other sources including hemolysis
   from the endocarditis as well
   # Sacral decub: Pt with new stage 2 sacral decubitus ulcer, does not
   probe to bone.
   - Air mattress.
   - Continue wound care

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS, but found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. There are multiple factors contributing to this, including severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. The patient briefly tolerated pressure support ventilation (PS) but changed back to assist-control (AC) mode due to fatigue.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient initially had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 27.1 K/uL. It continues to decrease. Microbiology results show yeast growing in sputum, but C. difficile is negative. Penicillin was continued for Strep salivarius.

3. Mitral valve endocarditis: Blood cultures were positive for pansensitive Strep salivarius, and trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Bradycardia has been reserved, and the patient will continue on a 6-week course of penicillin for Strep salivarius per Infectious Disease recommendations. Daily ECGs"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage and edema.  Patient briefly
   tolerated PS, then changed back to AC for fatigue.  Hct slowly
   decreasing today with continued bloody secretions from ET tube.  She is
   currently about even for LOS fluid balance.  Lasix drip on at 1
   overnight and off this am.
   - S/p full course of vanc/zosyn for HAP
   - i/o goal: even
   - PS trial today as tolerated
 attempt [**4-7**] pressure support
   - f/u pending cx
   - Check pm hct, transfuse for hct <21(see below)
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 3 of
   40mg prednisone)
   - transition fentanyl gtt to patch of 25 mcg/24hr, transition midaz to
   NG valium.
   # Anemia: Hct continues to slowly trend down (27 -> 24 ->22).  Sources
   include continued bloody secretions, guiaic positive stools, hemolysis
   from valve vegetation.
   - transfuse 2 u pRBC
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now growing out pansensitive S. salivarius.
   TTE shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - f/u blood cx
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Hold on lasix drip today, fluid goal even
   - Cards would consider valvuloplasty after completion of abx course
   # Hypertension: Appears to be related to agitation (sedation decreased
   yesterday, BP increases when patient stimulated)
   - consider increase in fentanyl patch
   - would not start home CCB at this time given AS
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH and trending up,
   now slowly increasing (2.0 -> 2.4) . Found to have mild left
   hydronephrosis at OSH, and seen by Urology with plan to follow
   clinically. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as
   chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx after foley change with fungus.
   Urine negative for eos.
   - MR abd to evaluate for peri-nephric abscess

   and sputum, c. diff negative.
   - Cont PCN for S. salivarius
   - F/u pending cx
   #Hypernatremia: Resolved with increased free water in TF.
   - Continue increased free water flushes for TF
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin assay

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure and atrial fibrillation. The patient underwent intubation and was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis. During her stay, she was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. She has been treated with a full course of vancomycin and zosyn for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, with contributions from severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. Her hemoglobin concentration continues to decrease, and she has bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube. She is currently even for fluid balance. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. It is crucial to closely monitor her respiratory status and provide appropriate supportive care.
2. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing, and she has bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube. This suggests ongoing blood loss, which needs to be investigated and managed promptly.
3. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has been diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis. She has positive blood cultures growing pansensitive Strep salivarius"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital with hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation, acute renal failure (ARF), and was later transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis. The patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, and edema. There is a goal to wean her off the ventilator but she has shown fatigue and change in neuro exam. This indicates ongoing respiratory support may be required.

2. RUE weakness: The patient is showing weakness in her right upper extremity, which is concerning for a possible cerebrovascular accident (cva) especially given the endocarditis. A CT head/neck is planned today without contrast.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss from bloody secretions, guaiac positive stools, and hemolysis from valve vegetation. A blood transfusion of one unit packed red blood cells is recommended.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly woman admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of cardiac valve disease and is currently on antibiotics. The patient tolerates pressure support for 8 hours but is back on rate support overnight. Her blood pressure runs higher when awake and agitated, possibly due to weaning off sedation. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate within normal limits, blood pressure slightly elevated, respiratory rate within normal limits, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 380 mL and a peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a pH of 7.48, PaCO2 of 41 mmHg, PaO2 of 264, and oxygen ventilation of 6.8 L/min.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is intubated and sedated, with dry mucous membranes and bronchial breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds, and extremities are warm and well-perfused. The patient is neurologically intact, following commands.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal limits. Blood glucose levels vary throughout the day but remain within normal limits. Electrolyte levels are within normal range except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Liver function tests are mildly abnormal, and renal function tests are within normal"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of valvuloplasty being considered after completing antibiotic therapy, and the recommendation for a CT abdomen/pelvis could not be given due to acute renal failure (ARF). The patient is currently tolerating passive range of motion (PS) for 8 hours and is back on rate for overnight. The patient's blood pressure runs higher when awake and agitated during the weaning of sedation. The patient's allergies include heparin agents and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's last dose of antibiotics was Penicillin G potassium on [**2182-5-17**] at 05:54 AM. The patient is receiving various infusions, including other ICU medications and other medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flowsheet data shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and laboratory values.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, and normal platelet count. Renal function tests show an increased creatinine level. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. Liver function tests show elevated alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Cardiac enzymes are within normal range. Other"

   MRI HEAD WET READ:
   Multiple areas of T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity scattered predominantly
   throughout both cerebellum, also in left thalamus, bilateral basal
   ganglia in
   a non-watershed distribution that is dark on ADC with restricted
   diffusion
   concerning areas of subacute infarction, in setting of endocarditis,
   septic
   emboli most likely given pattern of distribution.
   CT HEAD:
   There is a small 4.5 mm focus of high attenuation in the left
   parieto-occipital region which could represent a small punctate
   hemorrhagic
   focus. There is no mass effect, edema or herniation. There is no
   evidence of
   acute major vascular territorial infarcts; however, CT is a limited
   study for
   evaluation of acute infarct. Other areas of punctate high attenuation
   could
   reflect dural calcifications given well-circumscribed appearance.
   CT NECK: Pending
   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage, edema and  HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - i/o goal: even off lasix gtt
   - decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Cte PS at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated
   - f/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day 1 of
   30mg prednisone)
   - transition fentanyl gtt to patch of 25 mcg/24hr, transition midaz to
   NG valium.
   # Embolic CVA:
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   - F/U MRI FR
   - Not on heparin currently given persistent oozing post-trach and new
   CVA. D/W neuro best time to re-start hep gtt/coumadin.
   - LDL elevated but has transaminitis at baseline so statin not a good
   option for her. As CVA was embolic do not feel she would benefit from
   this therapy as CVA prevention but with DM may consider adding
   different class of cholesterol lowering medication in the future.
   - Will need family discussion for goals of care.
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down over course of last couple of
   days.  Sources include continued bloody secretions, guiaic positive
   stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Received one unit pRBCs with
   inappropriate bump but after second unit up to 31 (from 24) so
   appropriate. Likely first lab results inaccurate.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Now with embolic CVA. Patient does
   not want CT surgery so will not reconsult.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - f/u blood cx
   - f/u CT head/face FR for ?dental abscess
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Fluid goal even
   - Cards would consider valvuloplasty after completion of abx course but
   this may change given new CVA
   # Hypertension: Appears to be related to agitation (sedation decreased
   yesterday, BP increases when patient stimulated)
   - Permissive hypertension (goal 150-160) for CVA
   - D/c art line today.
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as
   chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx after foley change with fungus.
   Urine negative for eos.
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - cannot give contrast based on renal function.
   # Elevated LFTs: Bili and alk phos elevated today. ? increase hemolysis
   due to valve vs. biliary pathology.
   - repeat LFTs and RUQ U/S if continued elevation.
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to OSH with pneumonia. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty due to critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The patient has several medical complications and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). She is on mechanical ventilation and is being weaned off sedation as tolerated.

2. Embolic CVA: The patient has developed a stroke due to embolic infarction. Neurological recommendations are being followed, and an MRI follow-up is planned. Heparin therapy may be considered after the risk of bleeding has subsided.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has trended down over the course of a few days. Sources of anemia include bloody secretions, guaiac-positive stools, and hemolysis from valve vegetation. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with an appropriate bump in hemoglobin level.

4. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for Streptococcus salivarius, which is pansensitive. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) shows posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. The patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to OSH with pneumonia. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has been experiencing respiratory failure, embolic cerebrovascular accident (stroke), anemia, mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, hypertension, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia, and positive HIT antibodies.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's severe COPD and pneumonia may contribute to respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator will be challenging due to the combination of severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema, and hospital-acquired pneumonia.
2. Embolic CVA: The patient has experienced an embolic stroke, likely caused by septic emboli from mitral valve endocarditis. Further evaluation and management are needed to prevent future embolic events.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, possibly due to bloody secretions, guaiac-positive stools, and hemolysis from valve vegetation. Appropriate blood transfusions have been given, but close monitoring of hemoglobin levels is necessary.
4. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for pansensitive S. salivarius, and a trans-th"

   requiring mechanical ventilation include resolving pneumonia (off abx),
   AS/CHF, and COPD flare. Will continue low dose lasix gtt for volume
   removal and continue steroid taper. Follow up final face / neck CT for
   odontogenic infection.
   3.       For critical AS, plan has been valvuloplasty once stable and

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including endocarditis, respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and critical aortic stenosis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. 

The patient has a history of stroke, anemia, aortic stenosis, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, and hypokalemia. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 74 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 164/85 to 166/94 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support. 

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin levels, elevated platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal electrolyte levels including hypokalemia and hypernatremia. 

Her assessment and plan include several conditions: embolic cerebrovascular accident, respiratory failure, critical aortic stenosis, anemia, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, and hypokalemia. 

The treatment plan includes continuing penicillin via percutaneous central catheter (PICC) line for six weeks, discussing the need for surgery with the family, continuing"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill woman with multiple medical conditions, including endocarditis, respiratory failure, congestive heart failure (CHF), and critical aortic stenosis (AS). She has a history of stroke, anemia, aortic stenosis, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, and hypokalemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has been on antibiotics but has shown embolic cerebral vascular accident (CVA) and ongoing issues with critical AS. The patient's kidney function is stable, but she has hypernatremia and rising total bilirubin levels. There are concerns about potential complications such as hemolysis, acute cholecystitis, and hepatic dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic CVA: The patient's refusal of surgery in the past, along with her known endocarditis, increases the risk of embolic CVA. Continuing penicillin via percutaneous central catheter (PICC) for a 6-week course is recommended.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's transition from ventilation-assisted care (VAC) to pressure support ventilation (PSV) has major issues requiring mechanical ventilation. These include resolving pneumonia (off antibiotics), AS/CHF, and COPD flare. Low-dose lasix gtt will be continued for volume removal, and the"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
    # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atalectasis, hemorrhage, edema and  HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - I/O goal: even off lasix gtt
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Cont PS at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (D [**1-1**] of 30mg)
   - Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/24hr (D2)
   - Wean valium 5mg q8h (D1 = [**5-16**]) to q12h
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis
   - Appreciate Neuro recs
   - Not on heparin currently given persistent oozing post-trach and new
   CVA. D/W neuro best time to re-start hep gtt/coumadin.
   - LDL elevated but has transaminitis at baseline so statin not a good
   option for her. As CVA was embolic do not feel she would benefit from
   this therapy as CVA prevention but with DM may consider adding
   different class of cholesterol lowering medication in the future.
   - CT surgery to evaluate today
   - Consider repeat TTE to evaluate vegetation progression
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis
 Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Now with embolic CVA. Patient does
   not want CT surgery so will not reconsult.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u CT head/face FR for ?dental abscess
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.
   - Fluid goal even
   - Cards would consider valvuloplasty after completion of abx course but
   this may change given new CVA
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down over course of last couple of
   days.  Sources include continued bloody secretions, guaiaic positive
   stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable today
   - Trend hcts daily
   # Hypertension: Appears to be related to agitation (sedation decreased
   yesterday, BP increases when patient stimulated)
   - Permissive hypertension (goal 150-160) for CVA
   - A-line discontinued [**5-18**]
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) as well as
   chronic renal dysfunction. Repeat Ucx after foley change with fungus.
   Urine negative for eos.
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Cannot give contrast based on renal function.
   # Elevated LFTs: Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly
   improved today. ?increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary
   pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis
   or cholelithiasis. Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.
   - Trend  LFTs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and mitral valve endocarditis. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and underwent valvuloplasty due to critical AS. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, embolic CVA, mitral valve endocarditis, anemia, hypertension, ARF, and elevated LFTs. She also has thrombocytopenia with positive HIT Ab.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and pneumonia contribute to respiratory failure. Continued care is needed to manage her respiratory support and wean off mechanical ventilation as tolerated.
2. Embolic CVA: The patient has had an embolic stroke, likely caused by the mitral valve endocarditis. Monitoring neurologic status and considering restart of heparin therapy after addressing bleeding issues.
3. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for S. salivarius, indicating ongoing infection. Antibiotic treatment should be continued as per ID recommendations.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been trending down, possibly due to bloody secretions, guaiac positive stools, and hemolysis from valve vegetation. Daily trend of Hct levels is recommended.
5. Hypertension: The patient's high blood pressure may be related to agitation. Permissive hypertension goals should be set at 150"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis
   - F/u Neuro recs
   - CT surgery to evaluate today per family request
   - Paramount is family discussion re: goals of care; will await CT
   surgery input re: whether surgery even possibility
   - Consider repeat TTE to evaluate vegetation progression depending on
   goals of care
   - LDL elevated but has transaminitis at baseline so statin not a good
   option for her. As CVA was embolic do not feel she would benefit from
   this therapy as CVA prevention but with DM may consider adding
   different class of cholesterol lowering medication in the future.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Now with embolic CVA. Patient does
   not want CT surgery so will not reconsult.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Follow daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u CT head/face read for ?dental abscess
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope. Had diuresed well on
   lasix gtt but almost 2L positive yesterday off gtt
   - Low-dose Lasix (10mg IV) with I/O goal net even for day
   - Cards to reconsider valvuloplasty after completion of abx course
   although this may change given new CVA
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - Lasix prn for I/O goal net even as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Cont PS at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated; will monitor via VBG and
   O2 sats as a-line now out
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (D [**1-1**] of 30mg)
   - Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/24hr (D2)
   - Wean valium 5mg q8h (D1 = [**5-16**]) to q12h
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down over course of last couple of
   days but stable today s/p blood transfusions yesterday AM.  Possible
   sources include continued bloody secretions, guaiaic positive stools,
   hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # Hypertension: Stably elevated but plan for permissive hypertension
   (goal 150-160) for CVA
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Cannot give contrast based on renal function, limiting utility of CT
   abd
   - Will rediscuss imaging with ID after goals of care discussion with
   family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
   Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to OSH with pneumonia. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS, but found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has had multiple complications including embolic CVA, respiratory failure, anemia, hypertension, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic CVA: The patient had an embolic stroke likely due to endocarditis. This could lead to neurological deficits and potential further strokes.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and developed respiratory failure, which may require continued ventilatory support.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has trended down, indicating a possible ongoing bleeding or hemolysis from valve vegetation. This could result in fatigue, weakness, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is stably elevated, and permissive hypertension is being planned for CVA management. High blood pressure may increase the risk of further end-organ damage.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has worsening renal function with an increase in creatinine levels. This may progress to chronic renal failure, requiring dialysis or renal replacement therapy.
6. Elevated Liver Function Tests: The patient has elevated bilir"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis
   - F/u Neuro recs
   - CT surgery to evaluate today per family request
   - Paramount is family discussion re: goals of care; will await CT
   surgery input re: whether surgery even possibility
   - Consider repeat TTE to evaluate vegetation progression depending on
   goals of care
   - LDL elevated but has transaminitis at baseline so statin not a good
   option for her. As CVA was embolic do not feel she would benefit from
   this therapy as CVA prevention but with DM may consider adding
   different class of cholesterol lowering medication in the future.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Now with embolic CVA. Patient does
   not want CT surgery so will not reconsult.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Follow daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - F/u blood cx
   - F/u CT head/face read for ?dental abscess
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope. Had diuresed well on
   lasix gtt but almost 2L positive yesterday off gtt
   - Low-dose Lasix (10mg IV) with I/O goal net even for day
   - Cards to reconsider valvuloplasty after completion of abx course
   although this may change given new CVA
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - Lasix prn for I/O goal net even as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Cont PS at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated; will monitor via VBG and
   O2 sats as a-line now out
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (D [**1-1**] of 30mg)
   - Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/24hr (D2)
   - Wean valium 5mg q8h (D1 = [**5-16**]) to q12h
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down over course of last couple of
   days but stable today s/p blood transfusions yesterday AM.  Possible
   sources include continued bloody secretions, guaiaic positive stools,
   hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # Hypertension: Stably elevated but plan for permissive hypertension
   (goal 150-160) for CVA
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Cannot give contrast based on renal function, limiting utility of CT
   abd
   - Will rediscuss imaging with ID after goals of care discussion with
   family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
   Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and later diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis. She has had multiple embolic strokes, one of which is recent. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she has elevated liver function tests and thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies show liver nodularity and gallbladder sludge without evidence of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis. The patient's family wants to pursue CT surgery evaluation for possible surgery, but the patient herself does not want this. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic CVA: The patient has already experienced multiple embolic strokes, and there is a risk of further embolic events due to the ongoing mitral valve endocarditis.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has pansensitive S. salivarius infection, and the presence of vegetation on the mitral valve increases the risk of embolic events and possible heart block.
3. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which may worsen over time and lead to symptoms such as angina or syncope.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has severe COPD and may experience exacerbations leading to respiratory failure, especially if weaning from mechanical ventilation"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to OSH with pneumonia. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS but found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, embolic CVA, anemia, mitral valve endocarditis, critical AS, hypertension, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's family initially wanted DNR and palliative care but later called back wanting CT surgery to evaluate her for surgery. The patient is currently receiving ICU care and has multiple medical complications that require careful management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing likely multifactorial respiratory failure with contributions from severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema, and healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP). Weaning from mechanical ventilation may be challenging due to underlying COPD and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Embolic CVA: The patient has had an embolic stroke, which can lead to neurological deficits and complications such as increased intracranial pressure, cerebral edema, and risk of recurrent embolic events.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending down, indicating anemia. Sources of anemia include continued bloody secretions, guaiac positive"

   - Imaging results are not provided in the given progress note.

9. Assessment and Plan:
   The patient has multiple medical issues including CVA, anemia, altered mental status, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, hypokalemia, and respiratory failure. The plan includes ongoing antibiotic therapy, mechanical ventilation, discussion about surgical options, management of hypertension, and treatment for other complications.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the given information include:
- Embolic CVA: The patient has a history of endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic strokes. It is mentioned that the patient may not be a candidate for surgery due to previous refusal.
- Respiratory failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, possibly due to pneumonia, AS/CHF, and COPD flare. Mechanical ventilation is ongoing.
- Critical aortic stenosis: The patient is planned for valvuloplasty once stable and off antibiotics. However, the presence of embolic CVA may prevent this surgery.
- Acute renal failure: The patient's creatinine levels are elevated, indicating possible renal impairment.
- Decubitus ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which may worsen during prolonged bed rest.
- Hypertension: The patient has high blood pressure that needs to be managed.
- Hypokalemia: The patient has low potassium levels, which require correction.
- Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided information, and there may be additional medical complications or details not mentioned in the progress note."

","The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a chief complaint of endocarditis and CVA (cerebral infarction). She has a history of aortic stenosis and has refused surgery in the past. The patient is currently in the ICU with several medical complications. 

Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.8 F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 155/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a Vt set at 380 mL, PS of 8 cmH2O, RR set at 14, PEEP of 8 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and SpO2 of 100%.

Her physical examination reveals a 3/6 aortic systolic murmur and fair air movement in the chest. Neurological examination shows PERRL (pupils equally round and reactive to light) and reactive. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.9 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.4 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 132 K/uL, and elevated lactate levels at 1.3 mmol/L. Other lab results include elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, slightly elevated potassium, and low magnesium levels. 

The patient has multiple medical complications including CVA (stroke), anemia, endocarditis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, hypokalemia, and respiratory failure. 

The plan of care includes continuing penicillin via percutaneous central catheter (PICC) for six weeks due to known endocarditis. The patient's refusal for surgery in the past may impact further treatment options. 

For respiratory failure, the patient will continue low-dose lasix for volume removal and steroid taper. A follow-up final face/neck CT is planned for an odontogenic infection.

Valvuloplasty is planned for critical aortic stenosis once the patient is stable and off antibiotics. However, an embolic CVA may prevent this procedure from happening.

The patient's acute renal failure is stable, and she will continue on [street address] medications and be monitored closely while on lasix. Hypernatremia will be managed with free water by G-tube. 

The rising total bilirubin level should be differentiated and further investigations are planned after a family meeting. A repeat RUQ US will be done if aggressive care continues.

The patient has a DNR (do not resuscitate) code status."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a history of endocarditis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and other medical conditions such as aortic stenosis, anemia, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, hypokalemia, and respiratory failure. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include an EKG showing no acute changes, RUQ US showing gallbladder contraction with sludge and thickened walls, and the administration of antibiotics, insulin, and lansoprazole. The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 155/70 to 164/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,192 mL and output of 1,275 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 1,917 mL. She is receiving oxygen via an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 380 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) values are within normal limits"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a chronically ill woman with multiple medical complications. The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Embolic CVA (stroke): The patient has a history of endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic strokes. Due to her refusal of surgery in the past, there is a need to discuss and evaluate the possibility of surgical intervention, specifically aortic valve replacement and mitral valve repair, considering the patient's recent cerebral infarction.

2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and volume overload. The plan includes restarting low-dose lasix bolus versus gtt for volume removal, continuing steroid taper, and trying again with pressure support ventilation (PSV) in the morning.

3. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis may require valvuloplasty once she is stable and off antibiotics. However, the recent embolic CVA likely prevents this for now and may prevent it permanently.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is stable, and her current medications and close monitoring while on lasix will be continued.

5. Rising total bilirubin (T bili): The rising T bili may indicate hemolysis, acute cholecystitis, or other causes. Further"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis vs embolic or thrombotic ca
   - F/u Neuro recs
   - CT surgery to evaluate today per family request
   - Paramount is family discussion re: goals of care; will await CT
   surgery input re: whether surgery even possible
   - Consider repeat TTE to evaluate vegetation progression depending on
   goals of care
   - LDL elevated but has transaminitis at baseline so statin not a good
   option for her. As CVA was embolic do not feel she would benefit from
   this therapy as CVA prevention but with DM may consider adding
   different class of cholesterol lowering medication in the future.
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **], now with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Non-contrast CT of head/neck without
   obvious dental abscess.  Now with embolic CVA.  All bacterial and
   fungal blood cultures at this hospital without growth to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Follow daily ECGs to monitor for development of heart block
   - F/u blood cx
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope. Off lasix drip with
   one 10 mg lasix bolus yesterday with even fluid balance for the day.
   - Low-dose Lasix (10mg IV) with I/O goal net even for day
   - Hold off on further discussion of valvuloplasty pending family
   meeting to clarify goals
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - Lasix prn for I/O goal net even as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - PS trial at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated; will monitor via VBG and
   O2 sats
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (D [**1-1**] of 30mg)
   - Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/24hr, Valium at 5 mg PO q12hr
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down but bumped appropriately after 2
   u pRBC [**5-18**].  Possible sources include continued bloody secretions,
   guaiaic positive stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable
   today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # Hypertension: Stably elevated but plan for permissive hypertension
   (goal 150-160) for CVA
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - consider fluc for funguria
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Cannot give contrast based on renal function, limiting utility of CT
   abd
   - Will rediscuss imaging with ID after goals of care discussion with
   family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
   Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.
   - Trend LFTs
   # Thrombocytopenia: Increased plt since heparin held; HIT Ab positive.
   Likely  also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS. However, the patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the heart valve. This infection has led to an embolic cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and respiratory failure.

The patient's current medical conditions include critical aortic stenosis, mitral valve endocarditis, respiratory failure, anemia, hypertension, acute renal failure, elevated liver function tests, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's blood cultures were initially positive for Strep salivarius, but subsequent cultures have shown no growth.

The patient is receiving treatment for her conditions, including antibiotics for the endocarditis, Lasix for fluid balance, prednisone for COPD exacerbation, fentanyl patch for pain management, and Valium for sedation. The patient is also being monitored closely with daily ECGs to watch for development of heart block, and her blood cultures are being followed up regularly.

The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate), indicating that she does not want to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation if her heart stops or if she stops breathing. The patient's disposition is currently in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and subsequent hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The patient was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis, but was found to have mitral valve endocarditis.

The patient has multiple medical complications including embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), mitral valve endocarditis, critical aortic stenosis, respiratory failure, acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and thrombocytopenia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure due to severe COPD and atelectasis, further embolic events leading to additional CVAs, progression of mitral valve endocarditis with possible septic emboli or heart block, worsening of critical aortic stenosis potentially requiring urgent valvuloplasty, acute kidney injury due to ARF, development of bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia, and potential worsening of anemia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, neurologic function, renal function, blood counts, and liver enzymes. Frequent assessment of the patient's oxygen saturation, ventilation parameters, and fluid balance is crucial. In addition, regular imaging"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis (AS), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. The patient has been intubated and required mechanical ventilation due to hypoxic respiratory failure. She also has acute renal failure (ARF), anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver function tests (LFTs).

The potential medical complications that can arise based on this information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's severe COPD and pneumonia may contribute to ongoing respiratory failure. Weaning off mechanical ventilation might be challenging due to the presence of atelectasis, edema, and possible hemorrhage.

2. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for Streptococcus salivarius, indicating an infection of the mitral valve. This condition requires long-term antibiotic treatment and may require surgical intervention if the infection does not resolve.

3. Critical aortic stenosis (AS): The patient's AS is critical, which could potentially worsen over time. Valvuloplasty might be considered to improve the patient's functional status, but the decision depends on the family's goals of care and the patient's baseline functional status.

4. Embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA): The patient has experienced multiple bilateral acute infarcts in the supra- and intra-tentorial region"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old with a chief complaint of endocarditis and CVA. The patient has a history of aortic stenosis, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status (not delirium), alteration in nutrition, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer (present at admission), hypertension (benign), hypokalemia (low potassium, hypotassium), and respiratory failure (acute). The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 128/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation through a tracheostomy tube with a mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume of 380 mL, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 21 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and compliance of 38 cmH2O/mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.3-18.6 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL, platelet count of 82-102 thousand/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0-2.1 mg/dL, glucose level of 129-171 mg/dL, potassium level of 2.0-2.8 mEq/L, sodium level of 135-137 mEq/L, chloride level of 97-105 mEq/L, magnesium level of 2.0-2.5 mg/dL, phosphate level of 4.6-4.8 mg/dL, calcium level of 8.9-9.1 mg/dL, lactate level of 1.3 mmol/L, albumin level of 2.8 g/dL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 31.7 mg/dL. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results are as follows: pH 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2) 38 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) 106 mmHg, bicarbonate (HCO3-) 27 mEq/L, base excess (BE) -2 mEq/L, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) 100%.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Embolic CVA: The patient has a history of endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). The patient has refused surgery in the past,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a chief complaint of endocarditis and CVA (cerebrovascular accident). She has a history of aortic stenosis, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, and hypokalemia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on multiple medications including Penicillin G potassium, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Embolic CVA: The patient has a known endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic strokes. She has refused surgery in the past, but her condition may require further discussion with the family about potential surgical options.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or other causes. She is no longer able to perform pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is volume overloaded. The plan is to restart low-dose Lasix and continue steroid taper.
3. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient's critical aortic stenosis may require valvuloplasty once she is stable and off antibiotics. However, the recent embolic CVA may prevent this procedure.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's ARF is stable, and she is being closely monitored while on Lasix.

The patient is a chronically ill woman with a history of endocarditis, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), aortic stenosis, anemia, bacterial endocarditis, altered mental status, alteration in nutrition, coagulopathy, decubitus ulcer, hypertension, hypokalemia, and respiratory failure. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic CVA: The patient has a known history of endocarditis and has refused surgery in the past. There is a risk of another embolic CVA due to the ongoing endocarditis. The patient will continue to receive penicillin via PICC for six weeks. The family needs to be informed about the potential for rehabilitation and the possibility of discussing surgical options with Dr. [Doctor's First Name 458].

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient can no longer perform pressure support ventilation (PSV) due to the recent CVA and is experiencing volume overload. There is a concern for acute respiratory failure (ARF). The plan is to restart low-dose lasix boluses or continuous infusion for volume removal and continue steroid tapering. PSV will be attempted again in the morning.

3. Critical Aortic Stenosis: Valvuloplasty was initially planned once the patient was stable and off antibiotics. However, the recent embolic CVA likely prevents this procedure at the moment, and it may"

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator and underwent valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis. However, she was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has experienced multiple complications, including respiratory failure, embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), thrombocytopenia, Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and positive blood cultures for Strep salivarius.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has positive blood cultures for Strep salivarius and evidence of mitral valve leaflet endocarditis on transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This condition can lead to further embolic events, septic emboli to the brain or other organs, heart failure, or even rupture of the valve.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient has critical aortic stenosis, which can result in syncope, angina, and eventually heart failure if not managed properly. The patient may require further intervention, such as aortic valve replacement or repair, depending on her functional"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and recent admission to the hospital for pneumonia. She was transferred to the ICU due to difficulty weaning from the ventilator and for valvuloplasty for critical AS. Upon evaluation, she was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has experienced multiple embolic strokes and is now in respiratory failure. She has been positive for Clostridium difficile, and her platelet count has been decreasing. She also has anemia and acute renal failure. Her liver function tests are elevated, indicating possible hemolysis or biliary pathology. The patient's condition has not improved despite treatment, and the family has expressed a desire to transfer her to a rehabilitation facility with the possibility of transitioning to hospice care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, involving severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema, and hospital-acquired pneumonia. Continued monitoring and management are necessary.
2. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has confirmed mitral valve endocarditis, which can lead to further embolic events and systemic infection. Ongoing antibiotic therapy is required.
3. Embolic Cerebrovascular Accidents (CVAs): The patient has already experienced multiple embolic strokes due to the endocarditis. This risk may persist if the"

   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis  (less likely embolic or
   thrombotic).  MRI head revealed
multiple bilateral acute infarcts in
   the supra- and intra-tentorial region
, likely embolic given widespread
   distribution.
   - No intervention on valve per CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue PCN course
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Non-contrast CT of head/neck without
   obvious dental abscess.  Now with embolic CVA.  All bacterial and
   fungal blood cultures at this hospital without growth to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Stop daily ECGs (normal PR interval for >10 days)
   - F/u blood cx
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope.  Up 3 L for
   length-of-stay.
   - Low-dose Lasix gtt with I/O goal net even-to-minus 500 cc today.
   - No role for valvuloplasty at this time until acute vegetation
   resolved
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn.  Has tolerated PS for 24 hours.
   - Lasix gtt at 1.0-1.5 for I/O goal as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Continue PS today; will monitor via VBG and O2 sats
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (today is day [**1-29**] at
   20mg), decrease to 10mg tomorrow
   - Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/72hr, Valium at 5 mg PO q12hr
   # C diff positive: Started vanc [**2176-5-20**]
   - Clarify course (? continue course to end 7 days after Pen G ([**2182-6-18**])
   )
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreasing again (101 -> 72 over 48 hours
   after) initial increase once heparin held; HIT Ab positive.  Likely
   also [**12-31**] underlying liver disease and reactive component from
   infection.
   - F/u serotonin release assay
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down but bumped appropriately after 2
   u pRBC [**5-18**].  Possible sources include continued bloody secretions,
   guaiaic positive stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable
   today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - Per ID, tx of chronic funguria is ineffective
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Will rediscuss after goals of care discussion with family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, who was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and subsequently developed hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. She has also been diagnosed with mitral valve endocarditis, multiple embolic strokes, and acute renal failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several medical complications including thrombocytopenia, anemia, C. difficile infection, and elevated liver function tests.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:

1. Severe COPD exacerbation: The patient has a history of severe COPD, which can be exacerbated by factors such as respiratory infections, airway obstruction, or inadequate treatment.

2. Valve-related complications: Given the presence of mitral valve endocarditis, there is a risk of further valve damage, embolic events, or systemic infection spread.

3. Renal dysfunction: The patient has acute renal failure, and there is a possibility of worsening renal function due to ongoing infections, fluid imbalances, or medication-related nephrotoxicity.

4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count is decreasing, which may indicate ongoing platelet consumption or destruction. This could lead to increased bleeding risks, especially considering the patient's current intubation status.

5. Anemia: The patient has a declining hemoglobin level, which may be due to ongoing blood loss, hemolysis"

   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis  (less likely embolic or
   thrombotic).  MRI head revealed
multiple bilateral acute infarcts in
   the supra- and intra-tentorial region
, likely embolic given widespread
   distribution.
   - F/u Neuro recs
   - CT surgery to evaluate today per family request
   - Paramount is family discussion re: goals of care; will await CT
   surgery attending input re: whether surgery even possible
   - Consider repeat TTE to evaluate vegetation progression depending on
   goals of care
   .
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Non-contrast CT of head/neck without
   obvious dental abscess.  Now with embolic CVA.  All bacterial and
   fungal blood cultures at this hospital without growth to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Stop daily ECGs
   - F/u blood cx
   - send off c diff.
   # AS: Critical AS on TTE. Unclear what her baseline functional status
   is, she does not have regular angina, or syncope. Off lasix drip with
   one 10 mg lasix bolus yesterday with even fluid balance for the day
   after transient decrease in SBP (100
s) that responded to gentle fluid
   bolus.
   - Low-dose Lasix gtt with I/O goal net even for day (dropped pressures
   to 10 mg IV lasix bolus).
   - Hold off on further discussion of valvuloplasty pending family
   meeting to clarify goals
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn
   - Lasix gtt at 1.0-1.5 for I/O goal net even as above
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - PS trial at 8/8 today and wean as tolerated; will monitor via VBG and
   O2 sats
   - F/u pending cx
   - Continue prednisone taper for COPD exacerbation (D [**1-1**] of 30mg)
   - Fentanyl patch 25 mcg/24hr, Valium at 5 mg PO q12hr
   # C diff positive: Started flagyl [**2176-5-20**]
   - Continue course to end 7 days after Pen G ([**2182-6-18**])
   # Anemia: Hct had slowly trended down but bumped appropriately after 2
   u pRBC [**5-18**].  Possible sources include continued bloody secretions,
   guaiaic positive stools, hemolysis from valve vegetation.  Hct stable
   today.
   - Trend hcts daily
   # ARF: No known h/o renal dysfunction. Cr 1.2 at OSH now stable at
   around 2 daily. Abd U/S here did not report hydronephrosis but did have
   urothelial thickening suggesting chronic UTI (?fungal) with Ucx
   persistently growing yeast despite foley changes. U/S also suggestive
   of chronic renal dysfunction. Urine negative for eos.
   - Per ID, tx of chronic funguria is ineffective
   - MR abd not indicated per radiology
   - Will rediscuss after goals of care discussion with family
   # Elevated LFTs: H/o autoimmune hepatitis with baseline LFTs unknown.
   Bili and alk phos elevated yesterday, slightly improved today.
   ?Increase hemolysis due to endocarditis vs. biliary pathology. [**Month (only) 60**] be
   due to gallbladder sludge; no signs of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis.
   Subtle liver nodularity with nl hepatic flow.

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and admitted to the hospital with pneumonia. She has been intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and ARF. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical AS, but was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has multiple bilateral acute infarcts in the supra- and intra-tentorial region, likely embolic given the widespread distribution. She also has anemia, ARF, positive C. diff, elevated LFTs, thrombocytopenia, and a positive HIT Ab. The patient's family wants her to go to rehab with a possible transition to hospice care. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic strokes: The patient has had multiple bilateral acute infarcts in the brain, indicating possible embolic strokes. This could be due to the mitral valve endocarditis.
2. Mitral valve endocarditis: The patient has pansensitive S. salivarius in her blood cultures, along with positive TTE showing posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. This condition needs to be treated appropriately.
3. Anemia: The patient's Hct has been slowly trending down, possibly due to continued bloody secretions, guaiac positive stools, or hemolysis from valve vegetation.
4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   75F with h/o severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, admitted to OSH with
   pneumonia, complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure requiring
   intubation, ARF, transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty
   for critical AS and found to have mitral valve endocarditis.
   # Embolic CVA: Likely [**12-31**] endocarditis  (less likely embolic or
   thrombotic).  MRI head revealed
multiple bilateral acute infarcts in
   the supra- and intra-tentorial region
, likely embolic given widespread
   distribution.
   - No intervention on valve per CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
   - Continue PCN course
   # Mitral Valve Endocarditis: Blood cultures positive on day 2 of
   hospital stay at [**Hospital1 **] with pansensitive S. salivarius. TTE shows
   posterior MV leaflet endocarditis. Non-contrast CT of head/neck without
   obvious dental abscess.  Now with embolic CVA.  All bacterial and
   fungal blood cultures at this hospital without growth to date.
   - Continue PCN for Strep salivarius (6 week course started on [**4-30**]) per
   ID recs
   - Stop daily ECGs (normal PR interval for >10 days)
   - F/u blood cx

   - Low-dose Lasix gtt with I/O goal net even-to-minus 500 cc today.
   - No role for valvuloplasty at this time until acute vegetation
   resolved.  Follow up with cardiology to get final recs about
   valvuloplasty.
   # Respiratory failure: Likely multifactorial with contributions from
   severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema and HAP s/p full course of
   vanc/zosyn.  Has tolerated PS for 24 hours.
   - Decrease free water flushes to minimize intake.
   - Continue PS today; will monitor via VBG and O2 sats

   - Fentanyl patch 50 mcg/72hr, taper Valium to 5 mg PO q24hr starting
   tomorrow
   # C diff positive: Started vanc [**2176-5-20**]
   - Clarify course (? continue course to end 7 days after Pen G ([**2182-6-18**])
   )
   # Thrombocytopenia: Platelets decreasing again (101 -> 72 over 48 hours

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure and endocarditis. The patient has a history of severe aortic stenosis, severe COPD, and was admitted with pneumonia. They were intubated due to hypoxic respiratory failure and also had acute renal failure. 

The patient was found to have mitral valve endocarditis, with blood cultures positive for S. salivarius. The non-contrast CT of the head/neck did not reveal any obvious dental abscess. The patient has experienced multiple embolic cerebral vascular accidents (CVAs), likely due to the endocarditis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 73 bpm, blood pressure of 125/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 380 mL and peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated creatinine levels, hyperglycemia, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient has a positive result for C. difficile and asymptomatic funguria. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure, requiring intubation. She was transferred for difficulty weaning and valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis but was found to have mitral valve endocarditis. The patient has had multiple embolic cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs), likely due to endocarditis. She also has anemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), elevated liver enzymes, and thrombocytopenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Mitral Valve Endocarditis: The patient has pansensitive S. salivarius, which is causing mitral valve endocarditis. This condition can lead to further embolic events, septic emboli, and potentially worsening heart failure.

2. Critical Aortic Stenosis: The patient's aortic stenosis is critical and may lead to symptoms such as angina, syncope, and heart failure. If not managed properly, it can result in sudden cardiac death.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely multifactorial, including severe COPD, atelectasis, hemorrhage, edema, and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Improper management can lead to worsening hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a chief complaint of altered mental status and respiratory failure. She has a history of aortic stenosis, bacterial endocarditis, and previous strokes. The patient's condition has been complicated by several medical complications, including C. difficile infection, yeast in urine, HIT positivity, and thrombocytopenia.

Vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (96.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 125/79 to 155/85 mmHg, heart rate between 62-84 bpm, respiratory rate around 13-26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 380 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 23 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.27.

The patient's physical examination reveals dry mucous membranes, regular rhythm with a slightly elevated systolic murmur, clear lung sounds bilaterally, soft and non-tender abdomen, warm and well-perfused extremities, and neurologic exam showing strength in the left upper and lower extremities but weakness in the right upper extremity.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.3 K/uL, elevated creatinine"

   1.       Embolic CVA: in setting of known endocarditis, had refused
   surgery in past. Continue PCN via PICC for 6w course. Need to discuss
   this issue with family as hope been for rehab soon- may still be able
   to go but goals may evolve. They would like t o hear reccs from CT [**Doctor First Name 458**]
 however since she had been clear about not wanting another surgery in
   past we will need to have a full discussion. Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 5648**] to see pt today
   to evaluate if she were even a candidate. Question are would she need
   AVR and MVR and with CVA could she tolerate acoag for bypass (this is
   aside from issue of whether she would even agree)
   2.       Resp Failure: no longer able to do PSV - ? combo since CVA and
   also getting a bit volume overloaded. AS/CHF, and COPD flare. Will
   restart low dose lasix. gtt for volume removal and continue steroid
   taper. Try again PSV 8-12/8 again today
   3.       For critical AS, plan has been valvuloplasty once stable and
   off abx. But embolkc CVA likely prevents this for now and maybe ever
   4.    ARF is stable, [**Street Address(1) 9332**] meds and monitor closely while on

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill woman with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, endocarditis, heart failure, stroke, anemia, aortic stenosis, coagulopathy, malnutrition, and hypertension. She has a history of known endocarditis and has developed an embolic cerebrovascular accident (stroke). The patient is not a surgical candidate for valvuloplasty due to severe aortic stenosis. She is currently on penicillin and metronidazole for endocarditis treatment. The patient also has Clostridium difficile infection, which is being treated with vancomycin. Acute renal failure is stable, and the patient will continue with [**Street Address(1) 9332**] medications and close monitoring while on Lasix. The patient's total bilirubin level is falling, but further evaluation is needed to rule out hemolysis or other causes. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and she will be transferred to a rehabilitation or long-term care facility.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Endocarditis with embolic CVA: The patient has known endocarditis, which increases the risk of embolic strokes. The presence of an embolic CVA prevents the patient from undergoing valvuloplasty, potentially leading to long-term complications related to endocarditis.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires prolonged ventilatory support due to respiratory failure,"
