","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicating a probable heart attack. The patient was initially intubated due to respiratory distress and low oxygen saturation on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). There have been multiple attempts to extubate the patient, with the most recent successful extubation followed by self-extubation. The patient is currently intubated again. Various interventions have been performed, including the placement of an arterial line, central venous catheter, and multi-lumen catheter for increased access and monitoring. Imaging and laboratory tests are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's initial presentation with tachypnea and low oxygen saturation suggests respiratory distress. The need for intubation and mechanical ventilation indicates a potential respiratory complication. Pulmonary edema and consolidation may be present due to the patient's history of congestive heart failure (CHF).

2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis, CHF, and previous CABG, there is a high likelihood of cardiac complications. Ischemia in major epicardial vessels and possible acute myocardial infarction (MI) have been suspected based on ECG changes and elevated troponin levels"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure, and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, suggesting probable congestive heart failure. The patient also has a history of multiple stents.

The patient's condition required intubation and mechanical ventilation due to tachycardia, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). He self-extubated and was subsequently re-intubated. An arterial line and central venous catheter were placed for increased access and to monitor cardiac output via the Fick equation.

The patient has multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, gout, and renal failure, which need to be managed during his ICU stay. He is receiving various medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, heparin, and morphine for sedation.

The assessment and plan indicate that the patient may have had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with concerns for ischemia in a major epicardial vessel. The patient's coronary arteries were assessed via catheterization, and no new coronary artery disease was found. The patient's condition is complicated by acute systolic congestive heart failure, and diuresis will be initiated. The possibility of pneumonia is also being"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, suggesting a probable CHF exacerbation. The patient was initially tachycardic, tachypneic, and had low oxygen saturation on bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP). The patient required intubation due to respiratory distress. After extubation, the patient self-extubated and had to be re-intubated. An arterial line and TLC catheter were placed for increased access and monitoring of cardiac output via the Fick equation. The patient has been receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, sedatives, and cardiac medications. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated and follows simple commands. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin levels, lactic acid levels, and liver enzymes. Imaging shows diffuse pulmonary edema, possible consolidation, and cardiomegaly. The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, previous CABG, and aortic stenosis. The assessment plan includes further evaluation for acute myocardial infarction,"

   CCU ATTENDING PROGRESS NOTE
   I have reviewed the progress note history and physical examination on
   [**2107-2-12**] by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) 6718**] above.  I was present during the
   pertinent portions of the physical examination today.   I concur with
   the diagnostic evaluation and treatment plan outlined above.
   Approximately 50% allocated time involved coordination of care.
   MEDICAL DECISION MAKING.  This 82 year old man who is s/p CABG [**2087**],
   [**2096**], [**2103**] who has known aortic stenosis (AVR = 1.0-1.2 with and
   without dobutamine) was admitted with a NSTEMI.  Cardiac
   catheterization was performed and showed 3 vessel coronary artery
   disease with patent native vessel stents, patent LIMA to the LAD, minor
   irregularities of the SVG to the OMB1, and occlusion of the SVG-PDA
   (which was old). No PCI was performed and the NSTEMI has been
   attributed to watershed infarction.  This has resulted in an
   exacerbation of his acute systolic and diastolic left ventricular
   dysfunction.  We have diuresed approximately 1L and his chest X ray has
   improved over the past 24 hours.  He still has intermittent episodes of
   atrial fibrillation with hypotenstion and elevation of his pulmonary
   artery pressures.    We will initiate beta blocker and [**Last Name (un) 284**] for this
   congestive heart failure.
   ASSESSMENT:  3 Vessel Coronary Artery Disease

                               Acute systolic and diastolic dysfunction
   PLAN:                      Ginger diuresis to 500 cc negative today
                                 Implement beta blockers and [**Last Name (un) 284**] and

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. He presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicating a probable acute myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's condition has worsened, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

The patient's medical history includes multiple comorbidities such as diabetes, renal failure, gout, and gastrointestinal issues. He is currently receiving various medications including aspirin, Plavix, statins, morphine for sedation, and other cardiac medications.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation despite being on bipap. His chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Laboratory results indicate elevated cardiac enzymes, leukocytosis, and signs of renal dysfunction.

The patient's medical complications may include:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory failure and presence of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray suggest a potential development of ARDS.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient's prolonged intubation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP.
3. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI): The patient has multiple"

","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and three-vessel disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice. The patient presented with dyspnea, elevated troponin levels, and probable CHF. Initial echocardiogram showed no change from previous ones, although the ECG suggested ischemia in a major epicardial vessel. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of aortic stenosis and CHF, there is a high risk of further cardiac complications such as heart failure exacerbation, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest.
2. Pulmonary Complications: The patient's respiratory distress and pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray indicate a potential risk of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
3. Renal Failure: The patient may be at risk for renal failure due to pre-renal causes from poor forward flow and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
4. Infection: The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, which may suggest an ongoing infection. The coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) with vancomycin and cefepime is appropriate, but it should be narrowed if no further fever and if the primary cardiac"

   Assessment and Plan
   83 y/o M w/ Aortic Stenosis, CHF w/ EF 45% and 3VD s/p CABGx2 and
   multiple stents p/w dyspnea and elevated troponin and probable CHF.
   .
   # CORONARIES: Reportedly NSTEMI by OSH.  ECG here concerning for
   ischemia in major epicardial vessel, ?LIMA to LAD vs. stents of left
   main or circ with intact LIMA.  Apparently echo unchanged from previous
   however.
   - ASA 325
   - Plavix 75 (already taking so no need to load)
   - High dose statin
   - Heparin gtt
   - Integrillin - will hold for now given increased risk of bleeding and
   limited benefit, but would initiate at time of procedure.
   - morphine for sedation
   - Caution with nitro given aortic stenosis with valve area 0.6
   - hold imdur/ranolazine
   - trend CE's to peak
   - PCI today
   # PUMP:  Failure.  Lasix gtt on hold until cath results returned.
   Await cath results.
   - check mixed venous O2 sat for cardiac output estimate
   - will hold lasix now that he is intubated until cath, likely resume
   Lasix gtt after for extubation
   - hold benicar, amlodipine, hydral, imdur
   - nitro gtt prn for hypertension.
   - echo today
   # RHYTHM: Appears sinus with LBBB, and tachycardia.
   - correct heart failure.
   - hold beta-blocker given pulmonary edema/CHF.
   # Valves: Critical AS.  Consider valvuloplasty.
   # Respiratory status: Most likely pulmonary edema [**1-25**] acute MI.  Given
   fevers to 101 and leukocytosis on presentation and inability to
   evaluate for pneumonia on chest x-ray will cover for HCAP with
   vanco/cefepime.  Narrow at 48 hours if no further fever and cardiac w/u
   reveals primary cardiac event (by far most likely).
   - Bolus lasix given, lasix gtt on hold pending cath
   - Nitro with caution for HTN or chest pain, but at goal BP now
   - CIS
   - BCx, sputum cultures
   # Renal Failure: Likely pre-renal from poor forward flow.
   - Urinalysis, urine lytes.
   - Mucomyst pre-cath
   - trend creatinine
   # Diabetes: hold metformin as going for cath.
   - HISS
   # GI: Famotidine while NPO.  On protonix at home.  Likely safe but opt
   for H2 blocker in acute setting given potential for interaction of
   plavix with PPI.
   # Gout: renally dose allopurinol.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and three-vessel disease who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and had multiple stents placed. He presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicating probable CHF.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes, gout, and renal failure, for which he is taking various medications such as ASA, Plavix, statins, morphine, and others. However, certain medications like integrillin and beta-blockers are being held due to the patient's increased risk of bleeding and pulmonary edema/CHF.

The patient's current condition is critical, with signs of heart failure and pulmonary edema. He is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin T, lactate, and lactic acid, suggesting an ongoing infection and ischemic process. Imaging reveals cardiomegaly with pulmonary edema and bilateral pleural effusions.

The patient has multiple lines and tubes in place, including arterial lines, central venous catheters, and a pulmonary"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, and three vessel disease (3VD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and placement of multiple stents. The patient presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicating a probable acute myocardial infarction (MI). 

The patient's condition has been complicated by respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema and acute MI. Antibiotics were initially started for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), but then discontinued due to lack of consolidation on X-ray. 

The patient also has acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure, as evidenced by elevated pulmonary artery (PA) pressures and low mixed venous oxygen saturation (MvO2) during episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib). 

Additionally, the patient has evidence of demand ischemia, as indicated by troponin leak at an outside hospital and concerns for ischemia in major epicardial vessels on electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's critical aortic stenosis is not intervenable, with a valve area of 1.2 cm. 

Furthermore, the patient has acute-on-chronic renal failure, likely pre-renal due to poor forward flow. 

The patient has a history of diabetes,"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure (CHF), and previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications that require close monitoring and management. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated due to acute respiratory failure, likely secondary to pulmonary edema or acute myocardial infarction (MI). There is a concern for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP) as evidenced by fevers and leukocytosis. Appropriate antibiotics should be administered, and the patient's secretions should be managed to prevent further complications.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is significantly reduced, indicating impaired cardiac function. Cardiogenic shock may be present given the elevated pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PCWP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Fluid management should be carefully monitored, and vasodilators should be held to optimize cardiac output.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (Afib): The patient experienced two episodes of Afib within the last 24 hours, leading to increased wedge and pulmonary artery pressures. It is important to"

   - manage fluid status delicately
   # Respiratory Failure:
   Most likely pulmonary edema [**1-25**] acute MI.  Given fevers to 101 and
   leukocytosis on presentation and inability to evaluate for pneumonia on
   chest x-ray will cover for HCAP with vanco/cefepime.  Narrow at 48
   hours if no further fever and cardiac w/u reveals primary cardiac event

","The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicative of probable CHF. The patient underwent two coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) and placement of multiple stents.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Acute on chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's PA catheter was removed yesterday due to a partially dislodged tip, but the elevated pressures indicate ongoing cardiac dysfunction.
2. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced two episodes of atrial fibrillation in the last 24 hours, resulting in increased wedge and pulmonary artery pressures temporarily. There is no PA catheter in place at the moment.
3. Demand ischemia: The patient has troponin leakage at an outside hospital, and the ECG shows signs of ischemia in a major epicardial vessel. It is being considered to perform a left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to the left anterior descending (LAD) artery or stenting of the left main coronary artery, depending on the condition of the LIMA.
4. Critical aortic stenosis: The patient has a valve area of 1.2 cm, which is not suitable for intervention. Fluid status needs to be managed carefully.
5. Respiratory failure: The patient likely has pulmonary edema"

   Imaging: Ccath
   1. Selective coronary angiography revealed three vessel CAD.  The LMCA
   had widely patent stents.  The LAD had an ostial occlusion, the first
   diagonal filled by the patent LIMA, with retrograde filling to the the
   remainder of the LAD with moderate diffuse disease (unchanged from last
   catheterization in 8/[**2105**]).  THe LCX had patent proximal stents,
   occluded OMs (unchanged), the first OM filled by the patent SVG.  The
   RCA was not injected as it was known to be occluded, and seen to fill
   via collaterals from LCX and LAD.
   2. Resting hemodynamics as well as dobutamine trial hemodynamics were
   performed for full evaluation of aortic stenosis in setting of low
   cardiac output at baseline.  The resting hemodynamics demonstrated
   elevated right filling pressures (RA 17/16), pulmonary hypertension (PA
   42/36/35), elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 34), and low
   cardiac index (1.96 l/min/m2).  At baseline the aortic valve area was
   calculated at 1.0 cm2 using a pressure gradient of 21 mm Hg.  After
   administering dobutamine, the hemodynamics improved with increased
   arterial pressure from radial line (117/53 up from baseline 102/61),
   improved cardiac index (2.67 l/min/m2).  The filling pressures were
   unchanged from baseline.
   3. The aortic valve was calculated to be 1.0 cm2 at rest, and given low
   cardiac output dobutamine challenge was performed for better evaluation
   of severity of aortic stenosis.  After dobutamine the aortic valve area
   calculation remained nearly unchanged at 1.1 cm2.
   4. Arterial conduit angiography revealed patent LIMA to LAD without
   subclavian to aortic pressure gradient.
   5. Venous angiography revealed SVG at descending aorta, marked by the
   lower of two graft ring markers, which was patent to obtuse marginal
   artery.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease, with no change in status as
   compared to [**7-/2106**] catheterization.  Patent LIMA and SVG-OM.
   2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
   3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

   respiratory failure, shock
","Summary:
The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and coronary artery disease (CAD). He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and has multiple stents. The patient presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, suggesting acute myocardial infarction (MI) and probable CHF. He is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, acute on chronic systolic heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, demand ischemia, critical aortic stenosis, and acute on chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely due to pulmonary edema or acute MI. He has thick secretions and mucus plugging, indicating a need for intervention.
2. Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure: The patient's heart failure is worsening, as indicated by elevated wedge pressure and pulmonary artery pressures. Cardiogenic shock may be present, necessitating careful fluid management.
3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had two episodes of atrial fibrillation in the last 24 hours, which can increase wedge and PA pressures temporarily. Close monitoring of heart rate and rhythm is essential.
4. Demand Ischemia: Troponin leak suggests ongoing myocardial ischemia. The patient's LIMA to LAD may be compromised, and further"

   Imaging: Ccath
   1. Selective coronary angiography revealed three vessel CAD.  The LMCA
   had widely patent stents.  The LAD had an ostial occlusion, the first
   diagonal filled by the patent LIMA, with retrograde filling to the the
   remainder of the LAD with moderate diffuse disease (unchanged from last
   catheterization in 8/[**2105**]).  THe LCX had patent proximal stents,
   occluded OMs (unchanged), the first OM filled by the patent SVG.  The
   RCA was not injected as it was known to be occluded, and seen to fill
   via collaterals from LCX and LAD.
   2. Resting hemodynamics as well as dobutamine trial hemodynamics were
   performed for full evaluation of aortic stenosis in setting of low
   cardiac output at baseline.  The resting hemodynamics demonstrated
   elevated right filling pressures (RA 17/16), pulmonary hypertension (PA
   42/36/35), elevated left sided filling pressures (PCWP 34), and low
   cardiac index (1.96 l/min/m2).  At baseline the aortic valve area was
   calculated at 1.0 cm2 using a pressure gradient of 21 mm Hg.  After
   administering dobutamine, the hemodynamics improved with increased
   arterial pressure from radial line (117/53 up from baseline 102/61),
   improved cardiac index (2.67 l/min/m2).  The filling pressures were
   unchanged from baseline.
   3. The aortic valve was calculated to be 1.0 cm2 at rest, and given low
   cardiac output dobutamine challenge was performed for better evaluation
   of severity of aortic stenosis.  After dobutamine the aortic valve area
   calculation remained nearly unchanged at 1.1 cm2.
   4. Arterial conduit angiography revealed patent LIMA to LAD without
   subclavian to aortic pressure gradient.
   5. Venous angiography revealed SVG at descending aorta, marked by the
   lower of two graft ring markers, which was patent to obtuse marginal
   artery.
   FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
   1. Three vessel coronary artery disease, with no change in status as
   compared to [**7-/2106**] catheterization.  Patent LIMA and SVG-OM.
   2. Moderate aortic stenosis.
   3. Severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 45%, and three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient has undergone two coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries and has multiple stents.

The patient presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, suggesting a probable acute myocardial infarction (MI) and congestive heart failure. The patient was initially given vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP), but antibiotics were discontinued yesterday due to no obvious consolidation on the chest X-ray.

The patient's respiratory status has been deteriorating, with thick secretions and mucus plugging. The patient's blood cultures, sputum cultures, and bronchoscopy cultures are pending. The antibiotics have been restarted.

The patient's cardiac status is complicated by severe diastolic ventricular dysfunction, moderate aortic stenosis, and three-vessel CAD. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which revealed patent left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to left anterior descending artery (LAD) and saphenous vein graft (SVG) to obtuse marginal artery. However, the patient's aortic valve area remained unchanged at 1.0 cm2 even after administering dobutamine"

   # Respiratory Failure:
   Extubated successfully but appears to have flashed into pulmonary edema
   overnight.  Given fevers to 101 and leukocytosis on presentation,
   started HCAP coverage with vanco/cefepime though no obvious
   consolidation on Xray. Antibiotics were DCed briefly, but pt became
   febrile by next AM, so antibiotics were restarted.  Patient with thick
   secretions still, appeared to have mucus plugged previously.  WBC
   increased today.  Was started on nitro gtt and lasix gtt early morning.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - continue lasix gtt in setting of pulmonary edema
   - wean off nitro drip to give him increased BP, more forward flow to
   kidneys in order to put out more urine
   - CIS, f/u BCx, sputum cultures
   - switch albuterol back to ipratropium nebs now that patient is
   extubated ; avoiding beta agonists b/c pt can become unstable w afib w
   RVR
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure.
   PA Cath DCed noted to have had elevated PCWP.  MvO2s low on
   presenation, but SVR high, likely cardiogenic shock.  Appears to have
   flashed into pulmonary edema last night.
   - continue to diurese w lasix gtt
   - hold benicar, amlodipine, hydral, imdur
   # Hypernatremia.
   2L free water deficit.  Got 500cc via NG tube + 200 D5W bolus.
   - getting free water flushes, can increase free water flushes
   accordingly
   # Paroxysmal Afib
   Had two episodes Afib in last 24hours, wedge and PA pressures increased
   temporarily during episode of Afib noted the day after admission; no PA
   catheter in anymore.  Had been taking metoprolol 37.5mg TID
   - decc metoprolol back to 25mg TID to help BPs to help diurese
   # Leukocytosis:
   Sudden increase in WBC, likely stress reaction.  On antibiotics
   currently for presumed pneumonia.
   # Demand Ischemia.
   Troponin leak at outside hospital.  ECG here concerning for ischemia in
   major epicardial vessel, ?LIMA to LAD vs. stents of LMCA or LCx with
   intact LIMA.  Apparently echo unchanged from previous however.
   - ASA 325, Plavix 75, High dose statin
   - morphine for sedation
   - hold imdur/ranolazine
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis.
   Not intervenable as seen on Cath.  Valve area 1.2, not changed with
   dobutamine.
   - manage fluid status delicately
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:
   Stable, improved from admission.  Likely pre-renal from poor forward
   flow.
   - follow
   # Diabetes: hold metformin as going for cath.
   - HISS
   # GI: Famotidine while NPO.  On protonix at home.  Likely safe but opt
   for H2 blocker in acute setting given potential for interaction of
   plavix with PPI.
   # Gout: renally dose allopurinol.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 83-year-old male with a history of aortic stenosis, chronic heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction (EF) of 45%, and three vessel disease (3VD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) twice and has multiple stents. The patient presented with dyspnea and elevated troponin levels, indicating possible acute on chronic systolic heart failure.

The patient was admitted with respiratory failure and was initially placed on invasive ventilation. He was successfully extubated but developed pulmonary edema overnight. He was started on nitroglycerin and lasix drips. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 106/90 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula.

The patient's lab results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels of 2.42 ng/mL, and elevated lactate levels of 2.7 mmol/L. The patient also has hypernatremia with a sodium level of 150 mEq/L and a calculated free water deficit of 2L.

   multiple stents p/w dyspnea and elevated troponin and probable CHF.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure:
   Extubated successfully but appears to have flashed into pulmonary edema
   overnight.  Given fevers to 101 and leukocytosis on presentation,
   started HCAP coverage with vanco/cefepime though no obvious
   consolidation on Xray. Antibiotics were DCed briefly, but pt became
   febrile by next AM, so antibiotics were restarted.  Patient with thick
   secretions still, appeared to have mucus plugged previously.  WBC
   increased today.
   - continue vanc/cefepime
   - continue lasix gtt in setting of pulmonary edema
   - CIS
   - f/u BCx, sputum cultures
   # Acute on Chronic Systolic Heart Failure.
   PA Cath DCed noted to have had elevated PCWP.  MvO2s low on
   presenation, but SVR high, likely cardiogenic shock.  Appears to have
   flashed into pulmonary edema last night.
   - diurese w lasix gtt
   - hold benicar, amlodipine, hydral, imdur
   # Paroxysmal Afib
   Had two episodes Afib in last 24hours, wedge and PA pressures increased
   temporarily during episode of Afib noted the day after admission; no PA
   catheter in anymore
   - cont metoprolol 25mg TID
   # Demand Ischemia.
   Troponin leak at outside hospital.  ECG here concerning for ischemia in
   major epicardial vessel, ?LIMA to LAD vs. stents of LMCA or LCx with
   intact LIMA.  Apparently echo unchanged from previous however.
   - ASA 325, Plavix 75, High dose statin
   - morphine for sedation
   - hold imdur/ranolazine
   # Critical Aortic Stenosis.
   Not intervenable as seen on Cath.  Valve area 1.2, not changed with
   dobutamine.
   - manage fluid status delicately
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:
   Stable, improved from admission.  Likely pre-renal from poor forward
   flow.
   - follow
   # Diabetes: hold metformin as going for cath.
   - HISS
   # GI: Famotidine while NPO.  On protonix at home.  Likely safe but opt
   for H2 blocker in acute setting given potential for interaction of
   plavix with PPI.
   # Gout: renally dose allopurinol.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently under comfort care measures in the ICU. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 72/49 mmHg to 110/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation and has a central venous pressure of 28.4 mmHg.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 1,797 mL and an output of 1,490 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 307 mL. The patient is receiving IV fluids at a rate of 770 mL per day.

The patient's laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 15.0 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, blood glucose level of 208 mg/dL, sodium level of 24 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 112 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 30.2%, BUN level of 73 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and troponin-T level of 2.42.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to sulfa (sulfonamides), Demerol (Oral) (Meperidine Hcl), Ambien (Oral) (Zolpidem Tartrate), Bacitracin, Hydrocortisone, Escitalopram, Neomycin, and Polymyxin B. The last doses of antibiotics administered were Vancomycin on 02/15/2107 at 10:30 AM and Cefipime on 02/15/2107 at 10:38 AM.

The patient is currently receiving morphine sulfate and lorazepam infusions for comfort measures. The patient's family wishes for comfort measures only have been respected.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case may include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, which can cause an irregular and often rapid heart rate. This condition can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart failure.
3. Fluid overload: The positive fluid balance suggests fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and compromised respiratory function.
4. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection, which can worsen the patient's overall condition.
5. Renal dysfunction: The elevated BUN and creatinine levels suggest potential renal dysfunction, which can be associated with inadequate fluid balance and electrolyte imbalances.
6. Respiratory compromise: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly elevated, and further deterioration in respiratory function may occur due to comfort care measures and potential underlying conditions.

It is important to monitor the patient closely for any changes in vital signs, respiratory function, fluid balance, and laboratory values to manage potential complications effectively."
