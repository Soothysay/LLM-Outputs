   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   The pt is a 58-year-old man with h/o heavy EtOH use who presented to
   the ED with altered mental status. The pt had been drinking 18-20 beers
   nightly for approximately 30 years, then quit ""cold [**Country **]"" on [**5-27**].
   He was taken to OSH by EMS after his partner called for altered MS.
   [**Name13 (STitle) 664**] CT was NL. He was xfered here
   On arrival to the ED: VS - Temp 98.3F, HR 130, BP 172/100, R 14, O2-sat
   96% 2L. Labs revealed platelets 71, elevated LFTs (45, 104, 99, 3.6),
   lactate 3.4, and ammonia 141. UA was negative, CXR was clear, and Head
   CT showed no acute intracranial process. He was intubated for airway
   protection and admitted to the MICU for further care. Blood and urine
   cultures were sent, and he was given Ceftriaxone 2g, Vancomycin 1g,
   Ampicillin 2g, and Acyclovir 1g given concern for meningitis. He did
   not have an LP [**12-22**] elevated INR 1.5.
 INVASIVE VENTILATION - START [**2137-7-12**] 07:17 PM

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of heavy alcohol use who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status. He had been drinking 18-20 beers nightly for approximately 30 years and then quit abruptly. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) after his partner reported altered mental status. On arrival, his vital signs were as follows: temperature 98.3F, heart rate 130 bpm, blood pressure 172/100 mmHg, respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96% on 2 liters of supplemental oxygen. Laboratory results revealed low platelets, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), lactate 3.4, and ammonia 141. Urinalysis was negative, chest X-ray was clear, and head CT showed no acute intracranial process. The patient was intubated for airway protection due to elevated ammonia levels and admitted to the MICU for further care. Blood and urine cultures were sent, and he was given broad-spectrum antibiotics. He did not undergo lumbar puncture. The patient received propofol for sedation, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, multivitamins, thiamine, and folate due to long-term heavy alcohol use. Head CT results were reviewed, and antibiotics were held as meningitis was considered unlikely. The patient's current vital signs are within normal limits, with stable hem"

   doubt meningitis with two weeks of altered MS and no fever.  Also
   consider Wernicke's - tx with thiamine.
   alchoholic hepatitis:  discriminate score about 29.  will ask
   hepatology if they feel treatment is warranted.
   respiratory failure:  will try to extubate once stooling and MS better.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with gait difficulty, slurred speech, and confusion after quitting drinking on [**5-27**]. He was initially treated for suspected meningitis but did not undergo a lumbar puncture. The patient was intubated to protect his airway due to poor mental status and high blood pressure. He received treatment for meningitis but without a tap. The patient required invasive ventilation and received propofol infusion at 30 mcg/kg/min. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 92 bpm (69-95 bpm), blood pressure ranging from 153/80 mmHg to 161/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (10-24 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 100%. 

Physical examination findings include well-nourished appearance, clear breath sounds, soft and non-tender abdomen, and no skin assessment performed. Neurological examination was not assessed. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6-5.9 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 53-57 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose level of 131-154 mg/dL, and various other lab values within normal ranges. 

The patient's assessment and plan include delirium/poor mental status, likely hepatic encephalopathy; doubt meningitis with altered mental status and no fever; consideration of Wernicke's encephalopathy treatment with thiamine; alcoholic hepatitis with discriminant score of 29; and respiratory failure with plans to extubate once stooling and mental status improve. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, hepatic encephalopathy, infections such as pneumonia or catheter-related bloodstream infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and complications related to alcohol withdrawal or Wernicke's encephalopathy."

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse. He presented with gait difficulty, slurred speech, and confusion after quitting drinking on [**5-27**]. He was initially taken to [**Hospital3 **] for vacation and later transferred to [**Hospital 3296**] due to poor mental status. A negative head CT was performed, but he was intubated to protect his airway. The patient received treatment for suspected meningitis but did not undergo a lumbar puncture. He was then transferred to the MICU6 and started on invasive ventilation at around 1830. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 153/80 to 161/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on propofol infusion at a rate of 30 mcg/kg/min. Other medications include vancomycin, which was administered at 08:00 PM on [**2137-7-12**]. 

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a total fluid input of 1,039 mL and 1,249 mL since 12 AM, with an output of 1,240 mL and 625 mL. His urine output is within normal range. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a ventilator set at a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and peak inspiratory pressure of 16 cmH2O. His arterial blood gas analysis indicates a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 37 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 400, and a respiratory system compliance index of 25. 

Physical examination reveals that the patient appears well-nourished and is not in acute distress. His cardiovascular and peripheral vascular systems are normal, as well as his respiratory system. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, and his skin is not assessed. Neurologic examination is incomplete due to the patient's unresponsiveness and inability to assess movement, tone, or sensation. 

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 5.6-5.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL, platelet count of 57-53 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose of 154 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.02 ng/mL. Other lab values include elevated liver enzymes, low albumin, and elevated lactate levels. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is diagnosed with delirium or poor mental status, most likely due to hepatic encephalopathy. Ethanol withdrawal is unlikely since the patient quit drinking on [**5-27**]. Lactulose is continued"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of heavy alcohol use who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, including confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait. She has been experiencing these symptoms for approximately 12 weeks and recently quit drinking alcohol. Laboratory results indicate mild ethanol hepatitis and other signs of chronic liver disease, such as low albumin levels, elevated INR, and low platelet count. Ammonia levels are high, suggesting possible hepatic encephalopathy. Other possible diagnoses include Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, infection, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is currently sedated and intubated due to airway protection, with plans for extubation today. She is also experiencing fever but does not have pneumonia on chest X-ray. The patient has cirrhosis and portal hypertension, as evidenced by an ultrasound examination. She is being treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, propofol for sedation, and multivitamins, thiamine, and folate supplementation. Antibiotics have been withheld because meningitis is unlikely given the time course. The patient's nutritional status is being assessed, and she will start tube feeds via nasogastric tube following extubation. Fluid replacement will be considered once she starts stooling."

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 142/73 mmHg to 165/97 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is sedated but appears responsive to stimuli. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance within normal limits.

Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters and regular cultures of respiratory secretions may be necessary.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as early mobilization and compression stockings should be considered.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and the use of medications like pantoprazole indicate a concern for stress-related mucosal disease. Monitoring for signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and maintaining appropriate acid suppression is important.
4. Fluid overload: Although the patient's fluid balance appears to be within normal limits, careful monitoring of intake and output is essential to prevent fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of heavy ethanol (EtOH) use who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait. She recently quit drinking EtOH. The patient has mild EtOH hepatitis, chronic liver disease indicated by low albumin, elevated INR, and low platelets. She also has high ammonia levels suggestive of possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and has been intubated for airway protection.

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's high ammonia levels and history of heavy EtOH use suggest a possibility of hepatic encephalopathy. This condition can lead to altered mental status, confusion, and other neurological symptoms.

2. Infection: As the patient has fever and elevated white blood cell count, there is a risk of infection. Infections can be particularly concerning in patients with compromised liver function.

3. EtOH Withdrawal: The patient recently quit drinking EtOH, which puts her at risk for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include tremors, seizures, and delirium tremens.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Weaning off the ventilator and successful extubation will be crucial to avoid further respiratory complications.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse admitted to the ICU with confusion and intubated. He has been receiving various treatments and medications including antibiotics, propofol, folate, thiamine, MVI, pantoprazole, and lactulose. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and stable blood pressure. His respiratory support includes CPAP/PSV ventilation mode with set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O. Blood cultures have been taken, and the patient is on multiple IV lines.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and altered mental status could be attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, which is supported by the presence of lactulose in his treatment plan. This condition occurs due to liver dysfunction and the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream that affect brain function.

2. Unclear Source of Fever: The patient's fever indicates an underlying infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to identify the source of the fever, as it can lead to complications such as sepsis if left untreated.

3. Respiratory Failure: Although the patient's current respiratory status appears stable, there is a risk of respiratory failure due to the patient being on mechanical ventilation. Extubation may be considered if the patient's condition improves"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of ethanol abuse, admitted to the ICU with confusion and subsequently intubated. He has been receiving various treatments and medications including propofol, vancomycin, folate, thiamine, MVI, pantoprazole, and lactulose. The patient's condition is complicated by encephalopathy, altered mental status, fever, respiratory failure, cirrhosis, and unclear sources of infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hepatic Encephalopathy: The patient's confusion and altered mental status may be indicative of hepatic encephalopathy, a condition caused by liver dysfunction.
2. Infection: The presence of fever suggests an underlying infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the source of infection.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is being supported by mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and extubation failure if not managed properly.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient's history of ethanol abuse raises the possibility of cirrhosis, which can lead to complications such as portal hypertension and hepatic insufficiency.
5. Drug-Related Complications: The use of medications like propofol and vancomycin may have potential side effects or drug interactions that need to be monitored.
6. Delirium: In critically ill patients, delirium is a common complication that can contribute to confusion and altered"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of heavy alcohol use who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait. She recently quit drinking alcohol. The patient has been diagnosed with mild ethanol hepatitis and other lab findings suggest chronic liver disease, including low albumin, elevated INR, and low platelets. She also has high ammonia levels, indicating possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was intubated for airway protection and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. She was extubated today.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status due to hepatic encephalopathy or Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.
2. Infection, as indicated by fever and positive blood cultures.
3. Respiratory failure, as the patient required invasive ventilation and is now on non-invasive ventilation.
4. Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis, which may lead to complications such as portal hypertension.
5. Malnutrition, as the patient is currently NPO (nothing by mouth) and may require nutritional support.
6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer due to prolonged immobility and critical illness.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged intubation.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be necessary to confirm these findings and"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 58-year-old woman with a history of heavy alcohol use.
- She presented to the emergency department with altered mental status, including confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait.
- She recently quit drinking alcohol.
- The patient has been experiencing these symptoms for 2-3 weeks.
- Laboratory tests show mild alcohol hepatitis and signs of chronic liver disease, including low albumin, elevated INR, and low platelets.
- Physical examination does not reveal many findings consistent with chronic liver disease.
- The patient's ammonia level is high, suggesting possible hepatic encephalopathy.
- Other possible conditions such as Wernicke-Korsakoff, infection, and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) are less likely.
- The patient's liver function tests are currently downtrending.
- Propofol is being used for sedation, which will also help with alcohol withdrawal.
- Lactulose is being given for hepatic encephalopathy, with the goal of reaching 3 bowel movements per day.
- Multivitamins, thiamine, and folate are being administered due to the patient's long history of heavy alcohol use.
- Antibiotics have been withheld as meningitis is unlikely given the time course.
- The patient is being weaned off ventilator support and plans for extubation have been made.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol use who presented with altered mental status, confusion, slurred speech, and unstable gait. He recently quit drinking alcohol. The ultrasound shows cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The patient's labs indicate mild ethanol hepatitis and signs of chronic liver disease, including low albumin levels, elevated INR, and low platelets. Ammonia levels are high, suggesting possible hepatic encephalopathy. The patient was treated with lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy and increased to 60mg QID dose to reach the goal of 3 bowel movements per day. He received MVI, thiamine, and folate due to his long history of heavy alcohol use. The patient's fever resolved, and he no longer requires respiratory support. His chronic liver disease requires further evaluation by hepatology. He needs an EGD to evaluate for esophageal varices and may require beta blockers for portal hypertension. The patient is on a low protein regular diet, repleted with electrolytes as needed, and given MVI, thiamine, folate, pneumoboots, and PPI prophylaxis. The patient's girlfriend will serve as the contact person for communication and the son's voicemail box is full, so he was given the hospital's number. The patient will be called out to the floor today.
