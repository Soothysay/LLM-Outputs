   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse, episode of a. fib s/p
   cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn, though patient denies fevers and
   there is no leukocytosis.
   - vanco/zosyn to cover pneumonia
   - send sputum culture and gram stain
   - possible extubation in PM after OR
   - albuterol, atrovent
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation versus MAT.  Patient had an episode of A. fib
   with RVR to 200s in ED, complicated by shortness of breath and ?altered
   mental status.  Unresponsive to dilt, so was cardioverted in ED.  Now
   in NSR.  Precipitant for A. fib/tachycardia remains unclear, but
   differential is hypoxia (post-obstructive LLL collapse, ?pneumonia),
   dehydration (given 2L IVF in ED, low CVP).  Has a CHADS2 score of
   three, but episode of A. fib with RVR began and ended in the ED and
   patient arrived in the ED in NSR.  Heparin drip started in the ED, but
   this was discontinued given that a. fib had resolved after
   cardioversion and he did not remain in A. fib for >48 hours.  Now off
   heparin and in NSR.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive in the ED in setting of receiving
   intubation meds and being on diltiazem drip.  Now normotensive off
   pressors.  CVPs low but responding to fluid bolus.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol)
   - fluid bolus for hypotension, low CVP
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 35-40%.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of
   cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases. He has been admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent in the trachea, left lower lobe collapse, an episode of atrial fibrillation following cardioversion, headaches, and hypotension. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and hyperlipidemia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C (99.5°F), a heart rate of 74 beats per minute, a blood pressure of 123/87 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and sedated, with pinpoint pupils.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as slightly elevated blood glucose levels. The kidney function tests indicate a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and the liver function tests are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination reveals poor air movement at the left lung base, with no signs of peripheral edema or other abnormalities. 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse, episode of a. fib s/p
   cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn, though patient denies fevers and
   there is no leukocytosis.
   - vanco/zosyn to cover pneumonia
   - send sputum culture and gram stain
   - possible extubation in PM after OR
   - albuterol, atrovent
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation versus MAT.  Patient had an episode of A. fib
   with RVR to 200s in ED, complicated by shortness of breath and ?altered
   mental status.  Unresponsive to dilt, so was cardioverted in ED.  Now
   in NSR.  Precipitant for A. fib/tachycardia remains unclear, but
   differential is hypoxia (post-obstructive LLL collapse, ?pneumonia),
   dehydration (given 2L IVF in ED, low CVP).  Has a CHADS2 score of
   three, but episode of A. fib with RVR began and ended in the ED and
   patient arrived in the ED in NSR.  Heparin drip started in the ED, but
   this was discontinued given that a. fib had resolved after
   cardioversion and he did not remain in A. fib for >48 hours.  Now off
   heparin and in NSR.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive in the ED in setting of receiving
   intubation meds and being on diltiazem drip.  Now normotensive off
   pressors.  CVPs low but responding to fluid bolus.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol)
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly which is concerning for
   non-functioning ventriculostomy.  Also has vasogenic edema in
   cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 35-40%.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of
   cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is an 81-year-old male with recently diagnosed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases.
- The patient underwent radiation therapy (XRT) and had a ventriculostomy placement.
- He was admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent in the left lower lobe (LLL), collapse of LLL, and an episode of atrial fibrillation (A. fib) after cardioversion in the emergency department (ED).
- The patient also presented with headaches, which are likely related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and non-functioning ventriculostomy.
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure of 123/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is intubated and sedated, with poor air movement at the left base.
- Laboratory results show leukocytosis, elevated troponin T, and other abnormalities.
- The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, hypotension, headache, small cell lung cancer, and chronic kidney disease (CRI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: Due to the migrated endobronchial stent causing LLL collapse, the patient is at risk of developing post-obstructive pneumonia."

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastasis, who presented with post-obstructive atelectasis and experienced an episode of atrial fibrillation (AFib) that was successfully cardioverted. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hyperlipidemia, and a previous myocardial infarction (MI). He underwent endobronchial stent placement and is currently receiving radiation therapy (XRT) to the brain. The patient is experiencing shortness of breath, poor air movement at the left lung base, headache, and nausea/vomiting. He is currently intubated and sedated.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Post-obstructive pneumonia: The patient's symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, along with distal collapse and poor air movement at the left lung base, indicate a potential complication.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient had an episode of AFib in the emergency department, which was unresponsive to diltiazem and required cardioversion. There is a risk of recurrence, especially with an unclear precipitant.
3. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive in the ED, possibly due to receiving intubation medications and being on diltiazem. Monitoring for further episodes is necessary.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer who has been admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient underwent stenting for a blocked left main bronchus but experienced migration of the stent to the trachea. 

The patient's current condition includes:
- Hypoxemic respiratory failure, likely due to stent migration and possible super infection in the collapsed left lower lobe.
- Atrial fibrillation (AF), which was initially present but is now in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) after receiving cardioversion in the emergency department.
- Hypotension, possibly related to intubation and sedation, requiring fluid bolus and holding anti-hypertensive medications.
- Headache, which is likely due to known metastases and ventriculomegaly with a shunt in place. Neurosurgical evaluation has been done, and there are no significant changes on the head CT.
- Renal failure, which appears to be at the patient's baseline renal function.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged intubation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobility and central venous catheters.
3. Nosocomial infections, especially considering the patient's history of MRSA.
4. Further deterioration of renal"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer metastasized to the brain. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has undergone stenting of the left main bronchus. However, the stent has migrated to the trachea. The patient's current condition includes atrial fibrillation (AF), hypotension, headache, and possible renal failure. He is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's underlying lung cancer and stent migration may lead to further respiratory complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: Due to the stent migration and compromised lung function, there is a risk of infection, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or a super infection in the collapsed left lower lobe.
3. Cardiac Complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation (AF) needs close monitoring, and there is a potential risk of arrhythmias or heart failure due to the patient's critical condition.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's renal function appears to be at baseline, but ongoing hypotension and fluid management could potentially worsen renal function.
5. Neurological Complications: The patient has a history of metastatic brain cancer and ventriculomegaly. There is a risk of worsening neurological symptoms or complications related to the shunt in place.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  Sputum culture shows staph
   aureus.   From a respiratory standing, patient is doing well, however,
   given hemodynamic instability in setting A. fib with RVR x 2 and
   unclear if pulmonary status is  triggering a. fib, will keep patient
   intubated today.
   - vanco/zosyn to cover pneumonia
   - f/u staph aureus sensitivities
   - albuterol, atrovent
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s yesterday after returning from OR.  Prior echo showed EF of
   35%. Patient was started on esmolol drip and amiodorone load.  Will dig
   load as well given that patient remains in A. fib.  Requiring neo off
   and on while in A. fib.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been precipitated by location of
   stent in trachea (cardia compression), tumor infiltration in atrium,
   volume overload.   Has a CHADS2 score of three, but given that patient
   has brain mets and recent brain surgery, will not anticoagulate him.
   - monitor on tele
   - amiodorone load
   - continue esmolol drip for rate control
   - digoxin load
   - cardiology consult for management of A. fib in this patient
   - echo
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive overnight requiring neo in setting
   of a. fib with RVR.  Now normotensive off pressors.  CVPs low but
   responding to fluid bolus.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol)
   - neo as needed to maintain maps> 60
   - check pulsus, echo to evaluate for pericardial effusion
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 35-40%.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of
   cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases who was admitted for a migrated endobronchial stent in the left lower lobe (LLL) causing collapse. The stent was removed, but the patient experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (A. fib with RVR) twice, leading to cardioversion in the emergency department. He also has headaches, likely related to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to bilateral ventriculomegaly and vasogenic edema in the cerebellum from radiation therapy. The patient's respiratory status has improved since the stent removal, but he remains intubated due to hemodynamic instability during the episodes of A. fib with RVR. He is currently on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, and his sputum culture shows Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's other medical conditions include a history of myocardial infarction (MI), atrial fibrillation, and chronic kidney disease (CRI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath (SOB) and the presence of Staphylococcus aureus in the sputum culture suggest a possible pneumonia. It is important to monitor for worsening respiratory symptoms, increased sput"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse, episode of a. fib s/p
   cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn, though patient denies fevers and
   there is no leukocytosis.
   - vanco/zosyn to cover pneumonia
   - send sputum culture and gram stain
   - possible extubation in PM after OR
   - albuterol, atrovent
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation versus MAT.  Patient had an episode of A. fib
   with RVR to 200s in ED, complicated by shortness of breath and ?altered
   mental status.  Unresponsive to dilt, so was cardioverted in ED.  Now
   in NSR.  Precipitant for A. fib/tachycardia remains unclear, but
   differential is hypoxia (post-obstructive LLL collapse, ?pneumonia),
   dehydration (given 2L IVF in ED, low CVP).  Has a CHADS2 score of
   three, but episode of A. fib with RVR began and ended in the ED and
   patient arrived in the ED in NSR.  Heparin drip started in the ED, but
   this was discontinued given that a. fib had resolved after
   cardioversion and he did not remain in A. fib for >48 hours.  Now off
   heparin and in NSR.
   - monitor on tele
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive in the ED in setting of receiving
   intubation meds and being on diltiazem drip.  Now normotensive off
   pressors.  CVPs low but responding to fluid bolus.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol)
   - fluid bolus for hypotension, low CVP
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 35-40%.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of
   cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastasis. He was admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent in the trachea, left lower lobe collapse, atrial fibrillation, and headaches. The stent was removed in the operating room, but this likely contributed to the patient's shortness of breath. He has been started on vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics to cover pneumonia. The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction, with an ejection fraction of 35-40%, and is on aspirin and a statin. He had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response that was cardioverted in the emergency department. His current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, amiodarone, esmolol, and diltiazem. The patient has a CHADS2 score of three and was on a heparin drip but was later discontinued due to resolution of atrial fibrillation. He is currently normotensive off pressors, but his central venous pressure (CVP) is low. The patient has bilateral ventriculomegaly and vasogenic edema in the cerebellum, which is likely related to radiation therapy. He continues to receive dexamethasone.

   ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left
   ventricular systolic dysfunction with mid to distal septal/apical
   hypokinesis. The distal inferior wall is also hypokinetic. No masses or
   thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no ventricular septal
   defect. with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve
   leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present.
   Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
   mildly thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
   tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is borderline
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small pericardial
   effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
   Compared with the report of the prior study (images unavailable for

   Assessment and Plan
   Thrombocytopenia
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  Sputum culture shows staph
   aureus so will continue with vanco.   Will extubate patient today given
   that patient is doing well on PS.
   - vanco to cover MRSA pneumonia
   - d/c zosyn
   - albuterol, atrovent
   - extubate
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s yesterday after returning from OR for stent removal.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been precipitated by location of stent in trachea (cardia
   compression), tumor infiltration in atrium, volume overload.  Echo

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases, admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent causing left lower lobe collapse. The patient underwent stent removal, but likely contributed to shortness of breath. The patient also experienced two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, one after returning from the operating room for stent removal, and the other in the setting of the migrated stent in the trachea. The patient was cardioverted with amiodarone and is now in normal sinus rhythm on digoxin and amiodarone. The patient's condition has improved, but there are several potential medical complications that can arise.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's recent episode of migrated endobronchial stent placement and subsequent removal may have contributed to post-obstructive pneumonia. The patient is already being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, but it is important to continue monitoring for any signs of infection and adjust antibiotic therapy if necessary.

2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to poor perfusion and potential stroke. It is crucial to monitor the patient's heart rhythm closely and manage any future episodes promptly.

3. Hypotension: The patient was hypot"

   Assessment and Plan
   Thrombocytopenia
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  Sputum culture shows staph
   aureus.   From a respiratory standing, patient is doing well, however,
   given hemodynamic instability in setting A. fib with RVR x 2 and
   unclear if pulmonary status is  triggering a. fib, will keep patient
   intubated today.
   - vanco/zosyn to cover pneumonia
   - f/u staph aureus sensitivities
   - albuterol, atrovent
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s yesterday after returning from OR.  Prior echo showed EF of
   35%. Patient was started on esmolol drip and amiodorone load.  Will dig
   load as well given that patient remains in A. fib.  Requiring neo off
   and on while in A. fib.  [**Month (only) 8**] have been precipitated by location of
   stent in trachea (cardia compression), tumor infiltration in atrium,
   volume overload.   Has a CHADS2 score of three, but given that patient
   has brain mets and recent brain surgery, will not anticoagulate him.
   - monitor on tele
   - amiodorone load
   - continue esmolol drip for rate control
   - digoxin load
   - cardiology consult for management of A. fib in this patient
   - echo
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive overnight requiring neo in setting
   of a. fib with RVR.  Now normotensive off pressors.  CVPs low but
   responding to fluid bolus.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol)
   - neo as needed to maintain maps> 60
   - check pulsus, echo to evaluate for pericardial effusion
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 35-40%.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of
   cardioversion, though no EKG changes noted.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of recently diagnosed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases who presented with several medical conditions. The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which increases the risk of bleeding.

2. Respiratory issues: The patient had a migrated endobronchial stent causing left lower lobe collapse, leading to shortness of breath. There is also a risk of post-obstructive pneumonia due to the migrated stent. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient experienced two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to hemodynamic instability. The patient has a history of SCLC with brain metastases, which may contribute to the development of atrial fibrillation.

4. Hypotension: The patient was hypotensive overnight but responded to a fluid bolus. There is a need to monitor and manage the patient's blood pressure.

5. Headache and increased intracranial pressure (ICP): The patient presents with severe frontal headaches associated with nausea and vomiting, likely related to increased ICP. This could be due to bilateral ventriculomegaly or vasogenic edema in the cerebellum caused by radiation therapy.

6. SCLC: The patient has been diagnosed with SCLC and is receiving radiation therapy to the brain. Further management will involve medical oncology.

7. Diarrhea: The patient reported diarrhea, which may be related to radiation therapy or other underlying conditions. A stool culture for Clostridium difficile should be sent.

8. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, and Lipitor should be continued.

9. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35-40%. Troponin levels were elevated during cardioversion, indicating possible myocardial injury.

10. Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI): The patient has impaired renal function, and medications should be dosed accordingly.

Potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, respiratory failure, stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to atrial fibrillation, hypotension leading to organ perfusion issues, increased ICP causing neurological deterioration, complications related to SCLC such as disease progression or treatment-related toxicities, and further deterioration of renal function."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of atrial fibrillation and right ventricular overload. The patient was managed by cardiology for atrial fibrillation and recommended continuing amiodarone (IV drip), digoxin (with the possibility of increasing the dose if needed), and stopping esmolol. The patient spontaneously returned to sinus bradycardia at around 7 pm. Amiodarone was changed to oral dosing (400 mg). 

The patient underwent vent changes to [**5-11**] and tolerated well, planning for extubation this morning. Diuresis was performed using 20 IV Lasix. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was done, showing an ejection fraction of 45-50%, focal wall motion abnormality (WMA), and a small effusion without tamponade. 

The patient has allergies to Zetia (Oral) due to a rash. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin on [**2161-11-18**] at 08:00 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on [**2161-11-19**] at 02:15 AM.

   81 y/o male with left lung met small cell CA to the brain s/p stenting
   with migration of the stent from the left main bronchus to the trachea.
   He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and his course has
   been complicated by Afib with RVR
    > Hypoxemic Resp failure: Multifocal in etiology, at least in part do
   to stent migration with possible super infection of the collapsed left
   lower lobe (chronic) which is at high risk for post obstructive process
   (we are currently growing out GPC). Has a hx of MRSA so will cover with
   Vanco and Pip-Tazo pending the results of the BAL from [**11-17**]. He is
   currently growing staph aureus from sputum (presumably MRSA), he is at
   high risk for repeated post obsx events. He conts  to have wheeze which
   is probably at least in part [**2-7**] TBM
   - Cont Vancomycin, D/C Pip-Tazo given sputum clx
   - D/c to goal net neg
   - Hopeful for extubation when MS improves, (stopped sedation 8AM)

 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)/Enzyme leak: received cardioversion in
   the ED (his first ED ECG was in NSR, then into AFib with RVR and now
   back in NSR). He had 2^nd episode of Afib with high RVR ([**11-17**]) now
   being managed with digoxin and amiodarone. His enzymes were elevated on
   [**11-18**] which is not surprising given that he had significant RVR on the
   evening of `[**11-17**].  We will cont to follow enzymes and ECG, appreciate
   cardiology input.
   - Follow enzymes, repeat ECG (some mild ST elevations in V2-V3, which
   have been present previously noted)
   - Cont amio and digoxin
   - Cont ASA and statin
   . > Headache: known mets and ventriculomegaly (with shunt in place),
   has been evaluated by neurosurg and our following. No change on head CT

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer that has spread to the brain. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and has experienced complications such as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and stent migration from the left main bronchus to the trachea. The patient's current condition includes wheezing, which may be due to tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), and an elongated left atrium with mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram. He also has mild thickening of the aortic and mitral valve leaflets, moderate mitral regurgitation, and trace aortic regurgitation. There is also a small pericardial effusion present.

The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, troponin-T, lactic acid, and LDH levels. His blood cultures indicate the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, which is likely methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The chest X-ray reveals increased opacification in the left lower lobe and right lower lobe atelectasis.

Plan:

The patient's current plan includes continuing vancomycin and discontinuing piperacillin/tazobactam due to sputum culture results. He will be monitored for negative net fluid balance, and hopes are for ext"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer metastasized to the brain, who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient underwent stenting but experienced migration of the stent from the left main bronchus to the trachea. The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, hypotension, headache, and renal failure. The patient is critically ill and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including the migration of the stent leading to possible super infection of the collapsed left lower lobe. This increases the risk of post-obstructive processes.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB): The patient has recently experienced episodes of AFIB, which can increase the risk of clot formation and embolism. However, since the patient was cardioverted back to normal sinus rhythm, empirical anticoagulation is not necessary at this time.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to intubation and sedation. Close monitoring and fluid bolus will be required. Holding his anti-hypertensive regimen for now is recommended.

4. Headache: The patient's headache may be related to his metastatic cancer and ventriculomegaly with a shunt in place. Neurosurgical evaluation has been"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer metastasized to the brain and subsequent stenting, which resulted in the migration of the stent from the left main bronchus to the trachea. He was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure and his condition has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR). The patient's medical history includes moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and risk factors for repeated post-obstructive events due to stent migration. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 142/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. He is receiving mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and supplemental oxygen at 40%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles and diffuse polyphonic wheeze in the respiratory system, as well as mild peripheral edema. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a WBC count of 16.8 K/uL, elevated troponin T levels, and other abnormalities in electrolytes and cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram shows mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction, moderate mitral regurgitation, trace aortic regurgitation, and borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  Sputum culture shows staph
   aureus so will continue with vanco.   Will extubate patient today given
   that patient is doing well on PS.
   - vanco to cover MRSA pneumonia
   - d/c zosyn
   - albuterol, atrovent
   - extubate
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s yesterday after returning from OR for stent removal.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been precipitated by location of stent in trachea (cardia
   compression), tumor infiltration in atrium, volume overload.  Echo
   showed not pericardial effusion with improved EF from prior and
   regional wall abnormalities.  Has a CHADS2 score of three, but given
   that patient has brain mets and recent brain surgery, will not
   anticoagulate him.  Patient cardioverted with amiodorone.  Now in NSR
   on digoxin, amiodorone.
   - monitor on tele
   - continue amiodorone, digoxin
   - appreciate cards recs
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive two days ago requiring neo in
   setting of a. fib with RVR.  Now normotensive off pressors and in NSR.
   No pericardial effusion or signs of tamponade on echo.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol), but consider
   resuming tomorrow if stable.
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 45% with regional wall motion
   abnormalities.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no
   EKG changes noted and rose again today after prolonged tachycardia in
   setting of a. fib.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .

","The patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases who was admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent in the left lower lobe (LLL) and an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He underwent stent removal in the operating room, which likely contributed to his shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and is on aspirin and a statin for coronary artery disease (CAD). He also has a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is being renally dosed with medications.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 36.7°C, Heart rate 64 bpm, Blood pressure 171/56 mmHg, Respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute, Oxygen saturation 100% on nasal cannula.
- Physical examination: General appearance - thin, Eyes/PERRL, Head/ears/nose/throat - normocephalic, Cardiovascular - normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, Peripheral vascular - pulses not assessed, Respiratory/chest - symmetric expansion, clear breath sounds bilaterally, scattered wheezes and rhonchi, Abdominal - soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present, Extremities - 1+ edema in both legs, Skin - not assessed,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has been extubated and is currently on CPAP/PSV ventilation with a nasal cannula. He is showing signs of increased left lower lobe atelectasis or consolidation on chest X-ray. The patient's troponin levels are rising, indicating possible demand ischemia due to prolonged atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's sputum culture was positive for MRSA, so Zosyn was stopped. The patient has been given 20 IV Lasix and has responded well to diuresis. The patient has a history of allergies to ezetimibe and has had previous doses of piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 171/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. The patient is in sinus rhythm. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative 2,442 mL over 24 hours. The patient's labs indicate elevated white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, and troponin levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for low potassium.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  SOB.  Patient has SCLC in LLL, s/p endobronchial stent placement on
   [**11-6**].  Stent now found to have migrated to trachea.  Bronch showed
   secretions with LLL collapse.   Went to OR to remove stent, but this
   likely contributed to patients SOB.  Given risk of post-obstructive
   pneumonia was started on Vanco/Zosyn.  Sputum culture shows staph
   aureus so will continue with vanco.   Will extubate patient today given
   that patient is doing well on PS.
   - vanco to cover MRSA pneumonia
   - d/c zosyn
   - albuterol, atrovent
   - extubate
   .
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s yesterday after returning from OR for stent removal.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been precipitated by location of stent in trachea (cardia
   compression), tumor infiltration in atrium, volume overload.  Echo
   showed not pericardial effusion with improved EF from prior and
   regional wall abnormalities.  Has a CHADS2 score of three, but given
   that patient has brain mets and recent brain surgery, will not
   anticoagulate him.  Patient cardioverted with amiodorone.  Now in NSR
   on digoxin, amiodorone.
   - monitor on tele
   - continue amiodorone, digoxin
   - appreciate cards recs
   .
   3.  Hypotension. Patient hypotensive two days ago requiring neo in
   setting of a. fib with RVR.  Now normotensive off pressors and in NSR.
   No pericardial effusion or signs of tamponade on echo.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol), but consider
   resuming tomorrow if stable.
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 45% with regional wall motion
   abnormalities.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no
   EKG changes noted and rose again today after prolonged tachycardia in
   setting of a. fib.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds
   .

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a recent diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases. He was admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent in the left lower lobe, which was removed but likely contributed to his shortness of breath. He also had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), one after the stent removal and the other after cardioversion. The patient has been extubated and is now on non-invasive ventilation. He has a history of myocardial infarction, with an ejection fraction of 45% and regional wall motion abnormalities. His current medications include amiodarone, digoxin, and aspirin. He has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient also has hyperlipidemia, which is being managed with Lipitor. He has chronic kidney disease (Cr at baseline) and is on renal dosing for his medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he continues to have headaches, likely related to increased intracranial pressure and vasogenic edema in the cerebellum from radiation therapy. His review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the recent episodes of AFib with RVR and shortness of breath. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's shortness of breath may be due to the migrated end"

   No pericardial effusion or signs of tamponade on echo.
   - hold antihypertensives (imdur, nifedipine, metoprolol), but consider
   resuming tomorrow if stable.
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5. ?diarrhea.  Per neurosurg note, patient reported diarrhea.  No
   history of this from family.
   - send stool c. diff
   .
   6.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   7.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 45% with regional wall motion
   abnormalities.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no
   EKG changes noted and rose again today after prolonged tachycardia in
   setting of a. fib.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a diagnosis of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases. He was admitted for a migrated endobronchial stent in the left lower lobe (LLL) collapse after stent removal, two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR), and headaches. The patient underwent cardioversion in the emergency department (ED) and has been in sinus rhythm since then. He also has a history of myocardial infarction (MI), regional wall motion abnormalities, and reduced ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. The patient's recent troponin levels have been elevated, indicating possible ischemia. His current medications include digoxin, amiodarone, albuterol, atrovent, vancomycin, dexamethasone, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's SCLC with LLL collapse and migrated endobronchial stent can lead to respiratory complications such as post-obstructive pneumonia, atelectasis, or further lung collapse.
2. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of MI, regional wall motion abnormalities, and reduced EF puts him at risk for cardiac complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, or myocardial ischemia.
3. Neurological Complications: The patient's headaches and bilateral ventriculome"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P:  Mr. [**Known lastname 2534**] is an 81 year old male with recently diagnosed SCLC
   with brain mets s/p XRT and ventriculostomy placment, admitted with
   migrated endobronchial stent with LLL collapse s/p stent removal,
   episode x 2 of a. fib with RVR s/p cardioversion in ED, and headaches.
   .
   1.  Post-obstructive PNA.  On vanco for post-obstructive PNA.  Afebrile
   and no leukoctyosis.  S/p bronchial stent removal.  Tolerated
   extubation yesterday well.
   - continue vancomycin
   - albuterol, atrovent
   2.  Atrial fibrillation.  Patient had a second episode of A. fib with
   RVR to 190s [**2161-10-18**]  after returning from OR for stent removal.  [**Month (only) 8**]
   have been precipitated by location of stent in trachea (cardia
   compression).  Echo showed not pericardial effusion with improved EF
   from prior and regional wall abnormalities.  Has a CHADS2 score of
   three, but given that patient has brain mets and recent brain surgery,
   will not anticoagulate him.  Patient cardioverted with amiodorone.  Now
   in NSR on digoxin, amiodorone.
   - monitor on tele
   - continue amiodorone, digoxin
   - appreciate cards recs
   .
   3.  Hypertension.  Previously hypotensive on pressors while in A. fib
   with RVR.  Now hypertensive in setting of being off home
   antihypertensives for several days.
   - resume imdur today and consider resuming nifedipine and then
   metoprolol if remains hypertensive
   .
   4.  Headache.  Patient presents with severe frontal daily headaches
   associated with nausea and vomiting.  Likely realated to increased
   ICP.  Noted to have bilateral ventriculomegaly. Per neurosurg, since
   there is no tube or shunt, low likelihood for malfunction.  Also has
   vasogenic edema in cerebellum where patient is receiving XRT.
   - continue dexamethase at current doses
   - speak with neurosurg re: assessing ventriculostomy function
   - speak with rad onc re: adjustement of dexa dose
   .
   4.  SCLC. Diagnosis confirmed by biopsy on bronch two weeks ago.  Now
   s/p endobronchial stent placement.  Getting XRT to brain and upon
   completion of this will meet with medical oncology team.
   - continue dexamethasone
   .
   5.  Hyperlipidemia
   - continue lipitor
   6.  CAD.  History of MI.  EF 45% with regional wall motion
   abnormalities.  Troponin up to 2 in setting of cardioversion, though no
   EKG changes noted and rose again today after prolonged tachycardia in
   setting of a. fib.   Enzymes trending down.
   - continue aspirin, statin
   - hold BB, but consider resuming if BP remains elevated
   - trend cardiac enzymes
   .
   8.  CRI.  Cr at baseline.
   - follow Cr
   - renally dose all meds

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and brain metastases, who was admitted with a migrated endobronchial stent and left lower lobe collapse after stent removal. He also had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, for which he received cardioversion. The patient has been extubated and is currently on non-invasive ventilation. He has a recent history of post-obstructive pneumonia and headaches, which are likely related to increased intracranial pressure due to bilateral ventriculomegaly and vasogenic edema in the cerebellum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has a history of post-obstructive pneumonia, and there is a potential risk of developing pneumonia due to his current respiratory support and immunocompromised state.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has had two episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, which can lead to hemodynamic instability and embolic events.
3. Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP): The patient's headaches and nausea/vomiting are likely due to increased ICP, which can be a result of brain metastases, vasogenic edema, and ventriculomegaly.
4. Hypertension: The patient has been hypertensive recently, and if not controlled, it can lead to end-organ damage.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer, who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory failure. He underwent stenting of the left main bronchus, but the stent migrated to the trachea. The patient's course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and possible super infection in the collapsed left lower lobe.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 171/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula. He is extubated and off mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the lungs, but with improved aeration. His abdomen is soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. Neurologically, he is alert and oriented, with purposeful movements and normal tone.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 7.4 to 16.8 K/uL, hemoglobin levels from 24.2 to 29.3 g/dL, platelet count from 113 to 172 K/uL, creatinine levels from 1.4 to 1.6 mg/dL, and troponin-T levels from 1.34 to 1"

","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and stent migration from the left main bronchus to the trachea. The patient is currently extubated and is being treated with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for suspected MRSA infection. The patient's respiratory status is stable with the use of CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator. His vital signs are within normal limits, and he is not in acute distress. The patient's laboratory results show some abnormalities, including elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, troponin T levels, and lactate levels. The patient's medical conditions include hypoxemic respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, headache, and renal failure. The patient's plan includes continuing with current medications, monitoring enzyme levels, and following up with cardiology recommendations. The patient is expected to be transferred to the floor soon.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Prolonged ventilatory support: The patient may require extended mechanical ventilation support due to the severity of his respiratory failure.
2. Infection: The patient has been treated with antibiotics for suspected MRSA infection, but there is a risk of developing other infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-related"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 81-year-old male with a history of small cell lung cancer who was admitted with hypoxemic respiratory failure. The patient's course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib/RVR) and stent migration from the left main bronchus to the trachea.

The patient was previously intubated but was successfully extubated yesterday. He is currently on nasal cannula and receiving supplemental oxygen. His vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 171/56 mmHg, heart rate of 64 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, temperature of 36.7°C, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for improved aeration in the lungs. Physical examination reveals crackles and wheezes in the chest, but with improved aeration. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. Neurologic examination shows purposeful movement and normal tone.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The patient has elevated levels of troponin T, lactate, lactic acid, and LDH. His electrolytes are within normal limits.

The patient's imaging reveals left lower lobe atelectasis, which has improved since yesterday. There are also lines of atelectasis in the right middle lobe and right lower l"
