","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gout, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. He presented with profuse bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass, which is suspected to be from the mass and above into the mouth/nares. The patient underwent oropharyngeal packing by ENT and coil embolization of the inferior thyroidal artery by interventional radiology (IR). He received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is now stable with a hematocrit (Hct) of 28.0%.

The patient is currently sedated with fentanyl, versed, and propofol, and is on invasive ventilation. His chest x-ray showed possible left lower lobe collapse, so increased positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was given for re-expansion of the left lower lobe (LLL). The plan is to wean mechanical sedation/ventilation as packing is now removed.

The patient experienced transient hypotension during initial sedation with fentanyl and versed bolus, as well as during ENT evaluation, but is currently hemodynamically stable. He has undergone tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement. The initial plan was for a dental procedure followed by chemotherapy and radiation for his recently diagnosed squamous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, gout, previous stroke, and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. He presents with profuse bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass. The bleeding was controlled by ENT packing, and airway control was maintained with a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF). He is currently sedated with fentanyl, versed, and propofol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to sedation with fentanyl, versed, and propofol.
2. Hypotension during initial sedation with fentanyl and versed bolus.
3. Bleeding from the tracheostomy site.
4. Infection at the tracheostomy site or nasal packing.
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.
6. Stress ulcer due to prolonged bed rest and sedation.
7. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to mechanical ventilation.
8. Malnutrition due to nil per os (NPO) status and potential need for long-term tube feeding.
9. Alcohol withdrawal since the family reports a history of heavy alcohol consumption and recent cessation.
10. Hyperglycemia due to stress response and potential need for glycemic control."

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, gout, previous stroke, and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. He presented with bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass. The bleeding was controlled by packing the tumor and coil embolization of the inferior thyroidal artery. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and is currently stable with a hematocrit of 28.0. He has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to airway compromise. The patient also has SCC of the larynx and will undergo dental procedures followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently on sedation with fentanyl, versed, and propofol. 

Potential Complications:
1. Bleeding: Given the patient's recent bleeding episode, there is a potential risk for further bleeding complications, especially if the source of bleeding is not completely controlled or if there are other underlying bleeding disorders.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently compromised due to sedation and mechanical ventilation. There is a risk of developing further respiratory failure if the ventilation settings are not adjusted appropriately or if there is an infection or other complications related to the tracheostomy tube.
3. Infection: Prolonged intubation and tracheostomy can increase the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or tracheostomy-related infections."

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), gout, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. The patient presented with profuse bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass, which was packed by ENT and coils were placed in the inferior thyroidal artery by interventional radiology (IR). The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently stable with a hematocrit (Hct) of 28.0%.

The patient's respiratory status is supported with invasive ventilation, tracheostomy tube, and arterial line. His vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.3°C, blood pressure ranging from 119/75 to 123/58 mmHg, heart rate between 66 and 79 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100% on room air. The patient remains sedated with fentanyl, versed, and propofol infusion.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count within normal range, slightly low hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, elevated platelet count, normal electrolytes, and kidney function. The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 100-117 mg/dL.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, gout, and previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). He was recently diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx. The patient presented with profuse bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass, which is suspected to be the source of the bleeding. He received pharyngeal packing by ENT and coils placed in the inferior thyroidal artery by interventional radiology (IR). The patient received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) and is currently stable with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 28.0.

The patient is sedated with fentanyl, versed, and propofol, and is on mechanical ventilation support through a tracheostomy tube. His respiratory status is being monitored closely. He also has a nasogastric (NG) tube in place. 

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count, but otherwise within normal limits. His electrolyte levels are also within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Maintain airway control with tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation.
2. Continue to monitor the patient's respiratory status and oxygen saturation levels.
3. Remove nasal packing once ENT and IR recommendations are obtained.
4. Continue prophylactic antibiotics with clindamycin due to poor"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male with a history of cancer and alcohol abuse, who presented to the hospital with active bleeding from the throat. The patient required pharyngeal packing by ENT and received three units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) upon arrival. He was then placed in the intensive care unit (ICU) and initiated on invasive ventilation and arterial line monitoring.

The patient has been receiving various medications, including fentanyl, propofol, midazolam (Versed), and clindamycin. His vital signs have been stable with a heart rate (HR) of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 123/58 mmHg to 151/65 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) set at 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) consistently at 100%. The patient's temperature (Tmax) is within normal range at 36.8°C (98.2°F) and his current temperature (Tcurrent) is 36.3°C (97.3°F).

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,395 mL with outputs totaling 545 mL via urine, 300 mL via nasogastric (NG) tube, and 12 mL via other drains. This results in a positive fluid balance of 2,850 mL. The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume (Vt) set"

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: Pt is a 66 y.o with h.o HTN, COPD, gout, s/p CVA, s/p newly dx
   laryngeal CA who presents with bleeding from mass.
   .
   #ENT-Pt with profuse bleeding from hypopharyngeal mass. No bleeding
   seen below the mass. Suspect bleeding is from the mass and above into
   the mouth/nares. ENT able to pack the tumor.
   -airway control with trach/vent for now.
   -4 PIVs
   -IR aware, will plan on CTA and embolization.
   -q4hr HCTs. Already transfused 3units of RBCs, transfuse for HCT <30.
   -active T+S
   -ENT following, appreciate recs.
   -nasal packing to remain in place.
   .
   #respiratory failure-secondary to sedation with
   fentanyl/versed/propofol.
   -after bleeding stabilized via ENT/IR procedures will wean ventilation.
   .
   #s/p hypotension-pt transiently hypotensive during initial sedation
   with propofol and versed. Transiently on neosyn during sedation/ENT
   evaluation. Currently off neosyn. S/p 4 units of PRBCs, and IVF.
   -monitor.
   .
   #SCC of the larynx-recently dx. S/p trach and G-tube. Plan is for
   dental procedure then chemo/radiation. This is the suspected source of
   bleeding.
   -ENT following
   -pt trached/ventilated/sedated for now until bleeding stabilizes.
   -consider heme/onc c/s
   .
   #HTN-will hold home meds until bleeding stabilizes.
   .
   #COPD-will monitor resp status/sats.
   .
   #Gout-hold allopurinol
   .
   #ETOH abuse-family states 14 beers daily, but none in ~2weeks. Had been
   getting ativan per family.
   -will monitor for signs of ETOH w/d.
   .
   #FEN-NPO for now
   -nutrition consult for tube feeds

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, gout, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. He presented with profuse bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass, which was controlled using packing by the ENT department. The patient has been placed on invasive ventilation and an arterial line. He has received 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and intravenous fluids (IVF). The bleeding is suspected to be secondary to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx, for which the patient is planned to undergo dental procedures followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing respiratory failure due to sedation with fentanyl, versed, and propofol. There is a risk of continued respiratory compromise if the sedation agents are not weaned off properly.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of transient hypotension during initial sedation with propofol and versed, as well as during ENT evaluation. Close monitoring is required to manage any further episodes of hypotension.
3. Bleeding: Although the bleeding has been temporarily controlled with packing, there is still a risk of re-bleeding from the hypopharyngeal mass. The patient's INR is elevated, indicating a potential bleeding tendency.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of hypertension, COPD, gout, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and newly diagnosed laryngeal cancer. The patient presented with bleeding from a hypopharyngeal mass, for which ENT packed the tumor and ordered coil embolization of the inferior thyroidal artery. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells and is now stable with a hematocrit of 28.0. The patient's airway is controlled with a tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. The patient's sedation will be weaned as packing is removed. The patient has SCC of the larynx and is planned for dental procedure followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The patient's other medical conditions include hypertension, COPD, gout, and ETOH abuse. The patient is NPO for now and will have a nutrition consult for tube feeds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Rebleeding: Given the patient's recent bleeding episode, there is a risk of rebleeding, especially if the source of bleeding is not completely controlled.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure secondary to sedation. Weaning off sedation and ventilation may be challenging, especially if the patient's lung function does not improve.
3. Infection: The patient has a tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube, which increase the risk of infection,"
