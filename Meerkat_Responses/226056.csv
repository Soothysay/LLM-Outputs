   Assessment and Plan
   73 year-old female with a PMH history of Parkinson's, protein C/S
   deficency, multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] to RP hematoma with IVC
   filter, CKD, s/p partial colectomy with ostomy who is transferred to
   the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] from OSH ([**Hospital6 117**]) for further management
   and evaluation of septic shock and respiratory failure.
    # Sepsis/recent septic shock - Source is resistant E.coli in urine and
   sputum sent at OSH. Initially treated with vanc, levo, flagyl and
   switched to Aztreonam once sensitivities returned. B/L basilar
   infiltrates on CXR. OSH was able to wean levophed day prior to
   admission and she arrived to the ICU with SBPs in the 140s where
   pressures have been since then. Precept catheter placed at OSH and is
   s/p aggressive IVF resuscitation.  WBC increased at 15 this morning
   from 13 on admission. Vancomycin and stress dose steroids d/c'ed on
   admission here.
   - needs PICC vs PIV today and will d/c R IJ
   - IV fluid boluses and Levophed if needed to maintain MAP > 65 and UOP
   > 30cc/hr  - has not needed any overnight
   - continue aztreonam for total of 8 days
   - Follow-up blood, urine, and sputum cultures  - sputum with 4+ GNR
   likely known E.coli
   - Trend WBC count and fever curve
   - urine legionella antigen pending
   -  influenza DFA pending
   # Respiratory failure - Most recent gas with PaO2 of 64 on PEEP of 15.
   PaO2: FiO2 ration is !20 well below the 200 cut off for low volume
   ventilation  Likely not oxygenation that well [**1-4**] secreations,
   interstitial edema, PNA. Pt was initially intubated for acute hypoxemic
   respiratory failure. Oxygenation improved from onset but remains poor
   with ABG upon arrival here 7.37/37/64 on TV 550, RR 20, PEE 10 FiO2
   50%. Poor lung volumes on CXR.
   - decreased V[T] to 4cc/kg in attempt to improve oxygenation.  Will
   recheck gas 1 hour after changing vent settings and adjust accordingly
   - copious secretions suctioned, sputum cx with 4+GNR, 1+ GPC
   - given CXR with fluid overload, and hx of dCHF on home Lasix, willl
   diurese with Lasix 80mg iv x1 with goal 1-1.5L negative.  CVP currently
   12, goal is 4.
   - will discuss with daughter goals of care/early trach, has been on MV
   for 5 days ([**12-19**] day 1)
 PNA likely [**1-4**] aspiration given her
   Parkinson
s which will happen again as her disease progresses.
   # PNA - CXR with B/L basilar infiltrates. E.coli growing from sputum.
   Pt likely aspirated at her nursing home given PD.
   - will continue treatment for now with aztreonam
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - DFA for influenza pending, urine legionella antigen pending
   - no urgent need currently for bronchoscopy, will discuss in AM
   - if appears clinically worsened or secretions increase significantly,
   have low threshold for restarting vancomycin as this was d/c
ed on
   admission given E.ocli in sputum from OSH
   # Hypernatremia: 152 this morning, likely [**1-4**] to tube feeds at OSH
   - received 500cc D5W bolus this morning
   - pm lytes
   - d5W boluses prn
   # Abdominal Distension:  On Exam, ostomy has had high output but there
   appears to be a piece of stool in otsomy orifice. Also with
   asymmetrically distened abdomen around ostomy site, soft, NT
   - KUB
   - ostomy wound care c/s
   # HTN:  to 160
s this morning, clinically fluid overloaded
   - Lasix as above
   - trend
   # UTI
   - f/u urine culture
   - continue treatment with aztreonam
   # Nongap metabolic acidosis
Resolving, at 14 this morning down from 17
   on admission. Likely [**1-4**] to increased colostomy output. C.diff negative
   x 1
   - f/u repeat c. diff
   # ARF on CRI
 Improving. Thought to be [**1-4**] to ATN given
   hypotension/septic shock plus recent Toradol. Improved greatly with
   IVF.
   - continue to trend creatinine, baseline around 2, renally dose all
   meds
   # PD - Continue Sinemet and Requip
   # Protein C/S deficiency - h/o DVT and PE. INR subtherapeutic. On
   heparin gtt overnight and Coumadin held.
   - will hold heparin gtt this morning in anticipation of PICC
   placement.  Will restart after.
   - continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given likely
   aspiration and high likelihood of repeat aspiration as above
   # Anemia
 32, stable. Likely chronic disease. Initial HCT was 39 at
   OSH ED, likely concentrated. Will monitor for bleeding for right now
   and trend daily HCT.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management and evaluation of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Sepsis/recent septic shock - The source of infection is resistant E. coli in urine and sputum. She was initially treated with vancomycin, levofoxacin, and Flagyl, and then switched to aztreonam based on the sensitivity results. The patient has bilateral basilar infiltrates on chest X-ray.
2. Respiratory failure - The patient's PaO2 is below the cutoff for low volume ventilation, indicating poor oxygenation. She was initially intubated for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Lung volumes on chest X-ray are poor.
3. Pneumonia (PNA) - The patient likely aspirated at her nursing home given her Parkinson's disease. There are basilar infiltrates on chest X-ray with E. coli growing from sputum.
4. Hypernatremia - The patient's sodium level is elevated at 152, likely due to tube feeds at OSH. She received a 500cc D5W bolus this morning.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for further management and evaluation of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has several potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient is being treated for septic shock with resistant E. coli in her urine and sputum. She was initially treated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole, and then switched to aztreonam based on sensitivities. Bilateral basilar infiltrates on chest X-ray suggest possible pneumonia.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially required intubation for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Despite improvements in oxygenation, her PaO2 remains low on a PEEP of 15. The plan is to increase PEEP to 15 to improve oxygenation, as peak pressures and minute ventilation are adequate.

3. Pneumonia (PNA): The patient has bilateral basilar infiltrates on chest X-ray, and E. coli is growing from her sputum. She likely aspirated at her nursing home given her percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube.

4. Hypernatremia:"

   HPI:
   73 yo female with Protein C + S deficiency and parkinsons disease who
   presents with prodome of malaise and found to have respiratory failure
   and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggesting multifocal pneumonia or

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with Protein C and S deficiency, Parkinson's disease, presenting with malaise, respiratory failure, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggesting multifocal pneumonia or acute lung injury. The E. Coli infection is significant due to its resistance pattern, possibly a consequence of frequent hospitalizations/institutionalization. The patient has persistent hypoxemia, which may be attributable to derecruitment of lung units along with significant pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 550 mL, respiratory rate set at 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and has an ABG result of 7.42/33/64/18/-1.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if the underlying pneumonia and acute lung injury are not adequately treated.
2. Sepsis: The patient is at risk of sepsis due to the E. Coli infection, especially considering her immune system compromised by Protein C and S deficiency.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has signs of acute renal failure, which can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's elevated serum sodium levels indicate hypernatremia, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances if not corrected.
5. Recurrent Aspiration: The patient's underlying"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with Protein C and S deficiency, Parkinson's disease, and a history of frequent hospitalizations/institutionalization. She presents with respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates suggesting multifocal pneumonia or acute lung injury. There is no suggestion of pulmonary hemorrhage in sputum evaluation and analysis. The patient has consistent and persistent hypoxemia which may be attributable to derecruitment of lung units in addition to significant pneumonia, possibly a combination of aspiration and persistent E. Coli infection.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of multiple medical conditions, including Parkinson's disease, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, protein C and S deficiency, and a sacral decubitus ulcer. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, severe sepsis, possible recurrent aspiration, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, and protein C and S deficiency. They also have a sacral decubitus ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration in lung function and potentially result in pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Severe Sepsis: The patient is suffering from severe sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that can cause organ dysfunction and failure. It may progress to septic shock if not treated promptly and effectively.
3. Recurrent Aspiration: Given the patient's underlying Parkinson's disease, there is a possibility of recurrent aspiration, which can increase the risk of pneumonia and other respiratory complications.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is a condition characterized by high levels of sodium in the blood. If left untreated, it can lead to dehydration, seizures, and other neurological complications.
5. Acute Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal failure, which can result in the accumulation of waste products"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, Protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She has a fever and leukocytosis, suggesting that her current antibiotics may not be covering all sources of infection. Her blood cultures and urine cultures have been sent for analysis. The patient's ABG results indicate adequate perfusion and oxygenation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a possible ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of respiratory status and cultures will help monitor for this complication.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Due to the patient's history of VTE and immobilization, there is an increased risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures such as heparin gtt should be continued.
4. Autonomic dysreflexia: As the patient has a spinal cord injury, there is a risk of autonomic dysreflexia, which is characterized by sudden hypertension and br"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, severe sepsis, possible recurrent aspiration, hypernatremia, acute renal failure, protein C & S deficiency, and sacral decubitus ulcer. 

The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, likely due to underlying pneumonia and acute lung injury, as well as evidence of increased pulmonary edema. The plan includes continuing treatment for pneumonia, monitoring compliance, and potentially weaning sedation.

Severe sepsis is suspected, with a likely pulmonary source and urinary infection. The possible aspiration trigger is also considered, and the patient is being treated with aztreonam and vancomycin. A follow-up pan culture is planned.

Recurrent aspiration is a concern, especially given the patient's Parkinsonism. Tracheostomy may be considered to aid in toileting and weaning from mechanical ventilation.

The patient has hypernatremia, which is improving with free water administration enterically. Acute renal failure is resolving, but there may be chronic kidney disease and a new set point. Monitoring with diuresis is ongoing.

Protein C & S deficiency is noted, and the patient is receiving heparin gtt for now. An IVC filter is in place, and anticoagulation will be resumed once critical care issues resolve.

A sacral decubitus ulcer requires wound care management. The patient's code status was initially DNR/DNI but was reversed at OSH."

   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 19.1. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Given patient
s allergies to beta
   lactams and improvement of WBC, will not change antibiotic regimen at
   this time. Blood and urine Cx taken, RIJ catheter tip has been cultured
   and is pending.
   - Continue vancomycin every other day and aztreonam q8h daily.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   - RIJ Catheter Cx pending
   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Most current ABG 7.41/ 34/ 86, which is
   appropriate for her level of sedation and respirator status.
   - Can decrease the PEEP to 10cmH20 given patient
s improving
   oxygenation status
   - Will follow with respiratory
   - Will decrease level of sedation on midazolam and fentanyl
   - Will plan for RSBI on Monday in preparation for extubation
   - Will discuss with daughter today regarding need for

   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have markedly
   decreased pulmonary edema. Given GPCs in the sputum, high WBC and
   fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or strep, so will continue
   vancomycin started this morning DFA negative. Legionella Ag negative
   -Continue aztreonam and vancomycin
   -F/U final read on today
s CXR
   -No urgent need for bronchoscopy
   #Anemia: Stable at 28 with no evidence of bleeding, so goal Hct should
   be around 25. Patient
s lactate yesterday was 1.2 and ABG is acceptable
   at 7.41/34/86, so patient is adequately perfusing tissue
   -Will monitor crit q day.
   #Hypernatremia: Now 152. This may be due to insensible water losses
   without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or may be a
   function of NS boluses given to the patient in the face of her poor
   baseline renal function. Will need to correct slowly (less than
   0.5mEq/hr)  to prevent cerebral edema.
   -Continue D5W fluid boluses- given 500mL this morning
   -Continue to trend
   #Abdominal distention: KUB showed no evidence of SBO, ostomy not
   impacted per nurse
   -Continue to monitor output
   -Continue ostomy care
   #Nongap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Anion gap is 11 and patient

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with multiple medical conditions including Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. The patient was admitted to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current status is as follows:
- Vital signs: Temperature 38.2°C (100.8°F), heart rate 86 bpm, blood pressure 169/54 mmHg, respiratory rate 25 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation 95% on FiO2 50%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on a ventilator with set tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The most recent arterial blood gas (ABG) shows pH 7.41, PaCO2 34 mmHg, and PaO2 86 mmHg.
- Fluid balance: The patient has received a total of 3,448 mL of fluids since 12 AM, with an output of 3,385 mL including 1,688 mL of intravenous fluids, 720 mL of tube feedings, and 1,905 mL of urine output.
- Blood cultures were obtained and the patient is on caspofungin due to budding yeast seen in the blood culture. The patient is also receiving vancomycin and aztreonam for suspected Gram-negative bacterial infection.
- The patient's white blood cell count is 19.1 x 10^9/L, which is trending downward, indicating improvement.
- The patient's serum creatinine is 2.3 mg/dL, which has improved from 2.6 mg/dL two days ago, suggesting improvement in acute renal failure (ARF).
- The patient's sodium level is 152 mEq/L, which needs to be corrected slowly to prevent cerebral edema.
- The patient's platelet count is 191 x 10^9/L.
- The patient's blood cultures show sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. However, due to allergies to beta-lactams, the antibiotic regimen will not be changed at this time.
- The patient's sputum culture is positive for E. coli, a multi-resistant organism.
- The patient's chest X-ray shows bilateral basilar infiltrates and marked improvement in pulmonary edema.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Nosocomial bloodstream infection due to the presence of budding yeast in the blood culture.
3. Acute kidney injury (AKI) due to ongoing renal dysfunction and fluid imbalance.
4. Pressure ulcers or skin breakdown due to prolonged immobilization and pressure from the ventilator.
5. Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) due to high tidal volumes and high PEEP settings.
6. Delirium or ICU psychosis due to the use of sedative medications such as midazolam and fentanyl.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to the patient's history of multiple VTE events and prolonged immobilization.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's respiratory status, fluid balance, renal function, and mental status to prevent these potential complications."

","The patient is a 59-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure. The patient has a history of Parkinson's disease, sacral decubitus ulcer, and is on multiple medications including zocor, ropinerol, sinemet, and prilosec. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.2 C (100.8 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 159/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (19.1 K/uL), hematocrit (28.0%), platelet count (191), creatinine (2.3 mg/dL), total CO2 (22 mmol/L), glucose (135 mg/dL), and lactic acid (1.1 mmol/L). The patient's electrolytes show hypernatremia (Na+: 148 mEq/L) and acute renal failure with a stable creatinine level of 2.2 mg/dL.

The patient's physical examination reveals signs of respiratory distress, including diminished peripheral pulses and rhonchi on auscultation. The patient is also noted to be overweight/obese, with non-tender and obese abdomen. Neurological examination shows the patient follows simple commands, responds to verbal stimuli, is sedated, and has normal muscle tone"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 19.1. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Given patient
s allergies to beta
   lactams and improvement of WBC, will not change antibiotic regimen at
   this time. Blood and urine Cx taken, RIJ catheter tip has been cultured
   and is pending.
   - Continue vancomycin every other day and aztreonam q8h daily.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   - RIJ Catheter Cx pending
   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Most current ABG 7.41/ 34/ 86, which is
   appropriate for her level of sedation and respirator status.
   - Can decrease the PEEP to 10cmH20 given patient
s improving
   oxygenation status
   - Will follow with respiratory
   - Will decrease level of sedation on midazolam and fentanyl
   - Will plan for RSBI on Monday in preparation for extubation
   - Will discuss with daughter today regarding need for
   #PNA: CXR yesterdaywith b/l basilar infiltrate. E. coli growing from
   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have markedly
   decreased pulmonary edema. Given GPCs in the sputum, high WBC and
   fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or strep, so will continue
   vancomycin started this morning DFA negative. Legionella Ag negative
   -Continue aztreonam and vancomycin
   -F/U final read on today
s CXR
   -No urgent need for bronchoscopy
   #Anemia: Stable at 28 with no evidence of bleeding, so goal Hct should
   be around 25. Patient
s lactate yesterday was 1.2 and ABG is acceptable
   at 7.41/34/86, so patient is adequately perfusing tissue
   -Will monitor crit q day.
   #Hypernatremia: Now 152. This may be due to insensible water losses
   without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or may be a
   function of NS boluses given to the patient in the face of her poor
   baseline renal function. Will need to correct slowly (less than
   0.5mEq/hr)  to prevent cerebral edema.
   -Continue D5W fluid boluses- given 500mL this morning
   -Continue to trend
   #Abdominal distention: KUB showed no evidence of SBO, ostomy not
   impacted per nurse
   -Continue to monitor output
   -Continue ostomy care
   #Nongap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Anion gap is 11 and patient
   patient
s acid-base status is within normal limits. ABG was normal at
   7.41/ 34/ 86. Likely secondary to increased colostomy output. C. Diff
   negative x1
   #Protein C/S deficiency: INR at 1.9. Heparin gtt overnight. No signs or
   symptoms of VTE
   - Will continue heparin drip
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   #ARF: Improving with Cr of 2.3 down from 2.6 2 days ago. Likely ATN
   secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with multiple comorbidities including Parkinson's disease, Protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient's current condition is as follows:
- Vital signs: Tcurrent: 37.2 C (98.9 F), HR: 89 bpm (75-97 bpm), BP: 134/53 mmHg (74-169/44-88 mmHg), RR: 27 breaths/min (24-32 breaths/min), SpO2: 94%.
- Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient is on vasopressors (Heparin Sodium - 1,700 units/hour).
- Fluid balance: Total In: 3,722 mL, PO: 720 mL, IVF: 1,842 mL, Blood products: 2,695 mL, Urine: 1,470 mL, NG: Not assessed, Stool: Not assessed, Drains: Not assessed, Balance: 1,027 mL (-269 mL).
- Respiratory support: The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%.
- Labs: WBC: 19.1 K/uL, Hct: 28.0%, Plt: 191 K/uL, Cr: 2.3 mg/dL, TCO2: 22 mmol/L, Glucose: 135 mg/dL, PT/PTT/INR: 15.9/75.2/1.4, etc.

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: The patient has leukocytosis trending downward and sources previously found to be Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum. She is sensitive to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Given her allergies to beta-lactams and improvement of WBC, no change in antibiotic regimen is made. Blood and urine cultures are pending.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient's current ABG is appropriate for her level of sedation and respirator status. PEEP can be decreased to 10 cmH2O given the patient's improving oxygenation status.
3. Pneumonia: CXR shows bilateral basilar infiltrate with E. coli growing from sputum. Given GPCs in the sputum, high WBC, and fevers, this pneumonia could be due to Staph or Strep. Vancomycin will be continued.
4. Anemia: Stable at 28% with no evidence of bleeding. Goal H"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 17.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Although her leukocytosis is improving she is still
   continuing to have fevers. She does have broad coverage with Vancomycin
   and Aztreonam however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe we
   are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her fever
   history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and continues
   whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing to q24hr,
   even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the change in
   dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will recheck levels
   tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to have a positive
   fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been
   positive however even with on positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt
   was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also consult ID
   regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for the positive
   fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in place <24 hours
   since admission and has been d/c
   - Given low troughs will change Vancomycin dosing frequency to qday,
   will recheck trough tomorrow AM
   - Continue aztreonam q8h daily.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   - RIJ Catheter Cx pending
   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.
   - Will decrease level of sedation on midazolam and fentanyl
   - Will continue current vent settigns given her other issues
   - Will discuss with daughter today regarding need for tracheostomy
   #PNA: CXR yesterdaywith b/l basilar infiltrate. E. coli growing from
   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have markedly
   decreased pulmonary edema. Given GPCs in the sputum, high WBC and
   fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or strep, so will continue
   vancomycin started this morning DFA negative. Legionella Ag negative
   -Continue aztreonam and vancomycin as mentioned previously
   -F/U final read on today
s CXR
   -No urgent need for bronchoscopy
   #Hypernatremia: Now 153 up from 148 even with increased free water
   administration. His hypernatremia is likely due to insensible water
   losses without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or may
   be a function of NS boluses given to the patient in the face of her
   poor baseline renal function. Will increase her free water bolus to
   200ml from q6 to q4 and assess response.
   -Increase free H20 bolus with TF to 200cc q4hrs
   -Continue to trend
   # Access: Pt currently has femoral line in place, would prefer SCL line
   particularly as we could obtain CVP reads to guide us on dirueses
   therapy. Will place SCL today, will hold heparin gtt hour prior to
   procedure. Will also transduce CVP from SCL.
   - Place SCL today
   - Obtain CVP from SCL line once placed
   #Protein C/S deficiency: INR at 1.9. Heparin gtt overnight. No signs or
   symptoms of VTE
   - Will continue heparin drip
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   #ARF: Improving with Cr of 2.2 down from 2.3 yesterday. Likely ATN
   secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine
   #Parkinson
s Disease: Stable. Continue carbidopa/levodopa and Requip
   #HTN: Stable at 120/50s this morning s/p Lasix.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted for septic shock and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), pneumonia, hypernatremia, and acute renal failure (ATN). She has allergies to beta-lactams and is currently being treated with multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin and aztreonam. She also has a positive fungal culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever and leukocytosis indicate ongoing infection. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient's fever persists, suggesting a possible antibiotic-resistant infection or inadequate dosing of vancomycin.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a low tidal volume strategy, but there may be a need for tracheostomy due to her lack of progress on the ventilator.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's sputum culture shows sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. However, she has an allergy to beta-lactams, so alternative treatment options need to be considered.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels are elevated, and"

   source.
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION--Concerning pattern of persistent
   fevers and low level bandemia noted.  This is despite optimal
   antibiotics since admission and is in the setting of drug resistant E.
   Coli identified.  She has been off pressors which has been
   encouraging.  E. Coli we have seen is sensitive to current
   antibiotics.  Of concern is the yeast seen on blood culture x1 and
   favor early intervention

   subclavian CVL this pm.
   -Will have ID consult for consideration of further evaluation of
   fungemia as isolated sample to consider further definition of sources.
   Optho examination today
   -Vanco redose today
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])--He has persistent tenuous
   oxygenation in the setting of elevated PEEP levels.  The original
   source for intubation was hypoxemic respiratory failure with E. Coli
   related pneumonia but now in the setting of significant volume overload
   has persistent PEEP responsive hypoxemia.  In this setting she has
   continued non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema contributing which in the
   setting of obestity and resultant chest wall restriction this will make
   ventilator weaning a challenge.
   -Will maintain even to negative fluid balance over time if BP tolerates
   and electrolytes stable will move to negative fluid balance and
   evaluate effective ventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of partial colectomy, Parkinson's disease, and Protein C and S deficiency. She was admitted to the ICU with E. Coli sepsis from a urinary source. The patient has been experiencing persistent fevers, low level bandemia, and is off pressors. The identified E. Coli is sensitive to current antibiotics, but there is concern about yeast seen on blood culture. The patient has respiratory failure due to hypoxemic respiratory failure with E. Coli-related pneumonia and significant volume overload. She also has hypernatremia, coagulopathy, and Parkinson's disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's persistent fevers and low level bandemia indicate ongoing infection. The presence of yeast in the blood culture suggests a potential fungal infection, which may require antifungal treatment.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's tenuous oxygenation and persistent PEEP-responsive hypoxemia indicate difficulty weaning off the ventilator. This could be due to pulmonary edema, obesity, and chest wall restriction.
3. Hypernatremia: Despite free water bolus, the patient's hypernatremia persists. There is a continued free water deficit that needs to be addressed.
4. Coagulopathy: The patient has a coagulation disorder, as indicated by elevated PT and PTT levels. Heparin therapy is being held due to the"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 12.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Although her leukocytosis is improving she is still
   continuing to have fevers. She does have broad coverage with Vancomycin
   and Aztreonam however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe we
   are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her fever
   history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and continues
   whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing to q24hr,
   even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the change in
   dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will recheck levels
   tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to have a positive
   fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been
   positive however even with one positive result fungemia is a concern.
   Pt was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also consult ID
   regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for the positive
   fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in place <24 hours
   since admission and has been d/c
   - Given low troughs will change Vancomycin dosing frequency to qday,
   will recheck trough tomorrow AM
   - Continue aztreonam q8h daily.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   - RIJ Catheter Cx pending
   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.
   - Will decrease level of sedation on midazolam and fentanyl
   - Will continue current vent settigns given her other issues
   - Will discuss with daughter today regarding need for tracheostomy
   #PNA: CXR yesterdaywith b/l basilar infiltrate. E. coli growing from
   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have markedly
   decreased pulmonary edema. Given GPCs in the sputum, high WBC and
   fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or strep, so will continue
   vancomycin started this morning DFA negative. Legionella Ag negative
   -Continue aztreonam and vancomycin as mentioned previously
   -F/U final read on today
s CXR
   -No urgent need for bronchoscopy
   #Hypernatremia: Now 153 up from 148 even with increased free water
   administration. His hypernatremia is likely due to insensible water
   losses without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or may
   be a function of NS boluses given to the patient in the face of her
   poor baseline renal function. Will increase her free water bolus to
   200ml from q6 to q4 and assess response.
   -Increase free H20 bolus with TF to 200cc q4hrs
   -Continue to trend
   # Access: Pt currently has femoral line in place, would prefer SCL line
   particularly as we could obtain CVP reads to guide us on dirueses
   therapy. Will place SCL today, will hold heparin gtt hour prior to
   procedure. Will also transduce CVP from SCL.
   - Place SCL today
   - Obtain CVP from SCL line once placed
   #Protein C/S deficiency: INR at 1.9. Heparin gtt overnight. No signs or
   symptoms of VTE
   - Will continue heparin drip
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   #ARF: Improving with Cr of 2.2 down from 2.3 yesterday. Likely ATN
   secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy. She was transferred to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypernatremia, pneumonia, and possible fungemia.

The patient's condition has been unstable, with fevers, leukocytosis, and positive fungal culture. She required multiple interventions, including changes in antibiotic therapy, placement of central lines, and management of her hypernatremia, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. The patient's renal function has been improving, and her blood pressure has been stable after receiving lasix.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive cultures indicate ongoing infection and the need for continued aggressive management.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. Weaning from the ventilator has been challenging, and the patient's lack of progress has led to discussions about the need for a tracheostomy.

   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 12.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Although her leukocytosis is improving she is still
   continuing to have fevers. She does have broad coverage with Vancomycin
   and Aztreonam however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe we
   are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her fever
   history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and continues
   whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing to q24hr,
   even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the change in
   dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will recheck levels
   tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to have a positive
   fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been
   positive however even with one positive result fungemia is a concern.
   Pt was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also consult ID
   regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for the positive
   fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in place <24 hours
   since admission and has been d/c
   - am vanc trough was drawn too early
 will recheck random tonight and
   dose tonight is <15 (per ID recs), trough should be cheked 30-60
   minutes prior to dosing , day 1 [**2167-12-28**]
   - continue meropenem for 14 days

   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.
   - CXR appears wet
 will start lasix gtt for gentle diuresis goal -1L
   today
   - after meet I/O goal, will attempt to wean PEEP to 10
   - to discuss trach with family on Thursday at 4am
   #PNA: CXR 2 days ago with b/l basilar infiltrate. E. coli growing from
   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have
   Unchanged pulmonary edema from yesterday
s x-ray. Given GPCs in the
   sputum, high WBC and fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or
   strep, so will continue vancomycin as above. Legionella Ag negative
   - continue vanco and [**Last Name (un) 430**] as above
   #Hypernatremia: at 145 this morning, has been labile even with
   increased free water administration. Her hypernatremia is likely due to
   insensible water losses without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy
   output, or may be a function of NS boluses given to the patient in the
   face of her poor baseline renal function. Will continue to increase her
   free water boluses to as needed and assess response.
   - free H20 bolus with TF to 200cc q4hrs

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease who was admitted with respiratory failure and sepsis. The patient has been experiencing persistent hypoxemia, increasing secretions, and significant volume overload, which are barriers to extubation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for an extended period, increasing the risk of developing VAP. The healthcare team is implementing measures to prevent VAP, such as elevating the head of bed, performing regular mouth care, and assessing respiratory system infection indices (RSBI).

2. Central venous line-associated bloodstream infection (CVL-BSI): The patient had a central venous line placed, which increases the risk of developing a bloodstream infection. The healthcare team has changed the central venous line and is monitoring for signs of infection.

3. Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI): The patient has been catheterized, which increases the risk of developing a urinary tract infection. The healthcare team should monitor for signs of infection and consider removing or replacing the urinary catheter if necessary.

4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Due to the patient's immobility and prolonged bed rest, there is an increased risk of developing DVT and PE. The healthcare team has initiated prophylaxis with heparin to prevent"

   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 12.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Although her leukocytosis is improving she is still
   continuing to have fevers. She does have broad coverage with Vancomycin
   and Aztreonam however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe we
   are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her fever
   history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and continues
   whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing to q24hr,
   even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the change in
   dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will recheck levels
   tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to have a positive
   fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been
   positive however even with one positive result fungemia is a concern.
   Pt was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also consult ID
   regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for the positive
   fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in place <24 hours
   since admission and has been d/c
   - am vanc trough was drawn too early
 will recheck random tonight and
   dose tonight is <15 (per ID recs), trough should be cheked 30-60
   minutes prior to dosing , day 1 [**2167-12-28**]

   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.

   - continue vanco and [**Last Name (un) 430**] as above
   #Hypernatremia: at 145 this morning, has been labile even with
   increased free water administration. Her hypernatremia is likely due to
   insensible water losses without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy
   output, or may be a function of NS boluses given to the patient in the
   face of her poor baseline renal function. Will continue to increase her
   free water boluses to as needed and assess response.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, Protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure. 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypernatremia, pneumonia, neck hematoma, left upper extremity swelling, and acute kidney injury (ATN). 

She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. Her blood cultures show sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins, but she has an allergy to beta-lactams. She is receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, and caspofungin. 

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.4 thousand/mm3, decreased hemoglobin (Hct) of 27.9%, elevated platelet count (Plt) of 222 thousand/mm3, and elevated creatinine (Cr) of 2.2 mg/dL. Her sodium level is high at 145 mEq/L. 

The patient has a positive fungal culture from December 23rd, and she has been started on caspofungin. The ID team will be consulted regarding fungemia. 

She has a neck hematoma and left upper extremity swelling, and there is concern for deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter was removed due to the neck hematoma. 

The patient's acute respiratory failure is due to pneumonia caused by E. coli and possibly staph or strep. She is also experiencing pulmonary edema. 

Her hypernatremia is likely due to insensible water losses, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or may be a function of normal saline (NS) boluses given in the face of her poor baseline renal function. 

She has a history of protein C/S deficiency, and her INR is at 1.9. Heparin gtt was held overnight due to the neck hematoma. 

The patient's acute kidney injury is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dL down from 2.2 mg/dL yesterday. 

Her Parkinson's disease is stable, and she is on carbidopa/levodopa and Requip. Her hypertension is stable at 120/50s this morning after Lasix administration.

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 12.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Although her leukocytosis is improving she is still
   continuing to have fevers. She does have broad coverage with Vancomycin
   and Aztreonam however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
t believe we
   are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her fever
   history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and continues
   whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing to q24hr,
   even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the change in
   dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will recheck levels
   tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to have a positive
   fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been
   positive however even with one positive result fungemia is a concern.
   Pt was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also consult ID
   regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for the positive
   fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in place <24 hours
   since admission and has been d/c
   - am vanc trough was drawn too early
 will recheck random tonight and
   dose tonight is <15 (per ID recs), trough should be cheked 30-60
   minutes prior to dosing , day 1 [**2167-12-28**]
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**]
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   - RIJ Catheter Cx pending
   - TTE was without vegatations
   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.
   - CXR appears wet
 will start lasix gtt for gentle diuresis goal -1L
   today
   - after meet I/O goal, will attempt to wean PEEP to 10
   - to discuss trach with family on Thursday at 4am
   #PNA: CXR 2 days ago with b/l basilar infiltrate. E. coli growing from
   sputum (multi-resistant). CXR this morning appears to have
   Unchanged pulmonary edema from yesterday
s x-ray. Given GPCs in the
   sputum, high WBC and fevers, this pneumonia could be due to staph or
   strep, so will continue vancomycin as above. Legionella Ag negative
   - continue vanco and [**Last Name (un) 430**] as above
   #Hypernatremia: at 145 this morning, has been labile even with
   increased free water administration. Her hypernatremia is likely due to
   insensible water losses without replacement, increased hypotonic ostomy
   output, or may be a function of NS boluses given to the patient in the
   face of her poor baseline renal function. Will continue to increase her
   free water boluses to as needed and assess response.
   - free H20 bolus with TF to 200cc q4hrs
   -Continue to trend
 will get pm lytes
   # Neck Hematoma:  Developed in setting of RIJ placement.  No bruits
   - follow
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma
   - will get U/S to r/o DVT
   # Access: R IJ placed yesterday with formation of neck hematoma
   bruits
   - will place A-line today then restart heparin gtt
   #Protein C/S deficiency: INR at 1.9. Heparin gtt held overnight in
   setting of neck hematoma
 LUE appears to be slightly more swollen this
   morning
 concern for DVT given procaogulant state
   - restart heparin gtt after a-line placed
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   #ARF: Improving with Cr of 1.9  down from 2.2 yesterday. Likely ATN
   secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine in setting of gentle diuresis with lasix

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has several ongoing medical complications and concerns:

1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis trending downward, suggesting improvement. She has had fevers and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum. She is sensitive to meropenem, but unfortunately, she has an allergy to beta-lactams. Vancomycin and aztreonam coverage has been provided, but due to low trough levels, the dosing frequency is being changed to q24hr. The goal trough level is 15-20, and rechecking levels will be done tomorrow.

2. Fungemia: The patient had a positive fungal culture from 12/23, but subsequent blood cultures have not been positive. Despite this, fungemia is still a concern, and caspofungin has been started. An infectious disease consultation is pending.

3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with an attempt made to decrease PEEP to 10cmH2O, which resulted in hypertension and a drop in PaO2. The chest X-ray"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, and possible fungemia. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, aztreonam, meropenem, and caspofungin. Her blood cultures show sensitivity to meropenem and cephalosporins, but she has an allergy to beta-lactams. Her sputum culture is positive for MRSA.

The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation. She has had difficulty weaning off the ventilator, and there is concern for pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The family is currently discussing the option of tracheostomy.

The patient's sodium levels are high, indicating hypernatremia. This is likely due to insensible water losses, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or poor renal function. She will continue to receive free water boluses to address this issue.

The patient has developed a neck hematoma in the setting of right internal jugular (RIJ) catheter placement. She has been off heparin due to this complication. There is concern for deep vein"

   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downward at 12.4. Sources previously
   found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She did have 1+
   GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams. Her leukocytosis continues to improve and she has been
   afebrile since becoming therapeutic on her Vancomycin it seems.  MRSA
   screen and sputum cultures now show MRSA +. Will continue Vancomycin
   coverage  and Meropenem Aztreonam for her resistant E. Coli strain.
   Given her low troughs on however given her low trough levels [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]
   believe we are at a therapeutic level yet. It is interesting that her
   fever history appeared to start when her Vancomycin was stopped and
   continues whilst she is sub therapeutic. Will change frequency doseing
   to q24hr, even though he Creatinine Clearance is reduced I believe the
   change in dosing will be needed given her low trough levels. Will
   recheck levels tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20. Pt also noted to
   have a positive fungal culture from [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures
   have not been positive however even with one positive result fungemia
   is a concern. Pt was started on Caspofungin over the weekend, will also
   consult ID regarding fungemia. The only line she has had in place for
   the positive fungal culture was her Right IJ which had only been in
   place <24 hours since admission and has been d/c
   - am vanc trough was drawn too early
 will recheck random tonight and
   dose tonight is <15 (per ID recs), trough should be cheked 30-60

   #Acute Respiratory failure: Current tidal volumes 500 with RR 20, PEEP
   of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to come down
   on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive and
   dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is suggestive of some
   pulmonary edema, given her multiple health issues with her resolving
   sepsis, possible fungemia will not aggressively wean pt today. She will
   need a tracheostomy however given her lack of progress on the
   ventilator, a family discussion is currently underway whether the pt
   would want this.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTEs) off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and possible fungemia. She has an allergy to beta-lactams, which limits the choice of antibiotics. Her leukocytosis is improving, and she has been afebrile since becoming therapeutic on vancomycin. However, her sputum culture shows MRSA, so vancomycin coverage will continue, along with meropenem and aztreonam for resistant E. coli strain.

The patient's low trough levels of vancomycin are concerning, and the frequency of dosing will be changed to q24hr. Rechecking levels tomorrow with a goal trough of 15-20 is planned. The patient also has a positive fungal culture from 12/23, but subsequent blood cultures have not been positive. Fungemia is a concern, and caspofungin has been started. Consultation with ID regarding fungemia is ongoing.

The patient's acute respiratory failure requires close monitoring. Current ventilator settings include tidal volumes of 500, RR 20, PEEP of 15, and FiO2 of 50%. An attempt to lower PEEP to 10cmH20 resulted in hypertension and a drop in PaO2. A tracheostomy is being considered due to lack of progress on the ventilator.

The patient's chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary edema, and she has an ongoing pneumonia with E. coli growing from sputum. The organism is multi-resistant, and vancomycin coverage will be continued. Legionella antigen is negative.

Hypernatremia is present, likely due to insensible water losses, increased hypotonic ostomy output, or poor renal function. Free water boluses will be increased to address this issue.

A neck hematoma developed after the placement of a right internal jugular (RIJ) line. There are no bruits, but the patient is off heparin due to this. Left upper extremity (LUE) swelling is also present, which may indicate deep vein thrombosis (DVT). An ultrasound will be performed to rule out DVT.

The patient's renal function is improving, with a creatinine level of 1.9 down from 2.2 yesterday. This is likely acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to septic shock. Renal function will continue to be monitored during gentle diuresis with lasix gtt.

Other ongoing issues include Parkinson's disease management, hypertension, and hyperkalemia."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with several conditions, including sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypernatremia, MRSA infection, and suspected fungemia. The patient has allergies to beta-lactam antibiotics.

The assessment and plan include continuing vancomycin coverage for MRSA pneumonia, switching to linezolid for increased efficacy against MRSA, continuing meropenem for 14 days, and following up with blood, sputum, and urine cultures. The patient also has a positive fungal culture, and sensitivities for voriconazole and fluconazole have been ordered.

Regarding respiratory failure, the patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 500 mL, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, PEEP of 15 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. An attempt to decrease PEEP to 10 cmH2O was unsuccessful due to hypertension and a drop in PaO2. The chest X-ray still shows some pulmonary edema, so an aggressive diuresis regimen with Las"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, admitted for E. Coli pneumonia and UTI, now showing MRSA in sputum and persistent fevers. She has been tolerating the move to diuresis and PEEP wean with small changes attempted so far, but without durable improvement in oxygenation. She has ongoing poor compliance and continued MRSA culture in sputum. The patient has hypernatremia (high sodium) and sepsis without organ dysfunction.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing acute respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation. There is ongoing poor compliance with the ventilator settings, and the patient's oxygenation has not improved despite attempts at diuresis and PEEP adjustment. Continuous monitoring and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary to prevent further deterioration.

2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, as indicated by persistent fevers and positive cultures for MRSA. This indicates a systemic infection that can lead to organ dysfunction if not effectively managed. Prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics and supportive care are essential to control the infection and prevent complications.

3. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's renal function appears to be impaired, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and decreased urine output. AKI can be a complication of sepsis and may require further evaluation and management, including fluid"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female with history of Parkinson's Disease and Protein C+S
   Deficiency now admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure with
   persistent hypoxemia and volume overload.  She has had some capacity
   for diuresis tolerated only to about 500cc negative.  She has been able
   to maintain adequate oxygenation with decreaed PEEP  but likely
   prolonged course with high risk of recurrent infections and
   complications given persistent critical illlness.
   1)Respiratory Failure--Persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure with
   elevated PEEP requirements--we have effected mild diuresis and been
   able to decrease PEEP to 13 which is a small change.  There is a
   persistent elevation in Ve requirement to 13.  She had PO2=105 with
   PEEP=13.  Will utilize PIP of 28 to guide move to PSV to attempt
   weaning in the setting of persistent high ventilatory and PEEP
   requirements
   -Move to PSV 15/13
   -Look to wean PEEP to 10 today
   -Will decrease PSV as tolerated
   -Mental status remains reasonable in terms of responsiveness but we do
   need to determine cough/gag, etc. to allow consideration of extubation
   which seems unlikely to be effected substantially unless significant
   improvement results
   -Even flulid balance today
   2)Sepsis
GNR in urine and sputum
subsequent development of MRSA in
   sputum and move to Linezolid for better pulmonary penetration so will
   continue with
   Caspofungin #6
   Linezolid #2
   Meropenem #5
   And monitor for possible evolution of fevers
as the persistent low
   grade fevers are of concern.

   Chief Complaint:
   24 Hour Events:
   - She was changed to PS 15/13, however did not tolerate this and had to
   be changed back to CMV/Assist with a PEEP of 13.  Continued to desat to
   the high 80's and her FiO2 was increased to 60%.  Later in the night
   she began desating again and her PEEP was increased to 15.
   - A family meeting was held and the family decided to discuss trach
   placement further and the plan is for another family meeting next
   Monday at 4 pm.  They also decided to reverse her code status and make
   her full code until further dicussion takes place.
   - A lactate was checked and was normal at 0.8.
   - Goal of I/O even - pharmacy will try to concentrate her antibiotics.
   She was started on a low-dose lasix gtt, however she was net positive
   and her SBPs remained in the low 90's the lasix gtt was unable to be
   uptitrated.

   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was started on a trial of
   Pressure Support Ventilation with pressures of 15/13, but failed this
   trial and was converted back to A/C. Current tidal volumes 500 with RR
   20, PEEP of 13, and FiO2 of 50%. Over the week an attempt was made to
   come down on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became hypertensive
   and dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is still suggestive of
   some pulmonary edema even after goal diuresis was met. Will continue an
   aggressive Lasix gtt regimen as BP tolerates and plan to wean in the
   PM. Increased PEEP need may be [**1-4**] the need to increase alveolar
   pressures given the pulmonary edema. If pt is not able to tolerate PEEP
   following diurese will consider other factors for increased PEEP
   requirements.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods, which indicate an ongoing infection. There is also a concern for MRSA and fungal infection. Antibiotic therapy should be adjusted based on culture sensitivities, and close monitoring of vital signs and blood counts is necessary.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation due to pulmonary edema and hypertension. PEEP levels need to be carefully adjusted to prevent further complications, such as barotrauma or hemodynamic instability.
3. Neck Hematoma: The patient developed a neck hematoma in the setting of radial artery catheter placement. Monitoring for signs of expansion or compression of airway structures is crucial.
4. Lower Extremity Swelling: The patient has significant swelling in the left lower extremity, which may be due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or other causes. Ultrasound showed no DVT, but close observation for signs of venous st"

   24 Hour Events:
   Family meeting held--very extensive discussion of what is medically
   possible and what patient would view as minimum acceptable end point
   for this hospitalization.  Her family expressed that living in a
   supported setting but independent to perform her ""crafts"" and
   activities would be her goal.  They were not able to define an
   unacceptable outcome.  We described an expected course of requirement
   for mechanical ventilation chronically and institutionalizaion within
   acute care setting with intermittent tranfers to Rehab being a likely
   outcome at this time.  We agreed to continue with full patient
   treatment at this time and continue to discuss in light of clinical
   progress or worsening over next days.

   73 yo female with history of parkinson's disease now with admission
   with sepsis and respiratory failure now with persistent respiratory
   failure and hypoxemia with drug resistant bacteria and fungemia.  She
   now has worsening hypoxemia which is related to the left lower lobe
   collapse and ongoing hemoptysis and bleeding in the setting of required
   anticoagulation for protein C+S deficeincy.
   1)Respiratory Failure-New issues of significant hemoptysis and left
   lower lobe collapse.  She has persistent hypoxemia in the setting of
   attempt at diuresis-We are left with pneumonia, Collapse, Hemoptysis
   and obesity and chest wall restriction resulting in persistent failure.
   -Bronchoscopy today
   -PIP remain at 31
   -Will have to consider heparin hold if hemoptysis increases and limits
   oxygen as well
   -Will maintain A/C support for now
   -I/O to be even or negative if possible
but CVP is low, blood pressure
   is maginal
   2)Hemoptysis-Likley tracheal trauma in the setting of anticoagulation
   -Will have to define source with bronchoscopy
   -Will hold heparin for now
   -Follow up HCT
   3)Pneumonia-
   -Continue with Linezolid and Meropenem
   -Follow up bronchoscopy samples and will attempt to send protected
   specimen.

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, now admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. She has persistent respiratory failure and hypoxemia due to left lower lobe collapse and ongoing hemoptysis. The patient also has drug-resistant bacteria and fungemia. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is related to issues such as significant hemoptysis, left lower lobe collapse, pneumonia, obesity, and chest wall restriction. These factors may continue to limit her oxygenation and ventilation, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Hemoptysis: The patient's hemoptysis is likely due to tracheal trauma, especially in the setting of anticoagulation. If the bleeding worsens and limits oxygenation, it could lead to respiratory distress or failure.
3. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, which is being treated with antibiotics (Linezolid and Meropenem). However, if the infection does not respond to treatment or if the patient develops complications such as abscess formation or septic emboli, it could lead to worsening respiratory failure.
4. Sepsis: The patient has sepsis without organ dysfunction, which is being treated with antibiotics (Linezolid and Meropenem) and antifungal medication (Casopfungin). If the infection is not adequately controlled, the patient's condition could deteriorate, leading to septic shock and multiple"

   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She
   did have 1+ GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows
   sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately

   failed this trial and was converted back to A/C. Current tidal volumes
   500 with RR 20, PEEP of 15, and FiO2 of 60%. Over the week an attempt
   was made to come down on her PEEP to 10cmH20, unfortunately she became
   hypertensive and dropped her Pa02 on ABG. Her chest x-ray is still
   suggestive of  some pulmonary edema even after goal diuresis was met..
   Increased PEEP need may be [**1-4**] the need to increase alveolar pressures
   given the pulmonary edema. If pt is not able to tolerate PEEP following
   diurese will consider other factors for increased PEEP requirements.
   Bronchoscopy today revealed copious secretions in the left lung, trauma
   to the upper airways, but no evidence of active bleeding in the lower
   airways. Trauma likely due to repeated suctioning.
   - Will decrease suction pressures and limit the amount of suctioning

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/s deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS), hypernatremia, anemia, left upper extremity swelling, protein C/s deficiency, acute renal failure (ATN secondary to septic shock), Parkinson's disease, neck hematoma, hypertension, and hypothyroidism.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 123/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and a heart rhythm of sinus rhythm. Her current medication regimen includes fentanyl, midazolam, heparin, Lasix, meropenem, caspofungin, and linezolid.

The patient's recent lab results show leukocytosis trending downwards at 11,000 cells/mm³, hemoglobin concentration of 7.4 g/dL, sodium level of 142 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL, and a blood glucose level of 135 mg/dL.

The patient's imaging studies reveal pulmonary edema on chest X-ray, and her bronchoscopy showed copious secretions in the left lung, trauma to the upper airways, but no evidence of active bleeding in the lower airways.

The patient's plan includes continuing linezolid for MRSA pneumonia coverage, meropenem for Gram-negative coverage, and caspofungin for fungal infection. The team will also trend temperature and WBC count, follow up with blood, sputum, and urine cultures, and consider other factors for increased PEEP requirements. The patient's Hct drop from 25.3 to 22.4 over 24 hours is concerning for hemorrhage, and the team will type and screen for packed red blood cells (pRBC) transfusion."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events, chronic kidney disease, and a partial colectomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has shown improvement in her respiratory status. However, she continues to have difficulty weaning off the ventilator due to pulmonary edema and hypertension.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including hypernatremia, sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury. She has an allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics and is sensitive to meropenem. The patient's sputum culture showed MRSA positivity, and she is currently being treated with linezolid, meropenem, and caspofungin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, and there is a concern about her ability to tolerate weaning from mechanical ventilation. Factors such as pulmonary edema and hypertension may contribute to increased alveolar pressures.
2. Sepsis: Although the patient is currently on appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is a risk of ongoing infection and sepsis. Monitoring for signs of worsening infection or septic shock is important.
3. Acute kidney injury: The patient has evidence of acute kidney injury, likely secondary to septic shock. Close monitoring of renal function and"

   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downwards at 11 today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She
   did have 1+ GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows
   sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately
   has an allergy to beta lactams.  MRSA screen and sputum cultures now
   show MRSA +.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off
   yesterday. Sensitivities fort Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been
   ordered will f/u.
   - Appreciate ID recs, recommended switching to Linezolid for MRSA PNA
   coverage rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.
   Continue linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA

   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a
   PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of secretions
   and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP dependance may be
   due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs. Unfortunately
   even though suctioning would aid with secretion removal it would likely
   worsen the blding providing more trauma. Will thus try instilling
   normal saline and suctioning from within the ventilator tube system
   once the pt is able to cough up the secretions.
   - Instill NS into tube to induce cough, suction only winthin the
   confines of the ventilator tubing
   - CXR appears wet
 continue lasix as necessary. Goal = even to -500cc
   - Holding heparin gtt to reduce risk of bleeding s/p repeated traumas
   # Anemia: Hct has remained stable at 22. Will continue to monitor Hct.
    - Type and screen pRBC and transfuse as necessary. Goal Hct > 21.
   - Holding heparin gtt for now.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness this morning will re-order
   an U/S for DVT.

   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip being held.

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/s deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypernatremia, and anemia. She has allergies to beta-lactams and is currently on multiple antibiotics for MRSA, Gram-negative rods, and fungal coverage. Her current medications include fentanyl, midazolam, and lasix infusions, as well as oral fibersource HN nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical, and there is a concern about PEEP dependence due to secretions in her lungs. There is also a risk of worsening bleeding from the recent bronchoscopy.

2. Sepsis: The patient has ongoing infections, including MRSA, Gram-negative rods, and possible fungemia. She requires continuous monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels, which need to be managed through careful fluid balance and possibly diuretics.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct has remained stable at 22%, indicating ongoing blood loss or inadequate production of red blood cells. Regular monitoring and possible transfusion may"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of pulmonary disease, protein C/S deficiency, and an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The patient was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis caused by ESBL-producing bacteria, MRSA, and globe bacteria. The patient's current condition is critical, and she remains ventilator-dependent with high PEEP and FiO2 requirements. 

The patient has experienced several complications since admission. She underwent a bronchoscopy, which resulted in bleeding due to suction trauma. As a result, heparin was stopped, and the patient tolerated a decrease in PEEP to 8 after the bronchoscopic procedure. The patient's family meeting was held, and it was decided to change the code status to full code.

The patient has received multiple antibiotics including vancomycin, caspofungin, linezolid, and meropenem. She is also on infusions of midazolam (versed) and furosemide (Lasix). Other medications include fentanyl, lansoprazole, Equip, carbidopa/levodopa, zoloft, colace, and free water.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 123/47 mmHg to 148/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and"

   73 y/o Female with PMH of Parkinson
s dz, Protein C/S deficiency,
   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downwards at 11 today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She
   did have 1+ GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows
   sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately
   has an allergy to beta lactams.  MRSA screen and sputum cultures now
   show MRSA +.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off
   yesterday. Sensitivities fort Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been
   ordered will f/u.
   - Appreciate ID recs, recommended switching to Linezolid for MRSA PNA
   coverage rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.
   Continue linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**]

   sensitivities
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Sputum from bronchoscopy sent today
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a
   PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of secretions
   and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP dependance may be
   due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs. Unfortunately
   even though suctioning would aid with secretion removal it would likely
   worsen the blding providing more trauma. Will thus try instilling
   normal saline and suctioning from within the ventilator tube system
   once the pt is able to cough up the secretions.
   - Instill NS into tube to induce cough, suction only winthin the
   confines of the ventilator tubing
   - CXR appears wet
 continue lasix as necessary. Goal = even to -500cc
   - Holding heparin gtt to reduce risk of bleeding s/p repeated traumas
   # Anemia: Hct has remained stable at 22. Will continue to monitor Hct.
    - Type and screen pRBC and transfuse as necessary. Goal Hct > 21.
   - Holding heparin gtt for now.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness this morning will re-order
   an U/S for DVT.
   - U/S to check for  DVT
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip being held.
    - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   -  Holding heparin given current tracheal bld
   -  Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure.

The patient has been experiencing several medical complications:

1. Arterial line stop: The arterial line stopped at 10:00 AM, indicating a possible issue with the line or the patient's blood flow.

2. Aspiration risk: The patient appeared to aspirate during lunch, which led to being made NPO (nothing by mouth) and placed on mechanical ventilation (MIVF). This suggests that the patient may have difficulty swallowing or is at risk of aspiration pneumonia.

3. Hypotension: The patient's systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased to the 80s, resulting in decreased urine output. The patient received intravenous fluids (IVF) with minimal response and was restarted on pressor support. This indicates potential septic shock or inadequate perfusion.

4. Fever: The patient had a fever of 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, prompting panculturing to identify the source of infection.

5. Acute hypoxia: The patient became acutely hypoxic with desaturation to the low 80s, necessitating placement on a non"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downwards at 11 today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, but She
   did have 1+ GPC in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows
   sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately
   has an allergy to beta lactams.  MRSA screen and sputum cultures now
   show MRSA +.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off
   yesterday. Sensitivities fort Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been
   ordered will f/u.
   - Appreciate ID recs, recommended switching to Linezolid for MRSA PNA
   coverage rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.
   Continue linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**]

   sensitivities
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Sputum from bronchoscopy sent today
   - Follow up blood, sputum, and urine cultures
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a
   PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of secretions
   and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP dependance may be
   due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs. Unfortunately
   even though suctioning would aid with secretion removal it would likely
   worsen the blding providing more trauma. Will thus try instilling
   normal saline and suctioning from within the ventilator tube system
   once the pt is able to cough up the secretions.
   - Instill NS into tube to induce cough, suction only winthin the
   confines of the ventilator tubing
   - CXR appears wet
 continue lasix as necessary. Goal = even to -500cc
   - Holding heparin gtt to reduce risk of bleeding s/p repeated traumas
   # Anemia: Hct has remained stable at 22. Will continue to monitor Hct.
    - Type and screen pRBC and transfuse as necessary. Goal Hct > 21.
   - Holding heparin gtt for now.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness this morning will re-order
   an U/S for DVT.
   - U/S to check for  DVT
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip being held.
    - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   -  Holding heparin given current tracheal bld
   -  Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #ARF: Improving with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0.
   Pt likely had ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple VTEs, chronic kidney disease, and partial colectomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been experiencing several episodes of desaturation in the mid-80s, which improve with mobilization of secretions. Her PEEP was increased from 8 to 10 during rounds. She has a positive fungal culture from 12/23, but subsequent blood cultures have not been positive. The patient has allergies to beta-lactams and is currently on multiple antibiotics, including caspofungin, meropenem, and linezolid. She also has anemia, left upper extremity swelling, and a history of protein C/S deficiency.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. There is concern about the amount of secretions in her lungs, which may be contributing to her dependence on PEEP. The wet chest X-ray indicates ongoing lung congestion.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, and there are multiple positive cultures indicating a possible fungal and bacterial infection. The patient has been started on antifungal medication (caspofungin) and is also receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics (meropenem and linezolid).
3. Anemia: The patient"

","The patient is a 73-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a history of partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure, unable to be weaned off the ventilator.

The patient has several potential medical complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis trending downwards and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum, as well as MRSA in her sputum. She is allergic to beta-lactam antibiotics and has a positive fungal culture from December 23rd, but subsequent blood cultures have not been positive. The patient is being treated with caspofungin, linezolid, and meropenem.
2. Acute respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a PEEP of 8 after bronchoscopy, but remains dependent on the ventilator due to secretions. She will continue to receive normal saline instillations and suctioning within the ventilator tubing.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased to 9.6 g/dL, likely due to bleeding in her trachea during bronchoscopy. She will be transfused with packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her post"

She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure and remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's recent events include experiencing several episodes of desaturation in the mid-80s, which improve with mobilization of secretions. She has also had a bronchoscopy that showed mucous plugging. Her line was changed due to poor waveform, and there is concern for increased swelling in her left upper extremity (LUE), for which an ultrasound (US) has been ordered.

The patient has allergies to morphine, aspirin, cephalosporins, and unknown medications. She has been receiving multiple infusions, including fentanyl, midazolam, and furosemide. Her current medications include linezolid, meropenem, and caspofungin.

Lab results show leukocytosis trending downwards, with previous cultures showing Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA in sputum. The patient has a positive fungal culture from 12/23, but subsequent blood cultures have not been positive. She has been started on caspofungin, and sensitivities for voriconazole and fluconazole have"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downwards at 9.6 today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off.
   Sensitivities fort Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch two days ago showed
   mucous plugging.
   - Appreciate ID recs, recommended switching to Linezolid for MRSA PNA
   coverage rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.
   Continue linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day
   [**4-14**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**6-14**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day [**8-15**].
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a
   PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of secretions
   and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP dependance may be
   due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs. Unfortunately
   even though suctioning would aid with secretion removal it would likely
   worsen the blding providing more trauma. Will continue instilling
   normal saline and suctioning from within the ventilator tube system if
   she appears to have mucous plugging.
   - Will continue current ventilatory support for today and hold off
   weaning attempts.
   - Instill NS into tube to induce cough, suction only winthin the
   confines of the ventilator tubing
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt. Goal = even to -500cc
   - Holding heparin gtt to reduce risk of bleeding s/p repeated traumas
   - Treatment of infection as above.
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1.  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch two days ago
   - Type and screen pRBC and transfuse as necessary.
   - Will transfuse 1 unit PRBC this am and check a post transfusion Hct.
   - Holding heparin gtt for now.
   - Guaiac stool.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness this morning will re-order
   an U/S for DVT.
   - U/S to check for  DVT
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip being held.
    - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   -  Holding heparin given current tracheal bld
   -  Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) without anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with MRSA pneumonia, fungal infection in the blood, and acute respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already diagnosed with sepsis due to a fungal infection in the blood and MRSA pneumonia. It is important to continue treatment with appropriate antibiotics and antifungal medication.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Bronchoscopic interventions may be required to clear secretions and mucous plugging.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration has decreased to 21.1, indicating anemia. The bleeding in the trachea observed during bronchoscopy might be the cause. Transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may be needed to correct the anemia.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has swelling in the left upper extremity (LUE) with erythema and tenderness. This could indicate the development of DVT. Further evaluation with an ultrasound for D"

   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was able to be weaned down to a
   PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of secretions
   and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP dependance may be
   due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs. Unfortunately
   even though suctioning would aid with secretion removal it would likely
   worsen the blding providing more trauma. Will continue instilling
   normal saline and suctioning from within the ventilator tube system if
   she appears to have mucous plugging.
   - Will continue current ventilatory support for today and hold off
   weaning attempts.
   - Instill NS into tube to induce cough, suction only winthin the
   confines of the ventilator tubing
   - Continue diuresis with Lasix gtt. Goal = even to -500cc
   - Holding heparin gtt to reduce risk of bleeding s/p repeated traumas
   - Treatment of infection as below
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis trending downwards at 8.8 today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off.
   Sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch 3 days ago showed mucous
   plugging.
   - Appreciate ID recs, recommended switching to Linezolid for MRSA PNA
   coverage rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.
   Continue linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day
   [**5-15**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**7-15**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day [**9-14**].
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1 on [**1-4**].  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch 3 days ago, now stabilized.  S/p
   1u PRBC.
   - Trend Hct
   - Holding heparin gtt for now.
   - Guaiac stool.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness, ordered U/S for DVT.
   Prelim read neg for DVT.
   - f/u final read of U/S to check for  DVT
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip being held.
    - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   -  Holding heparin given current tracheal bld
   -  Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine

   respiratory failure.  She did have initial insult with both likely
   pneumonia and fungemia
   1)Respiratory Failure-patient has had excellent diuresis with Lasic
   gtt, however with continued high levels of PEEP required and will have
   to move to tracheostomy with continued long term weaning.
   -The decrease in PEEP not being tolerated is likely related to
   persistent dependent atelactasis
   -There may be a lesser issue of persistent volume overload and will
   need to be continued with diuresis
   -If persistent failure seen will need to continue to provide long term
   support with tracheostomy
   -No evidence of further hemoptysis
   -ETT bleeding diminished
will return to Heparin IV when bleeding
   stabilized
   -Will move to Bronchoscopy today.

   73 yo female with history of PD and admit with poly-microbial resistant
   E. Coli in lung and urine now with sepsis resolving but faced with
   persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure despite continued efforts at
   diuresis and continued antibiotics.  She did have requirement for
   increase in FIO2 and PEEP with ABG showing stability of oxygenation
   only with increased support.  Renal function remains favorable.
   1)Respiratory Failure-Clearly needs continued diuresis and good
   pulmonary toilet.  Minimal evidence of any further bleeding noted on
   suctioning.
   -Lasix gtt at 4mg/hr
   -Continue with PEEP at 12-15
   -Will need to mobilize patient a possible to hope to move to extubation
   -Check NIF today to evaluate motor strenth
   -Trial PSV today with 12/15
   -Return to elevated PEEP of 15 today to work to maintain lung patency
   -Doubt extrapulmonary shunt but is possible.
   -Bronchoscopy for evaluation of persistent secretions if collapse seen
   -No evidence of persistent bleeding and will return to Heparin IV today
   -Will trial recruitment today to look to return to adequate oxygenation

","Summary of the Progress Note:

- The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease and admission with polymicrobial resistant E. Coli in the lung and urine. She is currently experiencing sepsis but has shown improvement in her condition.
- The patient is facing persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure despite continued efforts at diuresis and antibiotics.
- She requires an increased FiO2 and PEEP with ABG showing stability of oxygenation only with increased support.
- The patient's renal function remains favorable.
- The patient has a history of hypernatremia (high sodium), sepsis without organ dysfunction, and respiratory failure.
- The patient is currently on ICU care, including nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.
- The patient has a code status of DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing persistent hypoxemic respiratory failure despite continued efforts. This can lead to further deterioration in oxygenation and potential complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

2. Sepsis: Although the patient's sepsis is resolving, there is still a risk of recurrence or progression of infection. This can lead to systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a history of hypernatremia, which is an abnormally high level of sodium"

s dz, Protein C/S deficiency,
   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was initially able to be weaned
   down to a PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of
   secretions and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP
   dependance may be due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs.
   On [**2168-1-5**] overnight, patient desatted to 90% on vent and required
   increase of PEEP from 10 to 12 and FiO2 increase to 70% from 60%.
   Recruitment maneuvers and repositioning unsuccessful.  Possible
   etiologies for worsening hypoxia include atelectasis, CHF, and PE.
   - empiric anticoagulation with heparin gtt for possible PE
   - Will attempt recruitment maneuvers today with goal of decreasing FiO2
   - CVP and renal function normal so will continue with gentle diuresis
   with lasix gtt with goal of even to -500cc
   - suctioning as needed for mucous plugging
   - Treatment of infection as below
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis and now trending downwards today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off.
   Sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch on [**1-2**] showed mucous
   plugging.  Also had low grade temps on [**1-5**].
   - Appreciate ID reccs, have switched to Linezolid for MRSA PNA coverage
   rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.   Continue
   linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day [**6-14**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**8-15**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day [**10-15**].
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1 on [**1-4**].  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch, now stabilized.  S/p 1u PRBC on
   [**1-3**].
   - Trend Hct
   - restarting heparin gtt
   - Guaiac stool.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness, ordered U/S for DVT.
   However, nevative for PE.
   - warfarm compresses to extremities
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip held.  Hct stable now and will restart anticoagulation
   with hep gtt for empiric tx of PE.
   - heparin gtt
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   -  Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine
   #Parkinson

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) events, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure, but was unable to be weaned off the ventilator.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/55 mmHg to 91/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range, indicating adequate fluid status.

The patient has several medical complications that require attention. Firstly, the patient has acute respiratory failure, which is likely due to atelectasis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pulmonary embolism (PE). The treatment plan includes increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to 70%, performing recruitment maneuvers, and considering empiric anticoagulation for possible PE.

Secondly, the patient has sepsis, as indicated by leukocytosis and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in her sput"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 y/o Female with PMH of Parkinson
s dz, Protein C/S deficiency,
   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was initially able to be weaned
   down to a PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of
   secretions and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP
   dependance may be due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs.
   On [**2168-1-5**] overnight, patient desatted to 90% on vent and required
   increase of PEEP from 10 to 12 and FiO2 increase to 70% from 60%.
   Recruitment maneuvers and repositioning unsuccessful.  Possible
   etiologies for worsening hypoxia include atelectasis, CHF, and PE.
   - empiric anticoagulation with heparin gtt for possible PE
   - Will attempt recruitment maneuvers today with goal of decreasing FiO2
   - CVP and renal function normal so will continue with gentle diuresis
   with lasix gtt with goal of even to -500cc
   - suctioning as needed for mucous plugging
   -Treatment of infection as below
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis and now trending downwards today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and is and signed off.
   Sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch on [**1-2**] showed mucous
   plugging.  Also had low grade temps on [**1-5**].
   - Appreciate ID reccs, have switched to Linezolid for MRSA PNA coverage
   rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.   Continue
   linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day [**6-14**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**8-15**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day [**10-15**].
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1 on [**1-4**].  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch, now stabilized.  S/p 1u PRBC on
   [**1-3**].
   - Trend Hct
   - restarting heparin gtt
   - Guaiac stool.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness, ordered U/S for DVT.
   However, nevative for PE.
   - warfarm compresses to extremities
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip held.  Hct stable now and will restart anticoagulation
   with hep gtt for empiric tx of PE.
   - heparin gtt
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   - Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine
   #Parkinson
s Disease: Stable. Continue carbidopa/levodopa and Requip
   #HTN: Stable this morning will continue Lasix gtt
   -Continue monitoring. Goal fluid balance for day = even or -500cc

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, Protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure and is currently intubated on assist-control ventilation with PEEP at 18 cmH2O and FiO2 at 40%.

Over the past 24 hours, the patient underwent recruitment maneuvers with unclear benefit, was weaned from furosemide drip due to potential hypotension, and had an increase in hepatic gtt for protein C/S deficiency. Her allergies include morphine, aspirin, cephalosporins, and unknown allergies. The last doses of antibiotics administered were caspofungin, meropenem, and linezolid.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 93/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has a central venous pressure (CVP) of 7 mmHg, total fluid intake of 3127 mL, and total fluid output of 2218 mL. Blood products have been transfused with a total output of 2240 mL.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 194 K/uL, hyponatremia with an Na+ level of 27 mEq/L, elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at 126 mg/dL, creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 221,000/mm³. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's PEEP dependence may be due to secretions in her lungs. She desaturated to 90% on vent overnight and required an increase in PEEP from 10 to 12 and FiO2 to 70%. Recruitment maneuvers and repositioning were unsuccessful. Possible etiologies for worsening hypoxia include atelectasis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been put on 18 cmH2O PEEP with improvement in CXR clarity and reduction in FiO2. She will continue with gentle diuresis, suctioning for mucous plugging, and treatment for infection as below.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and trending downwards today. Sources previously found to be Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to meropenem, zos"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a medical history of Parkinson's disease, Protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolisms (VTE) off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was admitted to the ICU for septic shock and respiratory failure and has been on mechanical ventilation. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including anemia, left upper extremity swelling, protein C/S deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, Parkinson's disease, and hypertension. She is currently receiving multiple medications for various conditions, including antifungals, antibiotics, anticoagulants, and antihypertensives. The patient's recent progress includes improvement in respiratory status, resolution of sepsis, and stabilization of her hemodynamic status. However, she continues to have ongoing challenges related to her respiratory failure, infection, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to atelectasis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pulmonary embolism (PE). She requires close monitoring and intervention to improve oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Infection: The patient has a positive fungal culture and sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered. She is currently on Caspofungin, and ID was consulted and approved the treatment. Additionally, she has an ongoing bacterial infection, and her sputum culture shows sensitivity to meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. However, she has an allergy to beta-lactams. The treatment plan includes Linezolid for MRSA PNA coverage and meropenem for 14 days. Close monitoring and follow-up blood cultures are necessary.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, indicating anemia. She had bleeding in her trachea during bronchoscopy and received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC). The cause of anemia needs further evaluation, and the patient's Hct should be trended regularly.
4. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: The patient has swelling in her left upper extremity with erythema and tenderness. An ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) has been ordered due to worsening edema. The patient has a history of protein C/S deficiency and has been off heparin gtt in the setting of a neck hematoma. Close monitoring and appropriate intervention are required.
5. Protein C/S Deficiency: The patient has protein C/S deficiency and was on coumadin as an outpatient. She was also on a heparin gtt due to recent procedures. The heparin drip was held due to a 3-point drop in hematocrit, but her Hct is now stable. She will restart anticoagulation with hep gtt for empiric"

   Assessment and Plan
   73 yo female admit with E. Coli sepsis with cultures positive from lung
   and urine.  She has had prolonged course of intubation with persistent
   hypoxemia secondary to volume overload and atelectasis.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Will evaluate for possible effusions as contributor to persistent
   failure
   -Will move to ventilator weaning in PSV mode with start from elevated
   PEEP
   -FIO2 to remain at 0.4
   -Will provide bronchoscopy for clearance of secretions in LLL which may
   be preventing re-expansion to allow optimization
   -Rapid wean following bronch and optimization of PEEP and oxygenation

   73 y/o Female with PMH of Parkinson
s dz, Protein C/S deficiency,
   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was initially able to be weaned
   down to a PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of
   secretions and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP
   dependance may be due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs.
   On [**2168-1-5**] overnight, patient desatted to 90% on vent and required
   increase of PEEP from 10 to 12 and FiO2 increase to 70% from 60%.
   Recruitment maneuvers and repositioning unsuccessful.  Possible
   etiologies for worsening hypoxia include atelectasis, CHF, and PE.   On
   [**2168-1-5**], put on 18 PEEP with improvement in clarity of CXR and reduction
   in FiO2.
   - continue empiric anticoagulation with heparin gtt for possible PE
   - Will attempt PS on [**2167-12-7**] with plan for rapid extubation
   - bronchoscopy today to help clear any mucous plugging that may be
   causing LLL collapse
   - CVP and renal function normal so will continue with gentle diuresis
   with lasix gtt with goal of even to -500cc
   - suctioning as needed for mucous plugging
   - Treatment of infection as below
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis and now trending downwards today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and and signed off.
   Sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch on [**1-2**] showed mucous
   plugging.  Also had low grade temps on [**2168-1-5**].
   - Appreciate ID reccs, have switched to Linezolid for MRSA PNA coverage
   rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.   Continue
   linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day [**7-15**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**9-14**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day [**11-14**].
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1 on [**1-4**].  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch, now stabilized.  S/p 1u PRBC on
   [**1-3**].  Restarted hep gtt on [**2167-12-5**] for ?PE but hct stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - cont heparin gtt
   - Guaiac stool.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness, ordered U/S for DVT.
   However, nevative for PE.
   - warfarm compresses to extremities
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip held.  Hct stable now and will restart anticoagulation
   with hep gtt for empiric tx of PE.
   - heparin gtt
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   - Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine
   #Parkinson

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolism (VTE) episodes off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. The patient was transferred to the ICU for further management of septic shock and respiratory failure after experiencing a partial colectomy with ostomy.

The patient's current condition includes acute respiratory failure, sepsis, anemia, left upper extremity swelling, protein C/S deficiency, chronic renal insufficiency, Parkinson's disease, and hypertension. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening hypoxia due to atelectasis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as ongoing infections such as MRSA pneumonia and fungal infection. The patient also has a history of bleeding in the trachea, and there are concerns about possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension need to be managed.

Overall, the patient's medical condition is complex, and close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further complications."

   73 y/o Female with PMH of Parkinson
s dz, Protein C/S deficiency,
   Multiple VTE off anticoag [**1-4**] RP hematoma wit IVC filter, CKD, s/p
   partieal colectomy with ostomy transferred to [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further
   management of septic shock and respiratory failure unable to be weaned
   off the vent.
   #Acute Respiratory failure: The patient was initially able to be weaned
   down to a PEEP of 8 following the bronchoscopy. Given the amount of
   secretions and blood suctioned from the bronchoscopy pt
s PEEP
   dependance may be due to the amount of secretions she has in her lungs.
   On [**2168-1-5**] overnight, patient desatted to 90% on vent and required
   increase of PEEP from 10 to 12 and FiO2 increase to 70% from 60%.
   Recruitment maneuvers and repositioning unsuccessful.  Possible
   etiologies for worsening hypoxia include atelectasis, CHF, and PE.   On
   [**2168-1-5**], put on 18 PEEP with improvement in clarity of CXR and reduction
   in FiO2.
   - continue empiric anticoagulation with heparin gtt for possible PE
   - Will attempt PS on [**2168-1-7**] with plan for rapid extubation if tolerated
   after discussing with family
   - bronchoscopy today to help clear any mucous plugging that may be
   causing LLL collapse
   - CVP and renal function normal so will continue with gentle diuresis
   with lasix gtt with goal of even to -500cc
   - suctioning as needed for mucous plugging
   - Treatment of infection as below
   # Sepsis: Leukocytosis and now trending downwards today. Sources
   previously found to be Gram negative rods in urine and sputum, and MRSA
   in her sputum. Sputum culture sensitivity shows sensitivity to
   meropenem, zosyn, and cephalosporins. Pt unfortunately has an allergy
   to beta lactams.  Pt also noted to have a positive fungal culture from
   [**12-23**], her subsequent bld cultures have not been positive however even
   with one positive result fungemia is a concern. Pt was started on
   Caspofungin over the weekend, ID was consulted and and signed off.
   Sensitivities for Voriconazole and Fluconazole have been ordered will
   f/u.  Recent sputum cx with no growth.  Bronch on [**1-2**] showed mucous
   plugging.  Also had low grade temps on [**2168-1-5**].
   - Appreciate ID reccs, have switched to Linezolid for MRSA PNA coverage
   rather than Vancomycin given it
s increased efficacy.   Continue
   linezolid for 14 days for MRSA PNA
 day 1- [**2167-12-30**], now day [**8-15**].
   - continue meropenem for 14 days
 day 1 [**2167-12-28**], now day [**10-15**].
   - continue caspofungin for [**Female First Name (un) 188**] in blood
 day 1 [**2167-12-26**], f/u
   sensitivities, now day 13/14.
   - Trend temp and WBC
   - Follow up blood cultures
   # Anemia: Hct decreased today to 21.1 on [**1-4**].  Patient was seen to have
   bleeding in her trachea on the bronch, now stabilized.  S/p 1u PRBC on
   [**1-3**].  Restarted hep gtt on [**2167-12-5**] for ?PE but hct stable.
   - Trend Hct
   - cont heparin gtt
   - Guaiac stool.
   # Hypokalemia:  will recheck potassium in p.m.
   # LUE Swelling:  L >R, has anasraca so difficult to assess. Has been
   off heparin gtt in setting of neck hematoma. U/S several days agi was
   noted to be negative, however given the worsening of edema one the left
   side as well as the erythema and tenderness, ordered U/S for DVT.
   However, nevative for PE.
   - warm compresses to extremities
   #Protein C/S deficiency: Patient on coumadin as an outpatient, was on a
   heprin gtt due to recent procedures. Due to 3 point drop in hematocrit,
   heparin drip held.  Hct stable now and will restart anticoagulation
   with hep gtt for empiric tx of PE.
   - heparin gtt
   - Continue to hold coumadin pending discussion of trach given
   aspiration risk
   - Will monitor PT, PTT, and INR q day
   #Chronic renal insufficiency: Patient had ARF initially, now improved
   with Cr of 1.6 lower than her reported baseline of 2.0. Pt likely had
   ATN secondary to septic shock. Baseline of ~2 per records.
   -Continue trending creatinine

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease, protein C/S deficiency, multiple venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) off anticoagulation, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a partial colectomy with ostomy. She was transferred to the ICU for management of septic shock and respiratory failure, unable to be weaned off the ventilator.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing difficulty weaning off the ventilator, which may be due to atelectasis, congestive heart failure (CHF), or pulmonary embolism (PE). She has had improvements in her oxygen saturation levels after increasing PEEP and FiO2. Further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her respiratory failure.

2. Sepsis: The patient has leukocytosis and positive cultures for Gram-negative rods in urine and sputum, as well as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in her sputum. She is currently on multiple antibiotics, including meropenem, linezolid, and caspofungin for fungal coverage. Close monitoring and follow-up of blood cultures are necessary to ensure appropriate treatment.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level has decreased, indicating anemia. She received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) due to bleeding in her trachea"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old female with a history of Parkinson's disease who is currently in the ICU. She is experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, and has a high sodium level (hypernatremia). She is being treated with antibiotics and has undergone a bronchoscopy to clear secretions. Her renal function remains stable with a negative fluid balance. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with prolonged elevated PEEP and has shown improved oxygenation. The plan is to wean her off the ventilator using pressure support ventilation (PSV) and then gradually reduce the PEEP to 5 if she can maintain adequate oxygenation. She also has Parkinson's disease and will continue on Sinemet and ropinirole. Additionally, she has a protein C and S deficiency and will return to IV heparin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypernatremia: This is indicated by the high sodium level in the blood. It can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and neurological symptoms if not managed properly.
2. Sepsis without organ dysfunction: Although the patient's sepsis is being treated with antibiotics, there is still a risk of complications such as infection spread, organ failure, or systemic inflammation.
3. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires close monitoring and careful weaning from mechanical ventilation to avoid complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or barotrauma.
4. Protein C and S deficiency: This deficiency"
