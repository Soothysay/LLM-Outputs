   Assessment and Plan
   ALTERED MENTAL STATUS -- attributed predominately to subdural hematoma,
   and active infection (urinary source).  Also consider seizure and
   post-ictal state.  Underlying abnormal brain function due to strokes
   and Biswengers.  Continue neurology checks.  EEG.
   SUBDURAL HEMATOMA -- left acute subdural hematoma by CT.  Neurorsurgery
   following.  Continue anticonvulsant (dilantin --> follow level)
   ANEMIA -- chronic, perhaps recent worsening following trauma.
   FLUIDS -- provide iv fluid bolus.
   NUTITIONAL SUPPORT -- remain NPO while dysarthric.  Begin PO once
   mental status improves.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with an altered mental status. The patient's condition is attributed to a subdural hematoma, active infection (urinary source), potential seizure, and post-ictal state. Underlying abnormal brain function is likely due to strokes and Biswengers. Neurology checks should continue, and an EEG should be performed.

The patient also has a left acute subdural hematoma, as confirmed by CT scan. Neurosurgery is recommended following this. The patient may have chronic anemia, possibly worsening recently after trauma. IV fluid bolus should be provided. The patient should remain NPO (nothing by mouth) due to dysarthria, but nutritional support can be initiated once mental status improves.

Additionally, the patient has a left clavicle fracture, for which pain control measures should be implemented. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of the subdural hematoma leading to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration. The urinary tract infection may progress to a systemic infection or sepsis. The patient's chronic anemia could worsen, leading to further complications."

   Assessment and Plan
   67 y.o. M with history of TIA's and Binswanger's disease recently
   discharged s/p fall p/w with AMS of one day's duration, with +UTI, ?PNA
   and e/o acute on chronic SDH.
   .
   # AMS: Likely multifactorial.  Patient with underlying Binswanger's
   disease, TIAs and chronic SDH.  Also with new UTI, ?PNA in left
   retrocardiac space, and acute SDH.  Also discharged with Percocet for
   pain relief which may be worsening overall process.  With question of
   PNA, patient did have chest tube on prior admission with effusion in
   that area and atelectasis (s/p so could be [**2-11**] to those processes).
   Also, given ICH, could be having occult seizure.
   - Per NS recs: Stop Aggrenox, 6 pack platelets, Re-check CT in AM, and
   re-check stat CT if neurological decline, treat infection/s with
   rocephin or levoflox, continue Dilantin 100 TID and check level in AM,
   consider MRI to r/o new infarct if mental status not improving
   after treatment of infection, consider routine EEG tomorrow if mental
   status not improving
   - Will treat UTI/PNA with Zosyn
   - d/c Flagyl unless e/o cavitary lesion on CXR
   - Follow-up blood/urine cultures at BIDN
   - Repeat UA/blood culture here
   - Q2H neuro checks
   - EEG in AM, Dilantin in interim
   - CT head in AM to r/o evolution or worsening
   - Hold narcotic medications
   - Transfuse platelets given Aggrenox
   - Monitor for e/o sepsis
   .
   # SDH: As above.  NS aware and following.  Will implement
   recommendations as pertinent.
   - CT head in AM for stability
   - Transfuse platelets now
   .
   # S/p fall with multiple fractures: On last hospitalization, pain
   management was an issue.  Will hold narcotics given AMS.
   - Hold narcotics
   - Consider lidoderm patch on L flank for rib pain
   .
   # O2 requirement: 99/2L.  Could be [**2-11**] to PNA.  Will attempt to wean to
   RA and further evaluate if unable.
   .
   # Dysphagia:  On last admission, apparently many issues with concern
   for aspiration.  Did consider Dobhoff vs. PEG.  Pt ultimately did pass
   S&S evaluation.  Given AMS, will hold PO nutrition.
   - NPO for AMS and aspiration risk.
   .
   # Binswanger's disease/Progressive neurological deterioration: On last
   admission given the patient's fall and concern for an increased tempo
   of the patient's illness he was evaluated by the inpatient
   neurology consult team.  They recommended continuing his outpatient
   regimen and further work-up of lumbar mass per below.
   - Hold outpatient medications while NPO
   - restart once MS clears
   .
   # Lumbar mass: Patient has a lumbar mass found incidentally on MRI
   L-spine to evaluate new bowel and bladder symptoms in [**Month (only) **].  The
   etiology of this is unknown.  To have LP as outpatient.
   - Defer to outpatient
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Not an active issue.
   - Atorvastatin once no longer NPO
   .
   # Depression: Not an active issue.
   - Continue Citalopram dose once taking po
   .
   FEN: Hypovolemic - 1L NS; replete PRN; NPO
   .
   Ppx: SCDs, bowel regimen PRN
   .
   Code: Presumed Full (patient nonverbal, unable to reach wife)

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of TIA's, Binswanger's disease, recent discharge after a fall, confusion for one day, urinary tract infection (UTI), possible pneumonia (PNA), and acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient has been admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Multifactorial acute mental status changes (AMS) due to underlying Binswanger's disease, TIAs, chronic SDH, new UTI, possible PNA, and acute SDH.
2. Infection/sepsis - UTI, possible PNA, and open chest tube site.
3. Neurological deterioration - worsening of chronic SDH, occult seizures.
4. Pneumonia - atelectasis in the left retrocardiac space.
5. Pressure ulcers - due to immobility.
6. Malnutrition - dysphagia and NPO status.
7. Lumbar mass - further evaluation required.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided progress note. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment and management plan for the patient."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of TIA's, Binswanger's disease, and previous falls. He presented with altered mental status (AMS) and was found to have an acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH). The patient's mental status and mobility have slightly improved, but he still does not respond to commands. Physical examination reveals dry oropharynx, supple neck, rales in the lungs, soft abdomen with no organomegaly, grimacing to left flank pressure, and ecchymosis over the left shoulder. Neurological examination shows mild rigidity, downward-going toes bilaterally, 3-beat clonus on the right, and inability to appreciate on the left.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Acute SDH: Mental status and mobility continue to improve slightly. Continue neuro checks every 2 hours for now, low threshold to re-image and to immediately call Neurosurgery.
2. UTI: Marginally positive urinalysis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of TIA's, Binswanger's disease, and a recent fall resulting in multiple fractures. He was admitted to the ICU with altered mental status, which is improving slightly. The patient has an acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), a urinary tract infection (UTI), and multiple medical conditions that require ongoing management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient's EEG results are pending, and he is currently on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis. The change in antibiotics may lower the seizure threshold, increasing the risk of seizures.
2. Worsening Neurological Status: The patient has an acute SDH and Binswanger's disease, both of which can lead to neurological deterioration. Close monitoring of his neurological status is essential, and prompt imaging and consultation with neurosurgery should be considered if there is a decline.
3. Complicated UTI: The patient has a marginally positive urine analysis, indicating a UTI. Given his male gender and recent indwelling Foley catheter, this UTI is considered complicated. Appropriate antibiotic therapy and follow-up urine cultures are necessary to treat the infection effectively.
4. Pain Management: The patient has multiple fractures from a recent fall, and pain management is an issue. However, due to his altered mental status, narcotics are being held. Alternative pain management strategies, such as a lidoderm patch"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing an altered mental state, which is attributed to an infection on the background of a recent left subdural hematoma (SDH). The condition is improving with the treatment of systemic infection and will be monitored closely.

2. SDH: The patient has a likely traumatic SDH related to a recent fall. Although the CT scan shows that the SDH is stable, and neurological exams are improving, it is expected that drainage may be required in the next few weeks unless there is an acute expansion. The patient may need to be transferred to a medical hospital for further neurological checks.

3. Aphasia: The patient is experiencing Broca's type aphasia, which is likely related to the SDH or local head trauma. This condition involves difficulty in speech and communication. Monitoring and supportive care will be provided.

4. Sepsis: There is evidence of a urinary tract infection (UTI) leading to sepsis. Antibiotics will be administered to treat the infection.

5. Nutritional support: As the patient's mental status improves, nutritional support through oral intake (PO) will be initiated.

6. ICU care: The patient will receive general ICU care, including prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP"

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), Binswanger's disease, and a recent fall resulting in altered mental status. The patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical conditions including an acute on chronic subdural hematoma (SDH), urinary tract infection (UTI), multiple fractures from the fall, dysphagia, dyslipidemia, depression, and an incidental lumbar mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute SDH: The patient has an acute on chronic SDH, which can lead to increased intracranial pressure and neurological deterioration if not managed properly.
2. UTI: The patient has a positive urine analysis for infection, indicating a UTI. If left untreated, it can lead to worsening of symptoms and potential kidney complications.
3. Multiple Fractures: The patient sustained multiple fractures from the fall. These fractures may cause pain and could increase the risk of complications such as pneumonia due to limited mobility.
4. Dysphagia: The patient had dysphagia, which has since improved with speech and swallow testing. However, there is still a risk of aspiration pneumonia if proper precautions are not taken during feeding.
5. Binswanger's Disease/Progressive Neurological Deterioration: The patient has Binswanger's disease, a form of vascular dementia. Progressive neurological deterioration can occur if the underlying vascular pathology is not adequately"

   Assessment and Plan
   67yoM c hx  TIA's, Binswanger's, s/p fall p/w with AMS, now with ?
   +UTI, L acute on chronic SDH.
   .
   # Acute SDH: Mental status and mobility continues to improve.
   Dysarthria much improved. Neuro checks now q4hrs.
   -          continue dilantin, following levels
   -          f/u final EEG read
   -          Holding off giving more platelets currently
   -          Holding narcotics given prior change in MS
   -          Follow-up as outpatient with Neurosurgery 4-8 weeks.
   # UTI: Marginally positive U/A. UCx pending. Currently day [**3-16**] with
   Ceftriaxone for complicated UTI.
   -          follow-up UCx
   -          Cont Complicated UTI tx for 4 more days
   # S/P fall with multiple fractures:  Pt tolerating pain. Holding
   narcotics.
   - Would Consider lidoderm patch on L flank for rib pain if needed
   .
   # Dysphagia: Passed speech and swallow
   - Advance diet per nutrition recs
   .
   # Binswanger's disease/Progressive neurological deterioration
   - Holding outpatient medications given recent bleeding
   .
   # Lumbar mass: Incidental lumbar mass on MRI L-spine, etiology of this
   is unknown.
    - Defer to outpatient work-up
   .
   # Dyslipidemia: Not an active issue.
   - will consider Atorvastatin when taking good PO
   .
   # Depression: Not an active issue.
   - Continue Citalopram dose once taking po
   .
   FEN: Hypovolemic, - KVO; replete PRN; advancing diet per Speech Swallow
