   Assessment and Plan
   Patient is a  80 year old female with severe COPD, diabetes, lung
   cancer, morbid obesity, who presents to ICU s/p ERCP in setting of
   hypoxia and reintubation
   .
   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
   Differential includes myocardial infarction, aspiration in setting post
   procedure, COPD exacerbation/OSA, early sepsis given ERCP and possible
   bacteremia, pulmonary edema although less likely given chest
   radiograph. Pancreatitis post ERCP causing ARDS is also less likely
   given clinical picture. Also may have had mucus plug and component of
   atelectasis given her body habitus.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will cover with levo/flagyl to cover for pulmonary and biliary
   process
   - add on diff
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - continue to trend cardiac enzymes
   - repeat ECG in AM
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean down ventilator settings in hope of early extubation, will
   foloow ABG closely and wean sedation in AM to plan for RSBI, patient
   did excellent on PS trial, will rest o/n on AC and plan to switch back
   to PS at 0400 with plan to extubate in AM
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis
   - hold anti-hypertensives

   #. Hypoxia/Hypotension
 likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and
   diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema.  Possible
   that her epigastric pain was actually referred myocardial ischemia.
   - repeat CXR in AM
   - pan culture blood, urine, sputum
   - will d/c abx as patient is afebrile and wbc trending down and low
   suspicion of infection.
   - TTE to assess EF and WMO
   - nebulizer treatments
   - wean sedation to plan for RSBI and PSV.  Will try to optimize HR and
   BP control prior to extubation.
   - volume challenge with normal saline for HoTN although suspect this is
   sedation/med related and less likely to be sepsis

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with severe COPD, diabetes, lung cancer, and morbid obesity. She is currently in the ICU after undergoing an ERCP procedure and experiencing hypoxia and reintubation. 

The patient has been on arterial line since June 18th, 4:38 PM and was initially tried on PSV (pressure support ventilation) for about an hour last night but was switched to assist-control (A/C) mode to rest overnight for possible extubation today. She has been sedated with propofol. 

This morning, there was a bump in central venous (CV) pressure, so she was started on Hep Drip. The cardiology service was contacted last night and showed EKGs, which they were not too concerned about. They plan to see her this morning and obtain repeat EKG. She is also receiving aspirin per rectum (ASA PR). 

Her lab results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 13.7 K/uL, low hemoglobin (Hgb) at 11.4 g/dL, elevated glucose at 136 mg/dL, and abnormal liver function tests with elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT). Her cardiac enzymes (CK, MB, Troponin-T) are positive, indicating cardiac ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with severe COPD, diabetes, lung cancer, and morbid obesity. She was admitted to the ICU after an ERCP procedure and required reintubation due to hypoxia. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is currently sedated with propofol. She has shown improvement overnight but experienced a bump in central venous pressure (CE) this morning, so she was started on heparin drip. The cardiologists were not too concerned, but they plan to see her this morning and may start her on hepatitis if they rule in myocardial infarction (MI). Her repeat EKG showed no changes. The patient has allergies to penicillins and had a last dose of antibiotics, metronidazole, at 06:08 AM. She is receiving Heparin Sodium at a rate of 1,100 units/hour and propofol at 50.5 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid) at 12:00 AM and heparin sodium prophylaxis at 12:00 AM. The patient's medical and family history remain unchanged from admission, except for the addition of a previous MI. Review of systems is unchanged except as noted below.

Physical examination findings include a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 112/62 mmHg to "

   24 Hour Events:
   Approx 1 hr after extubation, patient began having respiratory distress
   c/b tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency.  She was not
   hypoxic, but clinically was in acute pulmonary edema.  She was treated
   initially with lisinopril and IV lopressor without improvement in her
   BP.  Widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes were noted on
   telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was given oxygen,
   aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was started on a nitro
   gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro was uptitrated with
   gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained in resp distress
   and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was obtained, but
   ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute intervention was
   deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin gtt, plavix,
   aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor.

   #Respiratory distress
 Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Compromised LV filling due to HR led to acute pulm
   edema and worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic
   diastolic dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation,
   ventilation on current settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60; may uptitrate PEEP to improve
   oxygenation while decr. FiO2
   -Gentle diuresis as BP tolerates
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction

A cardiology consultation was obtained, and she was started on heparin gtt, plavix, aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor. The patient has been sedated and intubated. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 88/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She is on mechanical ventilation support with FiO2 at 60% and PEEP at 8 cmH2O. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low platelet count, elevated troponin T levels, and other abnormal lab values. The patient's assessment and plan include continued full vent support, weaning FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60, uptitration of PEEP to improve oxygenation while decreasing Fi"

   24 Hour Events:
   Approx 1 hr after extubation, patient began having respiratory distress
   c/b tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency to 220
s/150
   She was not hypoxic, but clinically was in acute pulmonary edema.  She
   was treated initially with lisinopril and IV lopressor without
   improvement in her BP.  Widened QRS complexes and ST segment changes
   were noted on telemetry. 12-lead EKG showed evolving ischemia. She was
   given oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and was
   started on a nitro gtt when her BP remained markedly elevated. Nitro
   was uptitrated with gradual resolution of HTN, but the patient remained
   in resp distress and was reintubated.  Cardiology consultation was
   obtained, but ischemia was thought to be rate-related and acute
   intervention was deferred.  She was subsequently treated with heparin
   gtt, plavix, aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor.

   Assessment and Plan
   80 y/o F h/o lung CA s/p LL lobectomy, home O2-dependent a/w
   respiratory failure s/p ERCP, now with recurrent acute respiratory
   failure following trial of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   -[**Month (only) 60**] benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to
   maintain positive pressure
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS
   in the setting of presumed underlying CAD; no acute intervention
   warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP 90, goal HR 65
   -trend troponin to peak
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -full-dose ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -TTE today to also eval. for WMA, stunned myocardium
   -cards aware of pt, will likely need elective cath when stable
   .
   #Hypotension
 fluid responsive; likely [**12-30**] sedation
   -IVF bolus, decr. sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
   -consider dopa vs. levophed for 1^st line pressor if HoTN refractory to
   IVF
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Does not appear to be overwhelmingly infected although
   new RLL process invokes PNA vs. pneumonitis.  Also dirty U/A. Likely
   element of reactive leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data
   available
   -f/u Cx data
   .
   # Anemia
 Hct stable, but on systemic AC
   - follow [**Hospital1 **]
   - x-fuse to maintain Hct > 30%

   #ARF
 unclear b/l, has remained 1.3-1.4; may be element of ATN in the
   setting of HoTN vs. pre-renal azotemia
   -monitor Cr
   -urine lytes pending

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously treated with lobectomy and is now dependent on home oxygen. She presented with respiratory distress after extubation and was reintubated due to worsening respiratory status. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, chronic LV dysfunction, and possible subclinical CAD. She also has acute diastolic dysfunction, acute pulmonary edema, and evolving ischemia on EKG. The patient was treated with oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and nitro gtt. She remains in respiratory distress and is currently on full ventilator support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recurrent acute respiratory failure indicates a potential ongoing complication of respiratory failure.
2. Demand Ischemia: The reversible ischemic changes on EKG suggest reversible demand ischemia due to tachycardia, hypertension, and presumed underlying CAD. Continuous medical therapy is being provided, and further evaluation with TTE is planned.
3. Hypotension: The patient's fluid-responsive hypotension may be related to sedation or other factors. IVF bolus and titration of lopressor are being used to manage this condition.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis, which may be reactive or due to a new right lower lobe process. Culture data and follow-up are pending.

   #Respiratory distress
 Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Compromised LV filling due to HR led to acute pulm
   edema and worsening resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic
   diastolic dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation,
   ventilation on current settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60; may uptitrate PEEP to improve
   oxygenation while decr. FiO2

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress. She underwent a lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. The patient's respiratory distress occurred approximately one hour after extubation and was characterized by tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypertensive urgency. She exhibited signs of acute pulmonary edema and was treated with lisinopril, IV lopressor, oxygen, aspirin, morphine, additional IV lopressor, and nitroglycerin. Despite these interventions, the patient remained in respiratory distress and required reintubation. A cardiology consultation was obtained, and the patient was started on heparin, Plavix, aspirin, statin, and low-dose lopressor. The patient also has leukocytosis, anemia, COPD, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient experienced respiratory distress after extubation, which required reintubation. This could be due to acute pulmonary edema or compromised lung function. Monitoring and supportive care are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.

2. Hypertension: The patient presented with hypertensive urgency and elevated blood pressure levels. Blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed with appropriate antihypertensive medications.

3. Ischemia: The patient showed evolving ischemia on the EKG, which resolved after"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of COPD, diabetes, lung cancer, and morbid obesity. She presents to the ICU after undergoing an ERCP procedure.

The patient is currently sedated and not complaining of chest pain. Her EKG does not show any ST changes.

The patient's hypoxia and hypotension are likely due to acute myocardial ischemia and diastolic dysfunction causing increasing pulmonary edema. The epigastric pain experienced by the patient may be referred myocardial ischemia. Repeat CXR in the morning is recommended to assess the patient's condition. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures will be obtained to identify any potential infection. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed to evaluate the patient's ejection fraction (EF) and wall motion abnormalities (WMO). Nebulizer treatments will continue, and sedation will be weaned off to plan for respiratory system assessment and pressure support ventilation. Optimization of heart rate and blood pressure control prior to extubation is also planned.

   Assessment and Plan
   81F with h/o abdominal pain, s/p elective ERCP, unremarkable but
   complicated by reintubatation with another extubation yesterday
   requiring reintubation in the setting of likely flash pulmonary edema.
   the etiology of the flash pulmonary edema remains unclear. likely
   contribution from cardial ischemia given positive troponin and ekg
   changes; unable to tolerate sudden withdrawal of positive pressure
   ventilation. waiting for TTE to elucidate the cause.
   plan:
   -medical managment of cad incling asa, heparin gtt
   -cardiology following, waiting for attending recs esp. re timing of
   cath if needed
   -no sbp today. waiting for additional cardiac work-up
   -new Right lower lobe process, infiltrate of fluid; will monitor for
   signs of infection such as fever, secretion. holding off on antibiotics
   for now
   -once cardiology plan is clarified, will need diuresis, possible
   initiation of nitro gtt prior to the next extubation attempt
   1)Respiratory Failure
patient with clear evolution of acute onset of
   pulmonary edema following extubation.  This is the second time that we
   have seen a sequence of
looking favorable for extubation
evolution of
   significant evidence of tachycardia/tachypnea/hypertension and then
   with likely elevations in LVEDP onset of acute hydrostatic pulmonary
   edema leading to hypoxemic respiratory failure.  In this setting there
   is signficant elevation of troponin and CK consistent with some
   myocardial ischemia and injury.  In addition, patient did have
   epigastic discomfort at the time raising the question of her pain being
   anginal in nature.   Although this is unlikely to represent acute
   coronary syndrome is may well represent significant fixed obstruction
   with signifiant obstruction to flow contributing to recurrent hypoxemic
   respiratory failure.
   -Currently on B-Blocker/Heparin/TNG with goal to diurese
   -Cardiology to consider timing of intervention based on this clinical
   scenario and overall clinical picture
   -Will maintain in A/C and move to wean to PSV when possible.
   -Will not move to SBT in the setting of active ishcemia and plan to
   maintain full support for minimum of 48 hours
   2)Pulmonary Infiltrate
Patient with repeated intubation and although no
   significant aspiration seen at the repeat intubation
aspiration is
   certainly a risk.  She does have a single GPC found in sputum culture.
   Her CXR shows evidence of new right lower lobe opacity with suggestion
   of small effusion.
   -Would favor antibiotics to start in the setting of new infiltrate,
   increased WBC count  should evolution of significant fever or sputum
   production be seen.
   -Will repeat CXR in AM

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is an 81-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. She has a history of abdominal pain and underwent an elective ERCP, which was unremarkable but complicated by reintubation due to flash pulmonary edema. The cause of the flash pulmonary edema is unclear, but it may be related to cardiac ischemia given positive troponin levels and EKG changes. The patient was unable to tolerate sudden withdrawal of positive pressure ventilation and required reintubation.

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Her current medications include aspirin, heparin, and a beta-blocker. She also has a penicillin allergy.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 68 beats per minute, blood pressure of 112/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on endotracheal tube with CPAP. Her central venous pressure is 13 mmHg, and she has received a total of 2,335 mL of intravenous fluids since midnight.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 13.7 thousand/mm³, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 237 thousand/mm³, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 114"

- The patient is an 81-year-old female with a history of abdominal pain, who underwent an elective ERCP procedure.
- The patient experienced respiratory failure and required intubation. Initially extubated, but had to be reintubated due to worsening abdominal pain, respiratory distress, and increasing heart rate and blood pressure.
- The patient showed EKG changes with widening QRS and increasing ST segment, indicating possible cardiac ischemia. These changes resolved with better rate control.
- The patient received multiple medications, including heparin, midazolam, fentanyl, hydralazine, morphine sulfate, famotidine, metoprolol, and regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control.
- The patient had a central line placed and received fluid boluses overnight for hypotension.
- The patient was on non-invasive ventilation for a short period but required invasive ventilation due to respiratory distress.
- The patient had a multi-lumen line started and an arterial line placed.
- Laboratory results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated platelet count, and abnormal kidney function tests.
- The patient's cardiac enzymes were elevated, indicating possible cardiac damage.
- The patient had a new right lower lobe process with fluid infiltrate, which will be monitored for signs of infection.
- The plan includes medical management of CAD, cardiology follow-up, waiting for additional cardiac work-up, monitoring for infection"

   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure

   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today

   Disposition: ICU following cardiac cath
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and previous left lobectomy. She is currently in the ICU due to recurrent acute respiratory failure following extubation. The patient has several medical conditions and complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which is likely caused by the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation. This event was similar to a previous episode following ERCP. The patient's marked hypertension in the setting of respiratory distress may have produced tachycardia, leading to acute diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary edema, and worsening respiratory status. The patient's chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD may be contributing factors.

2. Demand Ischemia: The patient has reversible ischemic changes on EKG that resolved once the distress, tachycardia, and hypertension were addressed. These changes are more consistent with demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). No acute intervention is warranted at this time, but the patient will continue medical therapy. The goal is to maintain a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mmHg and heart rate (HR) of 65 beats per minute. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed preserved biventricular function but increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mild aortic stenosis. A wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded due to sub"

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
   effusion.
   IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved
   global biventricular systolic function. Minimal aortic valve stenosis.
   Mild mitral regurgitation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a lobectomy and is now dependent on home oxygen. She presented with respiratory failure after an ERCP procedure and again after extubation, suggesting a precipitating event related to abrupt removal of PEEP. The patient has acute pulmonary edema, which could be due to diastolic dysfunction caused by tachycardia. There is evidence of chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease. The patient is currently on full ventilator support, with FiO2 being weaned to maintain a PO2 > 60. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) are being administered due to coag + staph in sputum GS. The patient's volume status should be maintained even today, and there is a benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to maintain positive pressure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory failure, likely due to the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation, similar to an event following an ERCP procedure. Adequate oxygenation and ventilation are currently being maintained on the ventilator settings.

2. Acute Diastolic Dysfunction: The patient's acute diastolic dysfunction is causing acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status. The elevated afterload due to hypertension may have led to tachycardia in an attempt to generate cardiac output."

   24 Hour Events:
   TTE [**6-20**] - The left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size.
   There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
   size and global systolic function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal
   technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully
   excluded. The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a minimally increased gradient
   consistent with minimal aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation
   is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
   mitral valve prolapse. No mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
   pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial

   failure following trial of extubation.
   .
   #Respiratory failure
 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation
 pt had similar event following ERCP.  Marked
   HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia in an
   attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute diastolic
   dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and worsening
   resp status.  O2-requirement at b/l invokes chronic LV dysfunction
   and/or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation, ventilation on current
   settings.
   -Cont. full vent support
   -Wean FiO2 to maintain PO2 > 60
   -Aim to keep volume status even today
   -TTE today eval for LV dysfunction
   -[**Month (only) 60**] benefit from rapid transition to CPAP following extubation to
   maintain positive pressure
   .
   #Demand ischemia
 Reversible ischemic changes on EKG resolved once no
   longer distressed, tachycardic, hypertensive; more c/w demand than ACS
   in the setting of presumed underlying CAD; no acute intervention
   warranted, will cont. medical therapy; goal SBP 90, goal HR 65
   -trend troponin to peak
   -heparin gtt, goal PTT 60-80
   -full-dose ASA, plavix
   -titrate lopressor to HR 65 as BP allows
   -TTE today to also eval. for WMA, stunned myocardium
   -cards aware of pt, will likely need elective cath when stable
   .
   #Hypotension
 fluid responsive; likely [**12-30**] sedation
   -IVF bolus, decr. sedation as tolerated if HoTN recurs
   -consider dopa vs. levophed for 1st line pressor if HoTN refractory to
   IVF
   .
   #Leukocytosis
 Does not appear to be overwhelmingly infected although
   new RLL process invokes PNA vs. pneumonitis.  Also dirty U/A. Likely
   element of reactive leukocytosis.
   -Trend WBC, refrain from treating +GS sputum until culture data
   available

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer and a previous left lobectomy. She is currently admitted to the ICU due to recurrent acute respiratory failure following a trial of extubation. The patient has a background of chronic lung disease and is dependent on home oxygen. She underwent an ERCP procedure, which may have contributed to her current condition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, likely precipitated by the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation. This event is similar to a previous episode following an ERCP procedure. The patient's marked hypertension in the setting of respiratory distress may have caused tachycardia as a compensatory mechanism. Acute diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status. Chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD could be contributing factors.

2. Demand Ischemia: Reversible ischemic changes on the EKG resolved once the patient was no longer distressed, tachycardic, and hypertensive. This suggests demand ischemia rather than acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the patient has a history of presumed underlying CAD, and no acute intervention is warranted at this time. Medical therapy will be continued, aiming to keep systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 90 mmHg and heart rate (HR) at 65 bpm. Troponin levels should be"

   did have RLL infiltrate which is likely transient aspiration

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a lobectomy and is now dependent on home oxygen. She was admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure after an ERCP procedure and developed acute pulmonary edema following extubation. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including respiratory failure, demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure (ARF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The patient is currently on full ventilatory support and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected MRSA and GPC clusters in her blood culture.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's primary concern is respiratory failure, which could worsen if there is inadequate oxygenation or ventilation support.
2. Cardiac Issues: The patient has evidence of acute diastolic dysfunction and moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension. These cardiac issues may lead to further complications such as heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The presence of MRSA and GPC clusters in the sputum and blood cultures indicates an active infection. It is crucial to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy to prevent the spread of infection and potential sepsis.
4. Acute Renal Failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, and careful monitoring of fluid balance and electrolyte levels is necessary to prevent further deterioration.
5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously treated with lobectomy and is dependent on home oxygen. She presented with respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP, and now has recurrent respiratory failure. The patient also has acute pulmonary edema, marked hypertension, and tachycardia. There is suspicion of precipitating events such as abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation and an episode of hotheadedness. The patient has multiple medical conditions including GPC bacteremia, demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, and diabetes mellitus.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory failure, which can be life-threatening if not managed properly.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient is experiencing acute pulmonary edema, which can worsen respiratory status and lead to further complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient has marked hypertension, which may contribute to cardiovascular complications if not controlled.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia can be a result of the stress on the cardiovascular system due to respiratory distress and other factors.
5. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has GPC bacteremia, which requires appropriate antibiotic treatment to prevent further complications.
6. Demand Ischemia: The patient may have demand ischemia, indicating reduced blood flow to the heart muscles, which can increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a lobectomy and is dependent on home oxygen. She presented with respiratory failure after an ERCP procedure and is currently experiencing recurrent respiratory failure in the setting of acute pulmonary edema following a trial of extubation. The patient has several medical conditions including chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD, COPD, DM, anemia, ARF, and demand ischemia. She is currently on full vent support and is being treated with multiple medications including vancomycin, cefepime, heparin, aspirin, and Plavix. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 60 bpm, blood pressure of 118/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 95%, and a CVP of 15 mmHg.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing recurrent respiratory failure and is on full vent support. There is a risk of further deterioration in her respiratory status.
2. Acute diastolic dysfunction: The patient has evidence of acute diastolic dysfunction, which can lead to acute pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
3. Cardiac catheterization complications: The patient is scheduled for a diagnostic cardiac catheterization, which carries its own risks such as bleeding, arrhythmias, and contrast-induced nephrop"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who is dependent on oxygen at home. She was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following an ERCP procedure. The patient experienced recurrent respiratory failure due to acute pulmonary edema after extubation. The precipitating event was the abrupt removal of PEEP upon extubation, similar to an event that occurred following the ERCP.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and worsening respiratory status. Oxygenation and ventilation are being maintained on current settings. There is an improvement in right lower lobe opacity on the chest X-ray, which indicates pneumonitis. The patient has coagulasive negative staphylococci in her sputum culture.

The plan of care includes continuing full ventilator support, weaning FiO2 to maintain PO2 above 60, continuing vancomycin and cefepime for broad coverage, aiming to keep volume status even, and considering a rapid transition to CPAP following extubation.

Other medical issues include demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes mellitus (DM), sedation, fluid/electrolyte management, and infection control measures.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition and previous episodes of respiratory failure indicate a high risk for continued respiratory distress and potential"

   procedures, and now failed 2 extubations likely from acute flash
   pulmonary edema for unclear reasons, likely component of ischemia with
   small vessel disease and stiff ventricles. components of anxiety
   peri-extubation as well.
   RESP FAILURE
   -repeat xray today
   -continue to diurese aggressively
   -will need nitro gtt peri extubation

   -repeat TTE given murmur; may need TEE
   -follow-up speciation and suscept
   -resent blood cultures and tip for culture

   -continue statin and bb
   -can stop asa, plavix
   DISPO ISSUES:
   -pt to remain in the ICU
   I was physically present with the resident and fellow team for
   discussion of the patients course on this day and would agree with the
   note in full.  I would add
Patient with no evidence of stenosis of
   epicardial vessels based on cardiac catheterization.  She now has some
   persistent fevers in the setting of pulmonary infiltrate and CVL.  Her
   goals for successful extubation will likely depend on adequate
   stabilization of blood pressure and heart rate following extubation.
   For today
   -Will move to PSV wean today
   -Continue with diuresis
   -Will change CVL given fevers and concern for blood stream infection
   -Lisinopril for afterload reduction
   -Consider extubation on IV nitrate to control hemodynamics post
   extubation
   -Hope to diurese effectively
   -Suggest extubation to BIPAP when ready to trial.

He was intubated before the procedure and has since experienced two failed extubations due to acute flash pulmonary edema. The patient has a history of abdominal pain, and his recent lab results show positive BCX and MRSA in sputum. He has also been experiencing low-grade fevers. The patient is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure ranging from 97/46 mmHg to 155/94 mmHg, heart rate between 54-69 bpm, respiratory rate of 13-16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. His current weight is 117.8 kg, and he has a CVP of 15 mmHg. The patient is receiving furosemide infusion and other medications.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, but he is well-nourished and overweight. His cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI, S1, and S2 with no murmurs. His extremities are warm and well-perfused. Neurologic examination is not assessed due to sedation.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.9 g/dL, elevated white blood cell count of 239 K/uL, and plate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of COPD, abdominal pain, and admitted for an elective ERCP. The patient was intubated before the procedures and subsequently failed two extubations likely due to acute flash pulmonary edema, possibly related to ischemia with small vessel disease and stiff ventricles. The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, and there are concerns for MRSA PNA/bacteremia. The patient also has a history of CAD, and disposition issues need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation increases the risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and support through mechanical ventilation may be necessary.
2. MRSA PNA/Bacteremia: The presence of MRSA pneumonia and bacteremia poses a significant risk. Appropriate antibiotic therapy, including vancomycin, should be continued, and the dosing should be adjusted based on drug levels. Cultures should be repeated to identify the causative organism and guide further treatment.
3. Cardiac Issues: The patient's history of CAD and the development of a new murmur warrant further investigation. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is recommended, and if necessary, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) should be considered to assess cardiac function and structure.
4. Disposition Issues: Given the patient's critical condition, ongoing care in the"

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who is currently dependent on oxygen due to respiratory failure following an ERCP procedure. She has had recurrent respiratory failure and is now experiencing acute pulmonary edema. The patient's vital signs show hypertension and tachycardia, and she has been diagnosed with acute diastolic dysfunction. Her oxygen requirement suggests chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease. The patient's laboratory results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and troponin T, among others. She is currently on multiple medications including furosemide, famotidine, midazolam, and propofol. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's history of recurrent respiratory failure and acute pulmonary edema puts her at risk for continued respiratory distress and potential respiratory failure.
2. Acute diastolic dysfunction: The patient's elevated blood pressure and tachycardia have led to acute diastolic dysfunction, which can result in decreased cardiac output and further respiratory compromise.
3. Chronic LV dysfunction and/or subclinical CAD: The patient's oxygen requirement suggests chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease, which can lead to ongoing cardiac issues.
4. GPC bacteremia: The patient has a central line infection with gram-positive cocci, which can progress to sepsis if not treated promptly.
5. Anemia: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   Sepsis, respiratory failure (recurrent pulmonary edema)
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- Good progress on ventilator.  Failed extubation
   x2 --> attributed to flash pulmonary edema.  Plan to continue net
   diuresis (and possible afterload reduction).  Work towards SBT and
   extubation trial following adequate diuresis and BP control.
   HYPERTENSION -- underlying medical condition, exacerbated by anxiety
   (intubation), and contributing to develpment of pulmonary edema.
   [**Hospital 3795**] medical management.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- attributed to diastolic dysfunction (hypertension).
   Control hypertension, afterload reduction, net diuresis.
   BACTEREMIA -- staph coag negative; likely line-related infection.
   Central line resighted.  Continue antimicrobials.
   AGGITATION -- add propofol to Fentanyl
   SEPSIS -- s/p ERCP.  Good response to current regimen.
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.
   h/o lung CA -- s/p LLL lung resection, remote.  Loss of lung parenchyma
   possibly contributing to inability to successfully extubate.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a lobectomy and is dependent on home oxygen. She experienced respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure and is currently admitted to the ICU with recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's recent events include an unprovoked episode of respiratory distress on the ventilator, breath stacking that resolved with an increase in PEEP to 10, and an episode of hypotension with a CVP of zero after diuresis. The patient has been repleted with magnesium and potassium. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory failure, which is a critical condition where the lungs are unable to provide enough oxygen to the body or remove carbon dioxide.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient developed acute pulmonary edema due to diastolic dysfunction, which is a condition where the heart is unable to relax properly during the resting phase of the heartbeat, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension with a CVP (central venous pressure) of zero, indicating low blood volume or poor blood flow.
4. GPC Bacteremia: The patient has a suspected GPC bacteremia, which is a bloodstream infection caused by Gram-positive bacteria. She is on vancomycin for this condition.
5. Demand Ischemia: The patient may have demand ischemia, which refers to insufficient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who has been admitted to the ICU due to respiratory failure. She was previously dependent on oxygen at home and experienced respiratory failure after extubation following an ERCP procedure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has recurrent respiratory failure, with acute pulmonary edema after a second trial of extubation. The patient has hypertension and is suspected to have chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease. She is receiving sedation with propofol and has been diuresed with Lasix. The plan is to wean FiO2 to 40% and increase RR to 18 to optimize oxygenation and ventilation. The patient's electrolytes should be followed, and she will be evaluated for extubation tomorrow. She also has a diagnosis of GPC bacteremia, demand ischemia, anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, and diabetes mellitus. Her sedation will be switched from versed/fentanyl to propofol. She is currently comfortable and pain-free.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has recurrent respiratory failure, which is a critical concern in the ICU. Monitoring her oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be crucial to prevent further respiratory compromise.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed acute pulmonary edema following extubation, likely due to diastolic dysfunction. Close monitoring of fluid balance and"

 Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal
   of PEEP upon extubation, similar to the events subsequent to ERCP.
   Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress likely produced tachycardia
   in an attempt to generate CO against an elevated afterload. Acute
   diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia led to acute pulm edema and

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a lobectomy and is now dependent on home oxygen. She experienced respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure, and now she is presenting with recurrent respiratory failure. The patient has acute pulmonary edema, likely due to diastolic dysfunction caused by tachycardia. There is also evidence of chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure of 170/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support with CPAP/PSV mode, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and SpO2 of 98%. The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, continuous leg movement, regular heart rhythm without murmurs or gallops, nonlabored breathing on the ventilator, decreased bowel sounds, and 1+ edema in both upper and lower extremities with nonpalpable pedal pulses.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.2 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin of 9.9 g/dL, sodium of 122 mg/dL, potassium of 5.2 mEq/L, chloride of 106 mEq/L, magnesium of"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient has experienced several episodes of respiratory distress, including an unprovoked episode of breath stacking while on mechanical ventilation that resolved with an increase in PEEP to 10. The patient also had an episode of hypotension with a CVP of zero after diuresis, but responded appropriately to a 500cc bolus.

The patient is currently on propofol for sedation, furosemide (Lasix) for diuresis, and heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4°C (99.4°F), heart rate of 68 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 170/87mmHg to 119/33mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 98% on FiO2 of 40%, and a sinus rhythm.

The patient's physical examination reveals sedation, continuous leg movement, regular heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, nonlabored breathing on the ventilator, and decreased bilateral lower extremity pulses. The patient also has 1+ edema in both upper and lower extremities, nonpalpable pedal pulses, and pneumoboots in place.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's electrolytes are within normal"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.
   Nutritional support -- TF

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.
   Nutritional support -- TF

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient is tolerating propofol and remains on a lasix drip with good clinical response. The patient experienced hypotension last night, with a central venous pressure (CVP) of 0 and a net fluid balance of -5000 mL. The hypotension resolved with an intravenous fluid bolus. The patient also has intermittent agitation.

The patient's medical history is significant for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), advanced, pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction), hypertension, restless legs syndrome, and renal function that is preserved with creatinine levels. The patient requires improved blood pressure control, consideration for tracheostomy, optimization of fluid balance, nutritional support, and glycemic control.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 67 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 104/50 to 171/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds bilaterally, and warm extremities. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count,"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated but is tolerating propofol. They are on a lasix drip with good clinical response. The patient experienced hypotension last PM, with CVP being 0 and a net fluid balance of -5000 mL. The hypotension was resolved with an IV fluid bolus. The patient also experienced intermittent agitation.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4 C (99.4 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 104/50 mmHg to 171/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's rhythm is sinus rhythm, and their weight is currently 117.8 kg, with a height of 65 inches.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for hypotension. In terms of respiratory support, the patient is on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 483 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, PEEP of 10 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an ABG showing pH 7.44, PaCO2 48 mmHg, PaO2 320, and Ve 9.5 L/min.

During the physical examination, the patient appeared comfortable, with no signs of acute distress. The eyes and conjunctiva were normal, with no signs of pallor or scleral edema. The cardiovascular examination revealed a normal PMI, S1 and S2 sounds, and no murmurs or abnormal breath sounds. The abdomen was soft and non-tender, with bowel sounds present. The extremities were warm and had trace edema, with no cyanosis or clubbing. The neurologic examination showed the patient to be sedated but responsive to verbal stimuli.

The patient's laboratory values indicate a WBC count of 12.2, Hct of 35%, Plt of 248 K/uL, Cr of 1.3 mg/dL, TCO2 of 27 mmHg, Glucose levels ranging from 93 to 152 mg/dL, and a PT/PTT/INR of 14.7/23.6/1.3. Other lab results are within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, such as advanced COPD and pulmonary edema. The goal is to work towards another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial if able to remove intravascular volume. The patient also requires improved BP control, consideration of tracheostomy, and optimization of fluid balance. Restless legs syndrome, hypertension, and renal function are also"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory Failure -- multifactorial.  Underlying COPD (advanced),
   pulmonary edema (diastolic dysfunction).  Hope to work towards another
   SBT (failed extubation x2), and extubation trial if able to remove
   intravascular volume.  [**Month (only) 60**] require improved BP control (i.e. ntg or
   nipride).  Condider tracheostomy (discussed with family)
   Fluids -- net volume overloaded.  Continue net diuresis to dry weight.
   Restless Legs Syndrome -- resume pharmacological treatment.
   HTN -- optimize BP control.  Change lisinopril to captopril (shorter
   acting)
   Renal Function -- preserved creatitine.  Monitor urine output, BUN,
   creatitine.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and pulmonary edema. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. He is on a propofol infusion and lasix drip, which has shown a good clinical response. The patient experienced hypotension, possibly due to a negative net fluid balance of -5000 mL, but it resolved with an IV fluid bolus. The patient also exhibits intermittent agitation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's underlying COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and pulmonary edema contribute to respiratory failure. There is a plan to work towards another spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and extubation trial if the patient's intravascular volume is optimized.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be related to fluid overload. Close monitoring and continued diuresis are recommended to achieve dry weight.
3. Restless Legs Syndrome: Pharmacological treatment should be resumed to manage this condition.
4. Hypertension: Optimizing blood pressure control is necessary. Lisinopril should be changed to captopril, which has a shorter duration of action.
5. Renal Function: The patient's renal function is preserved, but monitoring urine output, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and creatinine levels is essential.
6. Nutritional Support: The patient requires nutritional support through enteral feeding (Nutren Pulmonary).

   failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema following a second trial of extubation.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent left upper lobe lobectomy. She is dependent on home oxygen and was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure following extubation after ERCP. The patient's current condition includes recurrent respiratory failure, acute pulmonary edema, hypertension, and tachycardia. She also has a history of COPD, asthma, and chronic LV dysfunction or subclinical CAD.

The patient's vital signs show a low blood pressure (85/31 mmHg), low heart rate (53 bpm), and an oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the recent events.

Fluid balance shows an input of 2,909 mL and an output of 4,760 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,851 mL. The patient's weight is currently 117.8 kg.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (13.4 K/uL), slightly decreased hemoglobin (9.6 g/dL), and normal platelet count (268 K/uL). Other lab values are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and Plan:

   failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema following a second trial of extubation.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].
   -          Propofol was weaned off overnight due to hypotension but
   restarted at half the previous rate due to agitation.
   -          Will monitor BP as pt is more awake and aim for afterload

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She presented with respiratory failure after extubation following an ERCP and now has recurrent respiratory failure, likely due to acute pulmonary edema resulting from abrupt removal of PEEP during extubation. The patient also has hypertension and tachycardia, indicating potential chronic left ventricular dysfunction and/or subclinical coronary artery disease. She requires supplemental oxygen at baseline. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has experienced recurrent respiratory failure, which is a critical concern. It is essential to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation.
2. Acute pulmonary edema: The patient's acute diastolic dysfunction due to tachycardia has led to acute pulmonary edema. Monitoring and managing fluid balance, blood pressure, and heart function will be crucial.
3. Chronic left ventricular dysfunction: The patient's baseline oxygen requirement suggests chronic left ventricular dysfunction. Close monitoring of cardiac function and consideration of cardiac supportive measures may be necessary.
4. Subclinical coronary artery disease: The patient's hypertension and tachycardia raise concerns about underlying coronary artery disease. Monitoring for signs of ischemia or infarction will be important.
5. Infection: The presence of coagulase-negative staphylococci and streptococcus in the sputum culture suggests a potential infection"

   7) Metabolic alkalosis
   Patient has RSBI of 80 today. Mildly agitated off of propofol. BP rises
   with the agitation. Appears to have been diuresed effectively given
   CVP=6 and the hypotension that responded to fluids. Sedation may have
   been contributing to hypotension as well. Family has indicated today by
   phone that they do not want her reintubated if she fails extubation,
   and that they want to be present when the extubation is attempted.
   Mental status improved today, but still not fully alert off of
   propofol. Check for serum levels of benzos and opiates to see if her
   metabolism of these drugs, which were stopped on Saturday, is slowed
   such that they may still be having an effect.
   Continues on vanco for pneumonia. CXR without definitive infiltrate
   now.
   Metabolic alkalosis likely due to diuresis and
   hypokalemia/hypochloremia. Would give back KCl today. Hold fluids even.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical complications. Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaints are respiratory failure, NSTEMI, CHF, and hypotension. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs indicate a low heart rate (52 bpm), low blood pressure (92/39 mmHg), and a slightly elevated respiratory rate (14 breaths per minute). The oxygen saturation level is within normal range at 96%.

The patient has a history of penicillin allergy and is currently receiving several medications including propofol for sedation, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, famotidine (Pepcid), insulin, lipitor, heparin sc, aspirin, celexa, neurontin, lopressor, and captopril.

The flow sheet data shows that the patient has received a significant amount of fluids and blood products. The total input/output balance is negative by 1.851 liters, indicating ongoing fluid loss. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is at 6 mmHg, which suggests an adequate fluid status.

The arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a slightly alkalotic pH of 7.44, with normal carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and oxygen saturation. The PaO2/FiO2 ratio is 230, indicating acceptable oxygenation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (W"

   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT
   difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.
   -          Although unlikely, ACEI could be contributing to laryngeal
   edema

   -          Pt seen by interventional pulmonology for trach placement;
   due to scarring from previous trach, pt will need surgery to place
   trach. General surgery to evaluation pt. Will plan for trach placement
   today or tomorrow, and hold tube feeds for now.

","Summary:
An 80-year-old female patient with a history of lung cancer surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and home oxygen dependency was initially intubated electively for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient experienced flash pulmonary edema during the procedure and failed extubation twice due to laryngeal edema. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced failed extubation twice, which indicates a high risk of respiratory failure. This could be due to laryngeal edema, which can cause upper airway obstruction.
2. Laryngeal Edema: The patient's previous two extubation attempts failed due to laryngeal edema. This suggests that the patient may be prone to developing laryngeal edema again, which can compromise the airway.
3. Gastrointestinal Infection: The patient has a positive culture for MRSA in her sputum, indicating a potential gastrointestinal infection. This could lead to further complications such as pneumonia or bacteremia.
4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's serum creatinine level is elevated at 1.4 mg/dL, suggesting the possibility of acute renal failure. The cause could be pre-renal azotemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
5. Anemia: The patient's hem"

   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted. Racemic epi and Heliox given without effect. O2

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of COPD who was admitted to the ICU for suspected sepsis and respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation and has shown signs of improvement, including increased alertness and ability to follow commands.

However, during the afternoon, the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated. She became increasingly tachypneic, developed stridor and increased work of breathing, leading to a drop in oxygen saturation to 88%. Racemic epinephrine and Heliox were given without effect. The patient's blood pressure also increased to the 200s.

Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who noted the presence of laryngeal edema that made passing a 6.5 tube difficult. The patient's initial settings on the ventilator were A/C 18/550/50/5, and her ABG results showed a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 48, HCO3- of 85, and oxygen saturation of 88%.

The patient has a long-standing history of COPD, although her oxygen requirement has been out of proportion to her disease severity. FEV1/FVC is 50-60% of expected. She has required home O2 of 2L since her left upper lobe lobectomy in 2008. COPD had been stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 65-inch, 102.9 kg male with a history of respiratory failure, presenting in the ICU. The patient's initial blood pressure was in the 90s and was sensitive to propofol, dropping to low 90s. The patient's heart rate was in the 50s. Propofol was weaned off, and captopril and Lopressor were held until the patient's hemodynamics stabilized. The patient's blood pressure has since stabilized in the range of 110-140s.

   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with family the plan for extubation,
   and pt was extubated. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted. Racemic epi and Heliox given without effect. O2
   sat dropped to 88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for
   re-intubation, who noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing
   of 6.5 tube difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG:

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now with recurrent resp
   failure [**12-30**] acute pulm edema following a second trial of extubation.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy. She is dependent on oxygen at home and has been admitted to the ICU for elective ERCP. The patient failed extubation twice due to flash pulmonary edema following extubation after ERCP. She is currently intubated and experiencing recurrent respiratory failure with acute pulmonary edema following a second trial of extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed extubation twice and is currently experiencing recurrent respiratory failure with acute pulmonary edema. This indicates severe respiratory distress and inadequate oxygenation.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient has developed acute pulmonary edema on two occasions following extubation. This suggests an underlying cardiac dysfunction or acute lung injury.
3. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD): The patient has a long-standing diagnosis of COPD with additional features of asthma. Her oxygen requirement is disproportionate to the objective data of pulmonary function tests (PFTs). She has been chronically dependent on oxygen since her left upper lobe lobectomy.
4. Infectious Complications: The patient has GPC bacteremia (likely contamination) and MRSA-positive sputum (may be ventilator-associated pneumonia). She is on vancomycin and has a central line change. MRSA precautions are in place.
5. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient has evidence of di"

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation x 2 with tachycardia and
   hypertension. Suspect precipitating event was abrupt removal of PEEP
   upon extubation both times. Marked HTN in the setting of resp distress
   likely produced tachycardia in an attempt to generate CO against an
   elevated afterload. Acute diastolic dysfxn due to tachycardia led to
   acute pulm edema and worsening resp status. O2 requirement at baseline
   invokes chronic LV dysfxn and /or subclinical CAD. Adequate oxygenation
   and ventilation on current settings. Improved RLL opacity on CXR c/w
   pneumonitis; does have coag + staph in sputum GS from [**6-20**].

","Summary:
An 80-year-old female patient with a history of lung cancer surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and oxygen dependency is currently admitted to the ICU. The patient underwent an elective intubation for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but experienced flash pulmonary edema after the procedure. She failed extubation twice due to laryngeal edema and recurrent respiratory failure. The patient's oxygen requirement is disproportionate to her disease severity, and she has required home oxygen at a rate of 2L since her left upper lobe lobectomy. She also has a long-standing diagnosis of COPD with additional features of asthma. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 78 bpm, blood pressure of 113/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is currently intubated on assist-control ventilation with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has failed extubation twice and is currently experiencing recurrent respiratory failure. This could be due to underlying lung disease, acute pulmonary edema, or other factors.
2. Acute Pulmonary Edema: The patient initially experienced flash pulmonary edema after the ERCP procedure and subsequently developed acute pulmonary edema again following extubation. This"

   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday morning, SBP sensitive to propofol, dips to low 90s. HR 50s
   SB. Propofol was turned off with recovery of SBP to 110-140s.
   Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
   In the afternoon, pt became increasingly more alert with family at
   bedside. Pt was following commands and nodding appropriately to
   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT
   difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer surgery (left upper lobe lobectomy), COPD, and dependence on home oxygen. She was initially intubated electively for an ERCP procedure but experienced flash pulmonary edema and failed extubation twice. The patient's recent events include:

1. SBP sensitive to propofol, with recovery of blood pressure to 110-140s after turning off propofol.
2. Tolerated lower doses of Captopril and Lopressor.
3. Became increasingly alert with family at the bedside, following commands, and nodding appropriately to questions.
4. Initially tolerated extubation well, but then became tachypneic, developed stridor, increased work of breathing, and a drop in oxygen saturation to 88%.
5. Racemic epinephrine, dexamethasone, and Heliox were given without effect.
6. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, noting the presence of laryngeal edema that made passing a 6.5 french ETT difficult.
7. Initial ventilator settings: A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR [Month] 38, decreased to 14, repeat ABG 7.44/50/78/7, RR decreased to 12.

   questions. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 3755**] discussed with pt and her family the plan for
   extubation, and pt was expressed the wish to be re-intubated and/or
   trached if necessary. Pt initially tolerated extubation well, however,
   became increasingly tachypneic, and stridor and increased work of
   breathing were noted within 15 minutes post-extubation. Racemic epi,
   dexamethasone and Heliox were given without effect. O2 sat dropped to
   88%, SBP in the 200s. Anesthesia was called for re-intubation, who
   noted presence of laryngeal edema that made passing of 6.5 french ETT
   difficult. Initial settings A/C 18/550/50/5, ABG: 7.46/48/85/8; RR

   Talked to pt
s outpt pulmonologist, who stated that pt has had a long
   standing COPD, although her oxygen requirement has been out of
   proportion to her disease severity. FEV1/FVC 50-60% of expected. Pt has
   required home O2 of 2L since her LUL lobectomy in [**8-4**]. COPD had been
   stable.

   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3^rd time due to laryngeal edema.
   # Resp failure: Failed extubation again due to laryngeal edema. Has h/o
   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.
   -          Although unlikely, ACEI could be contributing to laryngeal
   edema

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer surgery, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and oxygen dependency. She was initially intubated for an elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) but failed extubation twice due to flash pulmonary edema. The patient's condition has been unstable, with fluctuating blood pressure and heart rate. She required sedation and mechanical ventilation. Despite attempts at extubation, she developed laryngeal edema and required reintubation. The patient has a history of COPD exacerbation with increased oxygen requirement. She also has anemia, acute renal failure, diabetes mellitus (DM), and a possible demand ischemia with biventricular diastolic dysfunction on cardiac catheterization. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an ongoing infection. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy due to scarring from previous tracheostomy attempts. The patient will continue to receive sedation, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's repeated extubation failures and development of laryngeal edema indicate the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring and supportive care are necessary.
2. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient has been on tube feeds, which may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding"

   3) COPD
   4) anemia
   5) Hypernatremia
   6) pneumonia
   Patient failed extubation due to vocal cord edema and stridor. ACE
   inhibitor to be stopped. Given three failed extubations, admittedly
   probably due to different mechanisms, will proceed to trach. We are
   also concerned that the stridor was significant despite the air leak
   when the cuff was taken down; thus, may be difficult to predict when
   the laryngeal edema has resolved. Surgery consulted (percutaneous trach
   cannot be done due to previous procedures in neck). Decadron continues.
   Maintain volume status even. Patient is hypernatremic; should have fee
   water replaced.
   Completing antibiotics for pneumonia. Will reassess off antibiotics.
   Hct stable. No need for transfusion today.
   Continue on inhaled bronchodilators.

   [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25**], MD
","The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of respiratory failure, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient has had worsening stridor during the evening, necessitating reintubation with a 6.5 endotracheal tube (ETT) and reinstitution of mechanical ventilation.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, with a last dose of antibiotics being vancomycin on 06/26/2103 at 08:00 AM. Current infusions include propofol at 40 mcg/kg/min. Other ICU medications include famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and others such as Decadron, captopril, lopressor, neurontin, citalopram, aspirin, heparin subcutaneously, Lipitor, Pepcid, insulin, and Atrovent inhaler.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the worsening stridor. Flowsheet data as of 06/26/2103 at 10:45 AM shows vital signs including temperature (Tmax: 37.7°C, Tcurrent: 37.7°C), heart rate (HR: 67 bpm), blood pressure (BP: 102/38 mmHg), respiratory rate (RR: 15 insp/min), oxygen saturation (SpO2: 96%), and heart rhythm (SR). The patient's weight is currently 102.9 kg and height is 65 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, with total input of 2,507 mL and output of 1,553 mL since 12 AM. Fluid balance is positive at 954 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through an endotracheal tube with a ventilator set at CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode. Vt is set at 550 mL, PS is 5 cmH2O, RR is set at 12, PEEP is 5 cmH2O, FiO2 is 50%, RSBI is 53, PIP is 29 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 20 cmH2O, and SpO2 is 96%. ABG results indicate pH 7.44, PaCO2 50 mmHg, PaO2 156, Ve 8.9 L/min, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 156.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. Eyes/conjunct"

","Summary:
An 80-year-old female patient with a history of lung cancer surgery is experiencing respiratory failure after extubation following an ERCP procedure. She has failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. The patient's medical history includes being O2-dependent, having undergone a left upper lobe lobectomy, and having a previous failed extubation with tachycardia and hypertension. The current assessment suggests that the previous attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP, while this time the tachycardia and hypertension likely resulted from respiratory distress caused by upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema. The patient's current condition includes anemia, acute renal failure, COPD, diabetes mellitus, and demand ischemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has already experienced multiple episodes of respiratory failure, including the current one due to laryngeal edema. This can lead to further hypoxia and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Laryngeal Edema: The patient's laryngeal edema is causing airway obstruction, which can worsen if not managed promptly. This may require surgical intervention for tracheostomy placement.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient has elevated creatinine levels, indicating possible acute renal failure. Proper fluid management and electrolyte balance are crucial to prevent further deterioration of renal function."

   extubation failure x2 previously with tachycardia and hypertension.
   Suspect the previous two attempts failed due to abrupt removal of PEEP.
   This time, the tachycardia and HTN likely resulted from resp distress
   due to upper airway obstruction with laryngeal edema.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy. She is O2-dependent and has experienced respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure. She has failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. An open tracheostomy is planned for today.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C, heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure of 133/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient is intubated and sedated. Physical examination reveals clear to auscultate bilaterally in the anterior exam, soft and obese abdomen, and edematous hands.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.3 thousand/mm³, elevated creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL, and slightly elevated glucose level of 157 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to laryngeal edema.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as indicated by MRSA positive sputum culture.
3. Acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL.
4. Anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.8 g/dL.
5. Demand ischemia with evidence of diastolic dysfunction on cardiac catheterization.
6. Hypernatremia due to free water deficit.
7. COPD exacerbation.
8. Diabetic complications.
9. Sedation-related hypotension or bradycardia.
10. Potential complications related to tube feeds and tracheostomy placement."

   5) Laryngeal edema
   Stable overnight on the ventilator. Would recheck ABG. Reduce minute
   venitilation if pH is alkalemic. Will be easier to extubate patient
   with higher PaCO2 and compensatory renal response. Alkalemic pH will
   lead to loss of bicarb from kidney. Patient to have surgical trach
   today.
   Continues on decadron for laryngeal edema.
   CXR still shows evidence of total body volume overload. Will need
   further gentle diuresis. BUN/Creat remains elevated.
   Low grade fever. Monitor off of antibiotics. No change in tracheal
   secretions.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and laryngeal edema. They have been sedated and intubated, unable to provide their medical history. The patient is on several medications including ACE inhibitors, vancomycin, lasix, propofol, heparin sodium, famotidine, and others. They have a fever and elevated white blood cell count. The patient's vital signs show sinus bradycardia and low blood pressure. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1,777 mL and output of 1,350 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 427 mL. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume set at 550 mL and respiratory system compliance of 57. The arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.31. Imaging reveals probable bilateral pleural effusions and/or atelectasis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, and lactic acid. The assessment and plan include addressing respiratory failure, COPD, cholangitis, diastolic CHF, laryngeal edema, and total body volume overload. The patient continues to receive steroids for laryngeal edema and will undergo a surgical tracheostomy. They are also being closely monitored for glycemic control, nutrition, and infection prophylaxis"

","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, status post left upper lobe lobectomy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who is dependent on home oxygen. The patient failed three extubation attempts following an elective intubation for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and subsequently had a tracheostomy placed yesterday. 

Currently, the patient has a Dobhoff tube for tube feeds and is receiving propofol infusion for sedation. The patient has been noted to have frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) this morning with an increased heart rate in the 80s-90s. A stat electrocardiogram (EKG) was obtained, which showed nonspecific ST changes. Electrolytes were found to be within normal limits, and the patient was ruled in for a myocardial infarction (MI) with a creatine kinase (CK) level of 723 and troponin-T level of 0.71 earlier in the admission. The patient underwent coronary catheterization on [**6-21**], which revealed normal coronary arteries.

The patient's allergies include penicillins, and she has experienced hives as a reaction. The patient's last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin on [**2103-6-26**] at 08:00 AM.

   - Was on vent, now on trach mask.  Monitor closely for any signs of
   resp distress
   - Repeat ABG this AM, check CXR as one was not done this AM.
   - Continue Decadron taper per ENT recs.
   - D/C all sedating meds, keep pt alert.

s HR was high normal today (usually bradycardic), but likely due to
   decreased sedation, and pt became anxious leading to increased HR. EKG

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She presented with respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure. The patient has had three failed extubation attempts, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully placed yesterday.

The patient has a history of respiratory failure, with previous failed extubation attempts. She is currently on a tracheostomy mask and will be monitored for any signs of respiratory distress. Repeat ABG and CXR should be done to assess her condition.

The patient also has a demand ischemia with no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular diastolic dysfunction on coronary catheterization. Her cardiac enzymes were checked, and she is on ASA 81 and statin therapy. Lopressor was restarted due to the patient's increased heart rate.

Additionally, the patient has MRSA positive in sputum, which may be a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, but she is afebrile. A bronchoscopy from [**6-22**] was negative, and Vancomycin was discontinued after a seven-day course. Further antibiotics will be reassessed as the patient does not have increased sputum production and her lung exam is stable.

The patient also has anemia with"

   Patient on trach mask now. Oxygenation 97% sat; ABG is good. Patient's
   work of breathing seems a bit increased. She is awake but not fully
   communicative yet; this is similar to the last time that we stopped
   sedation on her. It took some time before she became fully alert. I
   suspect as she is able to communicate better, she may appear more
   comfortable. Few rales on exam. BUN/Creat still elevated but rales on
   exam. Check CVP.
   Continue bronchodilators. Decadron to be tapered.
   Hct down slightly. No need for transfusion now.

The patient was placed on tracheal mask ventilation (trach mask) and an arterial blood gas (ABG) showed pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mmHg, and PaO2 of 90 mmHg.

The patient's history includes surgical tracheostomy, COPD, chronic CHF - diastolic, and anemia. The patient is currently on trach mask, with oxygen saturation of 97% and good ABG results. The patient's work of breathing seems slightly increased, and they are awake but not fully communicative. The patient has rales on examination, and BUN/Creatinine levels are still elevated. The patient's hematocrit (Hct) is down slightly, but no transfusion is needed at this time.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 137/53 mmHg to 149/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with respiratory failure following extubation attempt. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, last dose of antibiotics being vancomycin on 03/26/2103 at 08:00 AM. The patient is currently receiving several medications including Lopressor, Furosemide (Lasix), Heparin Sodium, and Famotidine (Pepcid). The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 55 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 107/36 mmHg to 169/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 92%. The patient is on 50% tracheal mask oxygen with standby ventilation support. Physical examination reveals rhonchi in upper fields and diminished in the bases. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory failure following extubation attempt. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's respiratory failure following extubation attempt indicates a high risk for further respiratory complications such as pneumonia, atelectasis, or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's fluctuating blood pressure readings may indicate underlying cardiovascular issues such as hypertension or hypotension. Close monitoring of"

   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Continue to hold anxiolytics/ sedatives.
   - Continue steroid taper for laryngeal edema per ENT recs
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **].
   - Decrease Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA). - WBC
   slightly up since [**2103-6-26**]
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to time and
   dose of steroid being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, and lung exam
   stable, will reassess for any indications of recurrent pna and hold off
   on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day course of Vanco).
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who underwent a lobectomy and is home oxygen-dependent. She presents with respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure. The patient has had three failed extubation attempts, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully placed on [**2103-6-27**].

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.6°F), a heart rate of 55 bpm, a blood pressure of 139/49 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's physical examination reveals rhonchi over bilateral lungs and decreased breath sounds in the bases. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and normal platelet count. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's assessment and plan include:
- Continue on tracheostomy and assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having the patient breathe through the nose with the trach closed.
- Reassure the patient until she becomes accustomed to the sensation of breathing through the trach.
- Continue to hold anxiolytics/sedatives.
- Continue steroid taper for laryngeal edema per ENT recommendations.
- Decrease Lopressor to 6.25 mg [**Hospital1**].
- Consider Captopril as outpatient (since Captopril may have contributed to laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
- Continue ASA 81, statin.
- Monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct < 21%.
- CVP adequate, but likely somewhat volume overloaded. Pt was on Lasix at home. Will use one-time doses of Lasix to maintain fluid balance.
- Strict I/Os
- Monitor Cr daily.
- Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI.
- Outpatient follow-up with repeat PFTs.
- Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, Ca WNL.
- Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds.
- Sp and Sw consult for assessment of aspiration risk and passy-muir valve placement.
- Elevate HOB.
- Code status: Full code.
- Disposition: ICU for now as she requires frequent suctions and while Sp & Sw consult is pending."

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously dependent on home oxygen and underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy.
- She presented with respiratory failure following extubation after an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and has failed extubation attempts twice due to laryngeal edema.
- A tracheostomy was successfully placed on [**2103-6-27**].
- The patient is currently on tracheal ventilation and has shown improvement.
- She is being weaned off sedatives and anxiolytics.
- The patient has a history of demand ischemia with no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular diastolic dysfunction on catheterization.
- Her blood pressure is sensitive to Lopressor, causing bradycardia.
- Lopressor dose was decreased to 6.25 mg.
- The patient also has MRSA-positive sputum, likely a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
- Her white blood cell count is slightly elevated, which is believed to be due to steroids.
- The patient has stable anemia, with a hematocrit (Hct) level of 31.3%.
- She has acute renal failure with a creatinine (Cr) level of 1.2 mg/dL.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer who has been experiencing respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure. She has had three failed extubation attempts, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully placed on [**2103-06-27**]. The patient is currently on long-term low-dose aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin therapy for her cardiovascular conditions. She also has a history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute renal failure. The patient's mental status is improving, and she is able to follow commands off and on.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current respiratory failure may worsen if there are further complications or if the tracheostomy site becomes infected or obstructed.
2. Laryngeal edema: The patient's laryngeal edema could recur, leading to another failed extubation attempt.
3. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient has been intubated for an extended period, she is at risk of developing VAP.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and prolonged bed rest increase the risk of DVT formation.
5. Stress ulcers: Critically ill patients are at risk of developing stress ulcers in the stomach or duodenum.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient in the ICU is experiencing respiratory failure following an extubation attempt after ERCP. The patient passed a speech and swallowing test and tolerated a small amount of pudding with some difficulty. A Passy Muir trach valve is being used before attempting to feed the patient orally.

The patient is on a trach collar at 50% with oxygen saturation levels consistently above 94%. The patient has occasional rales in the lungs, which clear with coughing. The respiratory rate is between 20-26 breaths per minute, and the patient is afebrile.

The patient has been given trazodone 25mg for sleep and is on Lasix for excess fluid. The patient has mild edema in the lower extremities and generalized edema. 

The patient is continuing with total parenteral nutrition (TF) at 30mls/hr and has started on a pureed diet yesterday without aspiration. The patient refused pudding or anything orally last night. Colace and senna have been given, and the patient had one formed stool the night before last.

The doses of metoprolol and amlodipine have been decreased due to low heart rate. The patient has allergies to penicillins and experienced hives as a last dose of antibiotics.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), current temperature of 36.3°C (97.4°F), heart"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old female who was admitted for an elective ERCP due to recurrent abdominal pain. She underwent elective intubation and later required a tracheostomy after three failed extubations, with the last one being due to laryngeal edema.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and hives as her last dose of antibiotics. She is currently receiving various medications including heparin sodium (prophylaxis), famotidine (Pepcid), furosemide, dexmedetomidine, lopressor, ropinirole, atorvastatin, aspirin, citalopram, gabapentin, sucralfate, and amlodipine.

Review of systems shows fatigue, no cough, no chest pain, no abdominal pain, no nausea, no vomiting, and no diarrhea. The patient's psychiatric status is also noted as anxious after tracheostomy but responds appropriately.

Flowsheet data shows vital signs with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 52 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/45 to 161/66 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 93%, and sinus bradycardia. The patient's weight is 101.1 kg, and her height is 65 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 7 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,900 mL, output of 3,951 mL, and a negative balance of -1,051 mL since 12 AM.

The patient is on respiratory support with a tracheostomy tube and oxygen delivery device. Her ABG results indicate hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 34 mmHg. Physical examination reveals well-nourished, overweight/obese appearance, normocephalic head, clear breath sounds with crackles at the bases, and soft non-tender distended abdomen.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 20.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 35.4%, platelet count of 38 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose of 117 mg/dL, and troponin-T of 0.03. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure
2. Leukocytosis
3. Delirium/anxiety
4. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)

The patient will undergo further evaluation for infection and monitor WBC trend after discontinuation of steroids. Mental status assessment is challenging due to intolerance to speaking valve, so it will be attempted again today. Encouragement of oral intake and tube feeds is advised. Bed-to-chair activity will be initiated, and rehabilitation will be required post-discharge."

   4. NSTEMI
   Patient looks great sitting in a chair, speaking easily with the P-M
   valve. Edema improved. BUN/Creat ratio elevated. I think we are getting
   near her dry weight. Her baseline diuretic dose has been reintstated.
   Would only allow 500 cc negative fluid balance today. Steroids being
   tapered for vocal cord edema.
   Given leukocytosis, will send c.diff, add on differential, and monotr
   for signs of infection as well as WBC trend after discontinuation of
   steroids.
   Will continue to encourage PO intake while continuing tube feeds.
   Encourage bed to chair; will need rehab after discharge, has been
   screened.

   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema today.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy and is dependent on home oxygen. She presented with respiratory failure following extubation after an ERCP procedure and failed extubation for the third time due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully placed on [**2103-6-27**]. She has a history of multiple respiratory failures, including three failed extubation attempts, with the last one due to laryngeal edema. She is currently doing well on the tracheostomy.

The patient has a positive MRSA sputum culture on [**6-20**], which may be ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, no further antibiotics are being given as there are no signs of recurrent pneumonia and her lung exam/CXR has improved.

She also has demand ischemia, with no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular diastolic dysfunction on catheterization. This may be due to small vessel disease, and there is no active ischemia. Heparin was discontinued after 48 hours.

Her heart rate is very sensitive to Lopressor, so the dose has been decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]. She is also on ASA 81 and a statin.

The patient has stable anemia with a hematocrit level, and her acute renal failure is stable with a creatinine"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who was previously on home oxygen therapy. She has experienced respiratory failure after three failed extubations, with the third one being due to laryngeal edema. A tracheostomy was successfully placed on June 27th. The patient is currently on a tracheostomy mask with FiO2 set at 40% and is tolerating it well. She still has frequent coughing and yellow sputum production.

The patient's recent events include falling out of bed overnight, attempting to pass a bowel movement, and experiencing a low blood pressure episode. Pink urine with clots in the Foley tubing was also noted. The patient is tolerating soft solids in addition to tube feeds and has been weaned from dexamethasone.

The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure of 123/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has shown improvement overall.

Physical examination reveals diffuse coarse breath sounds bilaterally, bruising in the lower left quadrant (likely from hepatic subcutaneous injections), trace edema in both lower extremities, and pedal pulses present. The patient is awake and alert, with good mental status.

   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema today.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50 with 12.5 mg
   [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] yesterday
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr 1.1 today, has been stable.
   - Started home dose of Lasix 60mg PO BID. Will monitor I/Os for goal= -
   0.5 L today
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds. Will cycle it so pt can eat
   orally using the passy-muir valve.
   - Nutrition consult to adjust tube feeds as pt is eating now
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Mental status; able to follow commands off and on.
   - Appears to be improving. Reassess once she can verbalize. Will check
   with family also.
   # Access: Arterial line and LIJ d/c
d yesterday. Has 2 PIVs now.
   # PPX: SubQ Hep, pneumoboots, H2 blocker, elevate HOB
   # Code: Full code as per discussion with pt and family.
   # Dispo: ICU for now as she requires frequent suctions and supervision
   with PO intake. PT to eval pt. Pt was screened by rehab facilities.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer, who is home oxygen-dependent and experiencing respiratory failure after failed extubation attempts due to laryngeal edema. She has been intubated since [**2103-6-27**] and is currently on a tracheostomy (trach) with improved laryngeal edema. The patient also has a history of MRSA infection in her sputum, demand ischemia with no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular diastolic dysfunction, anemia with stable hemoglobin levels, acute renal failure with stable creatinine levels, COPD that has been stable per outside pulmonologist, diabetes mellitus, and is currently on Dobhoff tube feeds with plans for oral intake using a Passy-Muir valve.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure could potentially worsen if there are further complications related to the tracheostomy or if she develops another respiratory infection.
2. MRSA infection: The presence of MRSA in her sputum may indicate a risk for recurrent or worsening pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic treatment will be necessary.
3. Demand ischemia: Although no proximal coronary stenoses were found, the patient still has biventricular diastolic dysfunction. This could indicate ongoing cardiac issues and may require further evaluation or intervention.
4. Anemia: While the patient"

   80F with chronic abdominal pain, admitted for elective ercp, intubated
   electively, s/p three failed extubations, now trached, doing well with
   passy-muir valve. The last failed extubation was due to laryngeal
   edema. She has completed a course of dexamethasone, with presumed
   near-complete resolution of laryngeal edema since the patient is able
   to talk. WBC is coming down without antibitiotics.
   Her heart failure with normal EF was the cause of her prior two
   re-intubations. She is now euvolemic, and has good blood pressure and
   HR control on the current regimen.
   Patient is still getting tube feed through an NG tube. She is
   tolerating POs, and nutrition is working with the patient to take me
   POs. Expect continued improvement; no need for PEG.
   Patient has been evaluate by rehab. Likely discharge to rehab tomorrow.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 80-year-old female admitted for an elective endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The patient experienced three failed extubations, with the last one being due to laryngeal edema. She has been successfully tracheostomized and is currently tolerating a Passy-Muir valve. 

The patient has a history of chronic abdominal pain, congestive heart failure (CHF) with normal ejection fraction (EF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and respiratory failure. The patient's leukocyte count is elevated, indicating leukocytosis. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 128/58 mmHg, heart rate of 62 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. 

The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels. Her electrolytes are within normal range, with the exception of a slightly low potassium level. 

Imaging reveals a clear chest X-ray on the left side. 

The assessment and plan include the patient's respiratory failure, leukocytosis, COPD, and CHF with normal EF. The patient is expected to continue improving and is likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation facility tomorrow. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include further respiratory issues, such as pneumonia or"

   80 yo F with h/o lung CA s/p LUL lobectomy, home O2-dependent, p/w resp
   failure following extubation after ERCP, now failed extubation for the
   3rd time due to laryngeal edema. Trach was successfully placed on
   [**2103-6-27**].
   # H/o resp failure:  3 failed extubation attempts; last due to
   laryngeal edema. Doing well on Trach. Satting well on FiO2 40%. Still
   with frequent cough and yellow sputum.
   - Continue on trach; Assess if laryngeal edema has improved by having
   the patient breathe through nose with trach closed.
   - Pt becomes tachypneic due to anxiety; reassure pt until she becomes
   accustomed to the sensation of breathing thru the trach.
   - Last day of steroid for laryngeal edema [**6-30**].
   - Consider weaning FIO2 down further, transitioning off of trach mask
   as tolerated.
   - Continue chest PT. Will schedule Albuterol/Atrovent nebs.
   - Will give Mucomyst q8 to help with secretions.
   # MRSA + in sputum on [**6-20**] (may be ventilator associated PNA) and
   worsening leukocytosis.
   - Leukocytosis likely due to steroids; Trend corresponds to timing of
   steroids being given.  Trended down today.
   - Given pt does not have increased sputum production, no fevers and
   lung exam/ CXR improved, will reassess for any indications of recurrent
   pna and hold off on further antibiotics (has already completed 7 day
   course of Vanco).
   # Demand ischemia
 no proximal coronary stenoses but biventricular
   diastolic dysfxn on cath; may have distal, small vessel dz; no active
   ischemia, trop peaked on [**6-19**]. heparin gtt was d/c
d after 48 hours.
   # Hypertension: Pt
s HR very sensitive to Lopressor, becomes brady <50
   with 12.5 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Was decreased to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **] [**6-29**]. Episode of hypotension
   to 90s yesterday.
   - Continue Lopressor to 6.25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Consider Captopril as outpt (since captopril may have contributed to
   laryngeal edema, will hold off for now)/ consider [**Last Name (un) 239**] instead.
   - Will d/c Amlodipine, as pt currently intermittently hypotensive.
   - Will also decrease Lasix to pt
s home dose of Lasix 40mg PO bid.
   Previously increased because UOP did not respond adequately, but will
   re-try given intermittent hypotension.
   - Continue ASA 81, statin.
   # Anemia, hct stable.
   -  monitor hct daily, transfuse if Hct< 21%
   # Acute renal failure
 Cr has been stable (1.1-1.2)
   - Will resume home dose of Lasix 40mg PO BID. Will monitor I/Os for
   goal= - 0.5 L today.
   - Strict I/Os
   - Monitor Cr daily
   # COPD
 has been stable per pt
s outside pulmonologist
   - Continue atrovent/albuterol MDI
   - outpatient follow up with repeat PFTs
   # DM
   -          RISS
   # FEN:
   - Has Dobhoff tube now for tube feeds. Will cycle it so pt can eat
   orally using the passy-muir valve.
   - Nutrition consult to adjust tube feeds as pt is eating now. Consider
   holding tube feeds during the day to encourage PO intake.
   - Replete lytes to keep K>4, Mg>2, ca WNL
   # Mental status; able to follow commands off and on.

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is an 80-year-old female with a history of lung cancer surgery, who is dependent on home oxygen and currently experiencing respiratory failure.
- The patient has had three failed extubation attempts due to laryngeal edema, but is now successfully breathing through a tracheostomy tube with FiO2 40%.
- The patient still has frequent cough and yellow sputum production.
- The plan includes continuing tracheostomy care, assessing improvement of laryngeal edema, and transitioning off the tracheostomy mask as tolerated.
- The patient also has MRSA-positive sputum, which may be a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), but no further antibiotics are needed at this time.
- The patient has demand ischemia with no proximal coronary stenoses but may have distal small vessel disease.
- The patient's hypertension is being managed with Lopressor, and Amlodipine is being discontinued due to intermittent hypotension.
- The patient's renal function is stable with a creatinine level of 1.1-1.2.
- The patient has anemia but with a stable hematocrit level, which will be monitored daily.
- The patient's acute renal failure is also stable, and Lasix will be resumed at home dose of 40mg PO BID.
