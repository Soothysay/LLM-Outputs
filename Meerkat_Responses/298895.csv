   24 Hour Events:
   -Initally, she was persistently hypotensive in the SBP range of 80-90,
   required a totoal of 6L of fluid with UOP remaining in the 30cc/hr
   range.  A bladder scan showed no urine, bladder pressure was 12, and
   mixed venous sats were 79- overall consistent with sepsis and not
   abdominal compartment syndrome.  After the sixth liter, her SBP and
   MAPs began to hold steady in the 100-110 range, and her UOP increased
   to 70-100cc/hr late in the evening. MAP's were >65 throughout.
   -AC was successfully weaned to CPAP with resulting ABG of 7.37/139/41

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 57-year-old female with ovarian cancer who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have elevated WBC count.
- She underwent exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, LOA, and removal of peritoneal port.
- The patient is currently experiencing septic shock due to an intrabdominal infection from the small bowel enterotomy.
- She has been started on broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefepime and flagyl) and her central line has been placed with a goal CVP of 14 due to PEEP from the ventilator.
- The patient also has respiratory failure but is doing well on CPAP with an RSBI of 20. She is anxious to have her ETT tube removed.
- Her acidosis has resolved.
- She is anemic with a Hct of 23, likely secondary to blood loss during surgery and dilutional (received 11+ L of IVF).
- Her heart rate is high (tachycardia) due to pain, fever, and infection.
- The patient is NPO for now and has been given SC heparin and PPI prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current condition of septic shock indicates a potential medical complication related to the intrabdominal infection from the small bowel enterotomy.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's urine output has been"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have elevated white blood cell count. She underwent exploratory laparotomy, repair of enterotomy, removal of peritoneal port, and is currently in the ICU. The patient's initial presentation was consistent with sepsis, likely due to an intrabdominal infection from the small bowel enterotomy. She was given broad-spectrum antibiotics and her central line was placed with a goal CVP of 14. The patient's respiratory status improved overnight on CPAP with a RSBI of 20. The patient is anxious to have her ETT tube removed and an ABG will be checked this morning. The patient's acidosis has resolved. Her hemoglobin level has decreased from 34 on admission to 23 today, likely due to intraoperative blood loss and dilutional effects from receiving over 11 liters of IV fluids. The patient's heart rate is elevated and she is tachycardic, possibly due to pain, fever, and infection. The patient is NPO, with central and Foley access in place. She is receiving prophylactic heparin and PPI, and her code status is full code. She will be dispositioned to the ICU for now.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with signs of sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially death if not"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Initally, she was persistently hypotensive in the SBP range of 80-90,
   required a totoal of 6L of fluid with UOP remaining in the 30cc/hr
   range.  A bladder scan showed no urine, bladder pressure was 12, and
   mixed venous sats were 79- overall consistent with sepsis and not
   abdominal compartment syndrome.  After the sixth liter, her SBP and
   MAPs began to hold steady in the 100-110 range, and her UOP increased
   to 70-100cc/hr late in the evening. MAP's were >65 throughout.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with ovarian cancer who presented with abdominal pain and was found to have an elevated white blood cell count. She underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) with repair of an enterotomy, removal of a peritoneal port, and received broad-spectrum antibiotics due to septic shock. The patient's initial presentation included fever, hypotension, and hypotensive shock, likely caused by an intrabdominal infection from the small bowel enterotomy. She has since been repaired by the gynecology service.

The patient's respiratory status has improved significantly, as she was successfully weaned off CPAP and her ABG values are within normal limits. However, she remains anxious to have her endotracheal tube removed. The plan is to extubate her in the morning if her hemodynamics remain stable.

Her acidosis has resolved, but she is experiencing anemia with a hematocrit level of 23% (down from 34% on admission). This is likely secondary to blood loss during surgery and dilutional effects from receiving over 11 liters of intravenous fluids. The plan is to continue monitoring her hemoglobin levels, perform stool guaiacs, follow serial abdominal exams, and consult with surgery for further recommendations. If her hemoglobin drops below 21, she may require a blood transfusion.

The patient is also experiencing sinus tachycardia, which is likely due to"

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of ovarian cancer who presented to the hospital with abdominal pain and was found to have bowel perforation. She underwent surgery for the insertion of a peritoneal port but was discharged and returned with worsening symptoms. The patient is currently intubated in the ICU and is receiving mechanical ventilation. She has been diagnosed with septic shock, peritonitis/perforation, respiratory failure, acidosis, anemia, and requires ICU care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for developing further infections due to her compromised immune system and the presence of a central line.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory function may deteriorate if her lung condition worsens or if there are complications related to mechanical ventilation.
3. Organ Dysfunction: The patient's kidneys, liver, and heart may experience dysfunction due to inadequate perfusion and the effects of sepsis.
4. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure and heart rate may continue to fluctuate, leading to hemodynamic instability.
5. Malnutrition: Prolonged bed rest and critical illness may lead to malnutrition, which can impair wound healing and increase the risk of infections.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs, which can potentially travel to the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism.

","The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of bowel perforation and surgical repair, now presenting with sepsis and other medical complications. She was successfully extubated and received a transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBC). Pain control is being managed with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). 

Allergies include penicillins, levaquin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfonamides, with rashes associated with these medications. The last doses of antibiotics administered were metronidazole at 06:08 AM, vancomycin at 07:19 AM, and cefepime at 08:53 AM.

The patient is receiving various ICU medications, including famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and pantoprazole (Protonix). She also has ongoing PCA fentanyl and KCL/KPhos infusions.

There are no significant changes in her medical or family history, or review of systems. 

Vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 111 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/62 to 116/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on a nasal cannula. Her heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,412 mL, including 906 mL of total IV fluids and 375 mL of blood products. Output consists of 2,205 mL of total output, including 1,090 mL of urine and 95 mL of drainage from an NG tube. There is a slight negative balance of 207 mL.

Respiratory support is provided with an oxygen delivery device set at 2 liters per nasal cannula, and her SpO2 is at 96%. ABG results indicate a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 46 mmHg, PaO2 of 222 mmHg, and a FiO2 of 0.21.

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient without acute distress. Eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and she has diminished breath sounds at the lung bases. The abdomen is soft with no bowel sounds, and there is mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. She is trace edematous in both lower extremities but unable to stand. Skin is warm and without rash, and neurologic examination shows that she is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 24.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, platelet count of 347 K/uL, sodium of 85 mg/dL, potassium of 0.4 mg/dL, chloride of 23 mEq/L, magnesium of 3.6 mEq"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old female with a history of ovarian cancer, who presented with abdominal pain and elevated white blood cell count. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with repair of enterotomy, removal of peritoneal port, and is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Septic Shock: The patient initially presented with fever and hypotension, which suggests the possibility of sepsis or septic shock, most likely due to an intrabdominal infection from the small bowel enterotomy. She has been covered with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and her condition is being closely monitored.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been mildly hypoxic and required supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula. This is likely due to atelectasis secondary to splinting, possibly caused by pain or mechanical ventilation. Pain control and repeat chest X-ray have been recommended to address this issue.
3. Tachycardia: The patient has sinus tachycardia on ECG, which could be related to pain, fever, and infection. It is important to treat the underlying causes and monitor the heart rate.
4. Nausea/Vomiting: The patient has been experiencing nausea and vomiting, for which antiemetic medications have been prescribed on an as-needed basis.
5. Acidosis: The patient previously had acidosis, but it has since resolved.
6. Enterotomy: The patient had"

   lung bases and the costophrenic sulci are blunted. In addition, there
   is
   persistent streaky bibasilar density. The heart and mediastinal
   structures
   are unchanged. The patient has been extubated. A nasogastric tube and
   right internal jugular catheter remain in place.
   IMPRESSION: Evidence for small bilateral pleural effusions. These are
   more
   apparent than previously. Subsegmental atelectasis.
   Microbiology: all culture data: NGTD
   Assessment and Plan
   Impression and Plan:  57 yof with ovarian cancer, s/p recent surgery
   presented with abdominal pain, elevated WBC now s/p ex-lap with repair
   of enterotomy, LOA and removal of peritoneal port.
   .
   # Septic shock - Initial presentation with fever and hypotension most
   likely from intrabdominal infection from small bowel enterotomy.  She
   is now s/p repair with GYN service.  Culture data NGTD.
   - has been covered with broad spectrum abx with
   cefepime/flagyl/vancomycin - would d/c vancomycin today as no clear
   indication for gram positive coverage.  Plan to continue cefepime and
   flagyl for full 14 day course from [**2140-6-9**].
   - cx NGTD
   - Central line with goal CVP of 14
   - Keep NPO for now, f/u surgery recs,
   .
   # Respiratory failure: Has been mildly hypoxic requiring 2L NC, likely
   atelectasis secondary to splinting.
   - Pain control, IS and repeat CXR.  Atelectasis noted on [**6-11**].
   - Extubated w/o difficulty.
   .
   # Tachycardia - sinus tachy on ECG. Likely from pain/fever and
   infection.  Would treat above and follow heart rate for now.
   - Much improved.
   .
   #Pain control: Still using PCA regularly.  Will start low basal
   infusion of fentanyl and uptitrate as needed/tolerated.
   #Nausea: PRN chlorproperazine/zofran.
   #Acidosis: resolved
   #Ileostomy: NPO as per surgery team, pain control.  Discuss antibiotic
   changes and call out as per surgery.
   # Anemia - hct of 25 today, trending down s/p 1 unit yesterday.
   Continue to trend.  Transfuse for Hct < 21, or hypotension.
   - Cont to monitor
   - stool guaiacs
   - follow serial abdominal exam, given post op and risk of bleed
   -f/u srugery recs
   -transfuse<21 unless active signs bleeding
   .
   # FEN - NPO for now, advance as per surgery team

- The patient is a 57-year-old female with ovarian cancer who presented with abdominal pain and elevated WBC count.
- She underwent exploratory laparotomy (ex-lap) with repair of enterotomy, loop osteotomy, and removal of peritoneal port.
- The patient's arterial line was stopped at 11:00 AM.
- She has allergies to penicillins, levaquin, ciprofloxacin, sulfa, and codeine.
- The patient received vancomycin, cefepime, and metronidazole as antibiotics.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.8 C (100 F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 116/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%.
- The patient is mildly tachycardic and has diminished bowel sounds.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,150 mL and output of 3,950 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -1,800 mL.
- The patient is receiving prophylactic heparin and pantoprazole.
- Laboratory results indicate elevated WBC count of 24.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin of 9.0 g/dL, normal sodium and potassium levels, and elevated blood glucose of 101 mg/dL.
- Imaging reveals evidence of small bilateral pleural effusions and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is post-operative respiratory failure. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, Levaquin (Levofloxacin), Ciprofloxacin, sulfa (Sulfonamides), Percocet (Oxycodone Hcl/Acetaminophen), codeine, and Vancomycin.

The patient's 24-hour events include arterial line removal, titrating pain control, and a transient error with dilaudid into PCA instead of fentanyl. The patient was switched back to fentanyl.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were Vancomycin at 08:00 PM on [**2140-6-12**], cefepime at 10:00 PM on [**2140-6-12**], and metronidazole at 05:30 AM on [**2140-6-13**].

The patient is currently receiving various infusions, including lorazepam (Ativan), pantoprazole (Protonix), famotidine (Pepcid), and heparin sodium (prophylaxis). Other medications include changes to medical and family history, review of systems, and flow sheet data.

The patient's vital signs show a maximum temperature of 37.8 C (100.7 F), current temperature of 36.7 C (98.1 F), heart rate of 99 bpm with a"

","Summary:
The patient is a post-operative respiratory failure patient in the ICU. They have been experiencing septic shock, which has resolved. The patient is now stable off the ventilator and is on room air with incentive spirometry. Bowel repair surgery was performed, and the patient has returned with bowel sounds. Pain is controlled with PCA, but the patient experiences pain with movement. Anemia has responded well to transfusion. The patient is in sinus tachycardia but has stable hemodynamics and is urinating well. The patient is being worked on for anxiety and pain control. They are allowed out of bed to a chair if able and are currently NPO (nothing by mouth).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial chief complaint was post-op respiratory failure. Although they are currently stable off the ventilator, there is still a risk of respiratory failure if proper respiratory support and monitoring are not maintained.
2. Infection: Despite the resolution of septic shock, there is still a risk of infection due to the patient's compromised immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
3. Pain Management: The patient's pain is controlled with PCA, but they experience pain with movement. Improper pain management can lead to discomfort, increased anxiety, and potential complications such as muscle atrophy and deep vein thrombosis.
4. Anemia: Although the patient's Hct responded appropriately to transfusion, ongoing monitoring and management of anemia are necessary to ensure"
