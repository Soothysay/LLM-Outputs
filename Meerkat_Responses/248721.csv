   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including pseudomonal sepsis, atrial fibrillation, liver failure, and diabetes mellitus. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently experiencing several medical complications.

1. Tachypnea: The patient is tachypneic, with a respiratory rate in the 30s. An arterial blood gas (ABG) has been ordered, and the patient is being treated for agitation/delirium. The underlying cause of the tachypnea is unclear, but it could be related to respiratory failure or an infection.

2. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 66. The etiology of the hypotension is unclear, but it may be due to myocardial stunning in the context of prolonged bradycardia/asystole and hypoxia. The patient is not on pressors, and IV fluid boluses have been given for poor urine output. Anti-hypertensive medications have been held.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is dependent on mechanical ventilation and has a tracheostomy tube in place. The patient had an apnea episode following a cardiac arrest, and there are concerns about weaning off the ventilator.

4. Renal Failure: The patient is showing signs of renal failure, with rising potassium and creatinine levels. The"

","Summary:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including liver failure, who was recently treated for pseudomonal sepsis. He is currently in the ICU with respiratory failure, acute renal failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of dementia and is experiencing episodes of agitation and anxiety. His current vital signs include a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure in the 120's, pulse rate of 90 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tracheostomy tube and has good air movement in his lungs. He has a PICC line in place for access. Lab results show elevated potassium levels and liver enzymes. The patient's most recent CXR shows mild pulmonary edema and right pleural effusion. The patient's condition remains unstable, and he is currently being treated for multiple complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to his compromised lung function and the need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Acute renal failure: The patient has rising potassium and creatinine levels, indicating potential renal dysfunction.
3. Pseudomonas infection: Although the patient is currently on appropriate antibiotics, there is a risk of ongoing infection due to the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a chronic respiratory failure case with pleural effusions, pneumonia, and anemia. They experienced an episode of tachypnea in the morning, which was possibly related to anxiety. The patient denies any discomfort earlier that day but admits to feeling scared. The ABG showed acute respiratory alkalosis with additional metabolic alkalosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 100.5°F (Tmax), heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/67 mmHg to 98/44 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on tracheal mask ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode.

The patient's physical examination reveals that they appear well-nourished and are not in acute distress. Their eyes and conjunctiva are normal, and there are no signs of endotracheal, NG, or OG tubes. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal pulse and blood pressure. Respiratory examination indicates clear breath sounds without crackles, wheezes, or diminished breath sounds. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds, and no distension or tenderness. Extremities show mild edema in both lower extremities. Skin examination is unremarkable except for mild jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient is attentive"

   73 y/o male with multiple medical problems, most recently being treated
   for pseudomonal sepsis, with afib/aflutter, liver failure, now s/p
   asystolic episode following trach removal.
   # Tachypnia this am: Improved this morning.
   Per nursing pt gets very agitated and anxious, has baseline delirium
   likely on top of dementia. This was seen during his last MICU course.
   When left alone this morning, pt seen to be breathing at a normal rate
   and very calm.
   - Getting an ABG now
   - CXR this morning not appreciably changed
   - Consider treating for agitation/delirium if ABG within reason --> Has
   been getting Ativan/Dilaudid but no antipsychotics --> will  get EKG if
   pt starts on scheduled Haldol or Seroquel later this am
   # Hypotension:  Off of pressors, holding metoprolol.  BPs have
   improved, though we are still not sure why he became acutely hypotense.
   Unclear etiology, but may be due to myocardial stunning in context of
   prolonged bradycardia/asystole and hypoxia.  No clear evidence for new
   infectious process at this time. On [**11-28**] echo patient with preserved
   EF of 70%. No evidence of acute ischemic episode on prior EKG. BP
   currently are improved and pt is not on pressors.
   - Currently MAP 66, not on pressors.
   - Hold anti HTN meds
   - Patient is not a candidate for pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient trached, had apnea following code.
   Looks great on trach mask this morning.  Back to his baseline.
   - F/u ABG this am
   - Will diurese this am with 80mg IV Lasix x1 and f/u UOP, with goals
   for today to keep even
   # Renal Failure:  Patient has CKD after failure this summer.  Had been
   down to Cr of 1.2, now following code, Cr has been climbing.
   - Pt with rising K and Cr but not a candidate for HD, will trend
   - Renally dose mediations
   # Pseudomonas Infection: stop Meropenem today, day 15/15.
   - Will watch fever curve as had low grade fever this am
   - Will consider continuing ABx if spikes through today
   # Afib/Flutter:
   - INR subTx this am, so will increase Coumadin to 3mg / day.
   - Continue digoxin, recheck levels.
   - Continue ASA
   # Depression: continue Paxil.
   # Fungal Gluteal rash: clotrimazole.
   # DM: Patient not requiring insulin on floor, will follow with
   fingersticks TID.
   # Liver failure:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including liver failure, pneumonia, renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and depression. He was recently treated for pseudomonal sepsis and experienced an asystolic episode following tracheostomy removal. The patient is currently in the ICU and is on invasive ventilation. His condition has shown some improvement with better ABG results and decreased tachypnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient has been experiencing hypotension, which is not clear in etiology. It may be due to myocardial stunning caused by prolonged bradycardia/asystole and hypoxia. The current blood pressure is stable without the use of pressors.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had apnea following the code and is currently on tracheal mask ventilation. His respiratory status has improved, and he is expected to maintain his baseline.
3. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease and has experienced renal failure after the code. His creatinine levels are rising, and he is not a candidate for hemodialysis. Renal dosing of medications will be monitored.
4. Pseudomonas Infection: The patient was treated with meropenem for pseudomonal sepsis but stopped on day 15. He will be monitored for fever, and consideration will be given to continuing antibiotics if necessary.

   asystolic episode following trach removal.
   # Tachypnia this am: Per nursing pt gets very agitated and anxious, has
   baseline delirium likely on top of dementia. This was seen during his
   last MICU course. When left alone this morning, pt seen to be breathing
   at a normal rate and very calm.
   - Getting an ABG now
   - CXR this morning not appreciably changed
   - Consider treating for agitation/delirium if ABG within reason --> Has
   been getting Ativan/Dilaudid but no antipsychotics --> will  get EKG if
   pt starts on scheduled Haldol or Seroquel later this am
   # Hypotension: Unclear etiology, but may be due to myocardial stunning
   in context of prolonged bradycardia/asystole and hypoxia.  No clear
   evidence for new infectious process at this time. On [**11-28**] echo patient
   with preserved EF of 70%. No evidence of acute ischemic episode on
   prior EKG. BP
s currently are improved and pt is not on pressors.
   - Currently MAP 66, not on pressors.
   - Hold anti HTN meds
   - Patient is not a candidate for pressors.
   # Respiratory failure: Patient trached, had apnea following code.
   - F/u ABG this am
   - Will diurese this am with 80mg IV Lasix x1 and f/u UOP, with goals
   for today to keep even
   # Renal Failure
   - Pt with rising K and Cr but not a candidate for HD, will trend
   - Renally dose mediations
   # Pseudomonas Infection: stop Meropenem today, day 15/15.
   - Will watch fever curve as had low grade fever this am
   - Will consider continuing ABx if spikes through today
   # Afib/Flutter:
   - INR subTx this am, so will increase Coumadin to 3mg / day.
   - Continue digoxin, recheck levels.
   - Continue ASA
   # Depression: continue Paxil.
   # Fungal Gluteal rash: clotrimazole.
   # DM: Patient not requiring insulin on floor, will follow with
   fingersticks TID.
   # Liver failure:
   - Continue lactulose when patient tolerating tube feeds.

","The patient is a 73-year-old male with multiple medical problems, including recent treatment for pseudomonal sepsis, atrial fibrillation, liver failure, and now experiencing an asystolic episode following tracheostomy removal. The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation, but it was stopped on 2121-12-13 at 01:15 PM. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 38.1°C (100.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/64 mmHg to 138/82 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count within normal range, hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL, platelet count of 354 K/uL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 111 mg/dL, and sodium, potassium, and chloride levels within normal range. The patient's PT/INR is elevated at 16.6/1.5, respectively. The patient's imaging shows mild pulmonary edema with no focal consolidation on 2121-12-13, but worsening edema with a left-sided opacity on 2121-14.

The patient's medical complications include hypotension (not in shock),"
