   Assessment and Plan
   Mrs. [**Known lastname 2655**] is a 48 year old female with PMH of DM, [**Hospital **] transferred from
   OSH with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, ARF likely secondary to
   sepsis after recent liver biopsy.
   .
   # Sepsis: WBC count with bandemia, hypotension, and likely GI source
   given recent biopsy. Also concern for GPCs with recent
   hospitalization.  Patient was hypotensive overnight requiring 2500 cc
   IVF.  WBC trending down this AM to 11.3.
   - Continue to cover empirically with vanco and pip/tazo for skin GI
   source and GPC given recent instrumentation and hospitalization.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC count
   - Bolus for hypotension and low urine output
   - Follow-up culture data from OSH
   - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis as above.  Patient has not
   been tachycardic for unclear reasons.
   - Plan as above
   - Arterial line/CVL if patient has persistent hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/diabetes: Patient has been off of her home regimen of
   insulin.  This may be concerning for fulminant hepatic failure given
   decreased synthetic function as reflected by elevated INR and
   hypoalbuminemia. More likely, however, is that hypglycemia is due to
   sepsis. Patient received D5 1/2NS and then D10 1/2NS.
   - D5 1/2NS MIVF.
   - Hold oral and basal/ISS for now.
   - Continue accuchecks.
   .
   # UTI: UA on admission with pyuria.
   - Continue vancomycin and pip/tazo
   - f/u urine culture
   .
   # Hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic failure: Patient with significant right
   lobe mass now s/p biopsy.  She has very mildly elevated transaminases
   with significant hyperbilirubinemia with mixed conjugated/unconjugated
   picture per OSH lab results. Likely represents cholangiocarcinoma
   versus hepatoma versus metastasis.
   - F/u with liver recs
   - RUQ with dopplers
   - Review/load OSH MRCP
   - f/u hemolysis labs and peripheral smear. If suggestive of hemolysis,
   check Coombs.
   - ERCP today with likely stent placement.
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Creatinine this AM XXXX.  FeNa of 1.9,
   suggesting ATN consistent with hypotension.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Aggressive volume rescucitation as above.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- Patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus.
- She was transferred from OSH with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis after a recent liver biopsy.
- The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, ARF (acute renal failure), and possible GPCs (gastrointestinal procedures-related complications).
- She is currently receiving empirical coverage with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam for skin/gi source and GPC given recent instrumentation and hospitalization.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure of 105/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.
- The patient's WBC count has been trending down from 13.7 to 11.3 K/uL.
- Fluid balance shows a total input of 5,561 mL and total output of 2,511 mL.
- Lab results show elevated creatinine, BUN, bilirubin, liver enzymes, and low albumin and potassium levels.
- The patient has not been tachycardic for unclear reasons.

   sepsis after recent liver biopsy.
   .
   # Sepsis: WBC count with bandemia, hypotension, and likely GI source
   given recent biopsy. Also concern for GPCs with recent
   hospitalization.  Patient was hypotensive overnight requiring 2500 cc
   IVF.  WBC trending down this AM to 11.3.
   - Continue to cover empirically with vanco and pip/tazo for skin GI
   source and GPC given recent instrumentation and hospitalization.
   - Monitor fever curve and WBC count
   - Bolus for hypotension and low urine output
   - Follow-up culture data from OSH
   - Follow-up urine and blood cultures
   .
   # Hypotension: Likely secondary to sepsis as above.  Patient has not
   been tachycardic for unclear reasons.
   - Plan as above
   - Arterial line/CVL if patient has persistent hypotension.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/diabetes: Patient has been off of her home regimen of
   insulin.  This may be concerning for fulminant hepatic failure given
   decreased synthetic function as reflected by elevated INR and
   hypoalbuminemia. More likely, however, is that hypglycemia is due to
   sepsis. Patient received D5 1/2NS and then D10 1/2NS.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, who was transferred from another hospital with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis after a recent liver biopsy. She is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, urinary tract infection, acute renal failure, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, fasting and nothing by mouth status, pressure ulcer prevention, and anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's bandemia, hypotension, and likely gastrointestinal source suggest sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction and potentially life-threatening complications.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has acute renal failure with a creatinine level of 1.5. AKI can progress to chronic kidney disease if not managed appropriately.
3. Hepatic Failure: The patient's significant right lobe mass and mildly elevated transaminases indicate the possibility of hepatic failure. This can result in impaired liver function and potentially life-threatening complications.
4. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The patient's liver mass could potentially be hepatocellular carcinoma, which is a type of liver cancer. If confirmed, it may require further treatment interventions.
5. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus, who was transferred from OSH with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis following a recent liver biopsy. The patient's condition has been complicated by multiple medical issues, including sepsis, hypotension, hypoglycemia, urinary tract infection, hyperbilirubinemia, acute renal failure, hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, fasting, parenteral nutrition, and prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has a high white blood cell count with bandemia, hypotension, and likely gastrointestinal source given recent biopsy. There is also concern for MRSA due to recent hospitalization. Sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly managed.

2. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension may be secondary to sepsis. If not adequately managed, it can lead to shock and organ perfusion failure.

3. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: The patient has been off her home regimen of insulin. Hypoglycemia may be due to sepsis, hepatic failure, adrenal insufficiency, or a paraneoplastic process related to hepatocellular carcinoma. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary, and the"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female admitted overnight as a transfer from another hospital with new-onset jaundice and a liver mass, concerning for cholangitis. She experienced transient hypotension but responded to fluids. The patient is currently awaiting an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). 

Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has leukocytosis and biliary obstruction, which raises concern for cholangitis. She is being broadly covered with antibiotics, and her condition is being closely monitored for signs of septic shock.
2. Obstructive Jaundice: The patient has obstructive jaundice related to an obstructing hepatic mass. She will undergo ERCP for stenting of the obstruction. The results of a previous liver biopsy need to be followed up for a definitive diagnosis.
3. Hypoglycemia: The patient experienced hypoglycemia overnight, possibly related to infection, liver dysfunction, or paraneoplastic processes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) secretion. Dextrose is being continued to maintain normal blood glucose levels.
4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient has non-oliguric AKI with a creatinine level of 1.5. The sediment is consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). Close monitoring of volume status, renal function, and hem"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of a liver mass and presenting with jaundice. She was transferred to the ICU from another hospital for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) due to concerns of biliary obstruction and possible cholangitis. The patient experienced transient hypotension overnight but responded to fluids. She is currently stable and awaiting the ERCP procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. ID (Infection): The patient has leukocytosis and biliary obstruction, which raises concern for cholangitis. She is already on broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam) and will continue these while awaiting culture results. Fluid resuscitation is being provided as needed, and additional interventions may be necessary if septic shock develops.

2. GI (Gastrointestinal): The patient has obstructive jaundice related to an obstructing hepatic mass. She is awaiting an ERCP for stenting of the obstruction. The liver mass biopsy results will be followed up for a definitive diagnosis. Bilirubin levels, coagulation status, and liver function tests should be monitored.

- The patient's current condition includes sepsis/hypotension, hypoglycemia/diabetes, urinary tract infection (UTI), hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic failure, acute renal failure, hypertension (HTN), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), feeding intolerance (FEN), pressure ulcer (PPX), and access site (ACCESS) issues.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an ongoing infection.
- Imaging results show mild intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation, small perihepatic fluid, and a heterogeneous appearing gallbladder without definite evidence of cholecystitis.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating, with hypoglycemia present.
- Her renal function is improving, with a decreasing creatinine level.
- She has increased right-sided infiltrates on chest X-ray, suggesting a possible pneumonia.
- Multiple cultures have been sent to identify the source of infection.
- The patient is receiving antibiotics, insulin, and other medications as needed.

   OSH with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, ARF likely secondary to
   sepsis after recent liver biopsy.
   .
   # Sepsis/hypotension: Continues to have elecated WBC today to 12.5.
   Likely source is hepatobiliary given recent instrumentation as well as
   hepatobiliary pathology as reflected by hyperbilirubinemia.
   - Continue vanocmycin and pip/tazo.
   - Sputum culture
   - Follow-up cultures
   - Fullow-up culture data from OSH
   - Bolus for MAP<65, decreased UOP, worsening mentation.
   .
   # Hypoglycemia/diabetes: FSB 135-190 yesterday.  Patient has been off
   of her home regimen of insulin.  Potential etiologies to hypoglycemia
   include liver failure although unlikely given transaminases, adrenal
   insufficiency, HCC pananeoplastic process, or drug-related.
   - Continue D5 1/2 NS
   - Accuchecks
   - Continue hold ISS and basal insulin for now.

","Based on the provided progress note, Mrs. [**Known lastname 2655**] is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM) who was transferred from another hospital with hypotension, bandemia, hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to sepsis after a recent liver biopsy. 

Key findings from the note include:
- The patient continues to have elevated white blood cell count (WBC) today at 12.5, suggesting ongoing infection.
- The likely source of sepsis is hepatobiliary given recent instrumentation and hepatobiliary pathology as reflected by hyperbilirubinemia.
- The patient is currently receiving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for treatment.
- Further diagnostic tests such as sputum culture, follow-up cultures, and culture data from the previous hospital are pending.
- The patient's blood glucose levels were between 135-190 mg/dL yesterday, indicating that she is not in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS).
- Hypoglycemia could be due to liver failure, adrenal insufficiency, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) panniculopathy, or drug-related causes.
- The patient is receiving dextrose in half normal saline (D5 1/2 NS) to maintain blood sugar levels"

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus who was transferred from another hospital with hypotension, bandemia (low white blood cell count), hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure likely secondary to sepsis after a recent liver biopsy. The patient has been diagnosed with multiple medical conditions including sepsis/hypotension, hypoglycemia/diabetes, UTI (urinary tract infection), hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic failure, acute renal failure, hypertension, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), FEN (nothing by mouth), PPX (prophylactic heparin and PPI), ACCESS (peripheral intravenous line), CODE (code status), and DISPO (disposition).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which may indicate an intravascular hypovolemic component. She continues to have elevated white blood cell count, suggesting ongoing infection. There is a likely source of infection in the hepatobiliary system due to recent instrumentation and underlying hepatobiliary pathology.
2. Hypoglycemia/Diabetes: The patient's blood sugar levels were low, indicating hypoglycemia. This could be due to liver failure, adrenal insufficiency, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) panniculitis, or drug-related causes. Further evaluation is"

   - Pruritus over back since yesterday likely related to
   hyperbilirubinemia. Also developed hives during third unit of FFP,
   transfusion stopped and 25 mg IV benadryl given.
   - Called OSH: Pathology did not reveal tumor and only fibrosis??
   Possible they missed the mass.  Blood cultures NGTD and urine cx
   negative.
   - ERCP: large stricture involving the R hepatic (complete), L hepatic
   partial and the porta hepatis.  Fluro machine was not working properly
   so couldn't evaluate fully.  Placed a plastic stent in the common/right
   biliary duct.  Sent sample for cytology. Did not do sphincterotomy b/c
   INR 2.2.  Can repeat ERCP tomorrow or next day if hyperbili does not
   resolve.  Recommend: repeat FNA (CT-guided) of mass if no dx from OSH
   (waiting for further stains).  If not a surgical candidate can place
   metal stent in the future.
   - ERCP fellow wanted an MRCP for better eval of the mass/stricture.

","Summary:
The patient is a 48-year-old female with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and a recently found liver mass. She was transferred from the outside hospital (OSH) with hypotension, bandemia (low platelet count), hypoglycemia, and acute renal failure (ARF) likely secondary to sepsis after a recent liver biopsy. The patient is currently stable and awaiting identification of the liver mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyperbilirubinemia/hepatic failure/liver mass: The patient has significant hyperbilirubinemia with mixed conjugated/unconjugated picture. There is a right lobe mass that was biopsied, showing no evidence of malignancy (fibrosis/inflammation). The patient underwent an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) yesterday with placement of a plastic stent in the common/right biliary duct. Further evaluation of the biliary tree is needed, possibly through Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) or CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA).
2. Sepsis/hypotension: The patient had hypotension on admission, which may have had an intravascular hypovolemic component. The likely source of infection was hepatobiliary given recent instrumentation. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam) and will continue to be monitored.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient has high sodium levels likely due to intravenous fluids (IVF). A free water deficit of 2.45L has been calculated, and the patient is encouraged to drink water.
4. Hypoglycemia/diabetes: The patient has been off her home regimen of insulin and is experiencing hypoglycemia. Potential etiologies include liver failure, adrenal insufficiency, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) panniculopathy, or drug-related causes. Accuchecks are ordered to monitor blood glucose levels.
5. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient had pyuria on admission, but urine cultures have shown no growth. She is currently on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam).
6. Acute renal failure: The patient had an initial FeNa (fractional excretion of sodium) of 1.9, suggesting acute tubular necrosis (ATN) consistent with hypotension. Creatinine levels are trending down, indicating improvement.
7. Hypertension: Anti-hypertensive medications are being held for now.
8. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): A proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is prescribed.
9. Fluid/electrolyte imbalance: The patient is NPO (nothing by mouth) for now, and repletion as necessary.
10. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is being provided.
11. Lines and access are in place, and the patient's code status is full code."

   24 Hour Events:
 ERCP - At [**2154-9-10**] 05:30 PM
   - Given 4U FFP prior to ERCP today. INR did not change post
   transfusion.
   - Pruritus over back since yesterday likely related to
   hyperbilirubinemia. Also developed hives during third unit of FFP,
   transfusion stopped and 25 mg IV benadryl given.
   - Called OSH: Pathology did not reveal tumor and only fibrosis??
   Possible they missed the mass.  Blood cultures NGTD and urine cx
   negative.
   - ERCP: large stricture involving the R hepatic (complete), L hepatic
   partial and the porta hepatis.  Fluro machine was not working properly
   so couldn't evaluate fully.  Placed a plastic stent in the common/right
   biliary duct.  Sent sample for cytology. Did not do sphincterotomy b/c
   INR 2.2.  Can repeat ERCP tomorrow or next day if hyperbili does not
   resolve.  Recommend: repeat FNA (CT-guided) of mass if no dx from OSH
   (waiting for further stains).  If not a surgical candidate can place
   metal stent in the future.
   - ERCP fellow wanted an MRCP for better eval of the mass/stricture.
   Ordered for tomorrow.
   - ERCP request post-ERCP KUB: contrast in gallbladder and left biliary
   system. no free air. No obstructive bowel gas pattern.
