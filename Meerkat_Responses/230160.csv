","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 26-year-old female who was found down with a bottle of Excedrin PM next to her bed. She was lethargic and had a high heart rate and blood pressure.
- In the emergency department, she received 5 liters of normal saline, was intubated for airway protection, and given N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and bicarbonate.
- She was admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of respiratory failure, tachycardia, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and a suicide attempt.
- The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, peak inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 40%.
- Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.6Â°C, heart rate of 128 beats per minute, blood pressure of 111/71 mmHg, and a SpO2 of 100%.
- Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, potassium levels, lactate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine. Glucose levels are also elevated.
- The patient has been given several medications, including midazolam, dextrose, insulin, quetiapine, and duloxetine.
- The plan includes continuing NAC and bicarbonate, checking daily ECGs, monitoring for osmolar gap, considering organ transplantation, providing a 1:1 sitter, treating metabolic acidosis, and turning off sedation to consider extubation.
- The patient's renal function is being closely monitored, and she is receiving IV fluids.
- Prophylactic measures include boots for deep vein thrombosis prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications:
- Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
- Barotrauma or bronchial rupture due to high peak inspiratory pressures
- Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI)

2. Renal Complications:
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) progression
- Hyperkalemia leading to cardiac arrhythmias
- Uremic encephalopathy

3. Metabolic Complications:
- Metabolic acidosis worsening
- Hypoglycemia due to insulin therapy

4. Cardiovascular Complications:
- Arrhythmias due to electrolyte imbalances
- Myocardial infarction (MI)

5. Infectious Complications:
- Hospital-acquired infections (HAI)
- Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSI)

6. Neurological Complications:
- Seizures due to electrolyte imbalances or drug toxicity
- Delirium or agitation due to sedation or withdrawal symptoms"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who was found down with a bottle of Excedrin next to her bed. She was lethargic and intubated for airway protection. Initial labs showed a Tylenol level of 178, renal failure, acidosis, and coagulopathy. The patient is currently extubated and can converse but is intermittently delirious. She is tremulous, tachycardic, and has clear lung sounds bilaterally. Her abdomen is soft, and she has old and new slashes on her skin indicating self-harm attempts. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was intubated for airway protection, indicating that she had respiratory failure initially. She is now extubated, but there is a concern for ongoing respiratory issues.
2. Tachycardia: The patient's heart rate is elevated, which could be due to various causes such as pain, stress, fever, or medication side effects.
3. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's lab results indicate renal failure, which can be caused by factors like dehydration, medication toxicity, or underlying kidney disease.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has metabolic acidosis, which may be related to the overdose of Tylenol or other underlying conditions.
5. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels are elevated, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias and muscle weakness.

   I saw and examined this pt, and was physically present with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2721**]
   for the key portions of services provided. I would add the following:
   26 yo female with multi-drug ingestion including Tylenol OD, initially
   with acute renal failure, acidosis, acute respiratory failure. She is
   less tremulous though still confused at times. Renal function has
   improved and Tylenol level has decreased to 16. Repeat hct this

   appropriate to go to floor, with continued NAC, 1:1 sitter.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 26-year-old female who was admitted to the ICU with a multi-drug ingestion, including an overdose of Tylenol. She initially presented with acute renal failure, acidosis, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's condition has improved over time, with her renal function showing improvement and the Tylenol level decreasing to 16. She remains delirious at times but is less tremulous. The patient's hemoglobin concentration (hct) has remained unchanged at 27. The healthcare team plans to transfer her to the floor with continued N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and a 1:1 sitter due to concerns about suicide risk.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF): The patient initially presented with acute respiratory failure, which could potentially recur if her respiratory status deteriorates.
2. Renal Failure: The patient initially experienced acute renal failure, which could lead to further complications if kidney function does not fully recover.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient has hyperkalemia (high potassium levels), which can cause cardiac arrhythmias and other complications if not managed properly.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient had metabolic acidosis, which needs to be closely monitored and managed to prevent further complications.
5. Suicidal Behavior: The patient's recent suicide attempt indicates a risk of self-harm. Continuous monitoring and appropriate psychiatric support are necessary to"
