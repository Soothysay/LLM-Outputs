   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Had minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor.
   Additionally, she is likely very intravascularly dry, in addition to
   third-spacing of fluid into abdomen. Received albumin on the floor and
   about 4L fluid total overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]. Also received 1 unit
   pRBC
s, 1 bag platlets and 4 bags FFP. She is afebrile, slightly low
   WBC. Due to low white counts and also some hypothermia, and concern for
   sepsis, antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.
   - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 1 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC and
   improved INR
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - may require central line but could not obtain RIJ overnight [**Date range (1) 7144**]
   despite 3 different operator attempts, flash obtained but not able to
   thread the vessel.
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**], also 1 bag platlets and 4 units
   FFP
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR on therapeutic tap [**4-11**]. Was on
   Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 43. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.7->3.6, likely in
   setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili, elevated but not
   significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant list, with MELD
   score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.8 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine ouptut. Has received 750cc IVF and albumin.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 4L NS overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]).
   - send urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/Cr
   - consider increase midodrine to 7.5mg TID, cont octreotide for
   hepatorenal
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - if becomes worse, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA is positive. Already on vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: Chronic, likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeds (Dobhoff in place)

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Had minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor.
   Additionally, she is likely very intravascularly dry, in addition to
   third-spacing of fluid into abdomen. Received albumin on the floor and
   about 4L fluid total overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]. Also received 1 unit
   pRBC
s, 1 bag platlets and 4 bags FFP. She is afebrile, slightly low
   WBC. Due to low white counts and also some hypothermia, and concern for
   sepsis, antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.
   - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 1 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC and
   improved INR
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - may require central line but could not obtain RIJ overnight [**4-14**]
   despite 3 different operator attempts, flash obtained but not able to
   thread the vessel.
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**], also 1 bag platlets and 4 units
   FFP
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR on therapeutic tap [**4-11**]. Was on
   Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.8 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine ouptut. Has received 750cc IVF and albumin.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 4L NS overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]).
   - send urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/Cr
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA is positive. Already on vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to uremia.
   - Monitor daily bmp
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 43. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.7->3.6, likely in
   setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili, elevated but not
   significantly changed from baseline.
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Hyponatremia: Chronic, likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeds (Dobhoff in place)

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to schistosomiasis, complicated by portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She was admitted for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the MICU for hypotension. The patient received a total of 4 units fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 unit packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and 1 bag platelets. She has been given broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, due to concerns of sepsis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 80/40 mmHg to 86/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Her physical examination shows dry mucous membranes, scleral icterus, Dobhoff tube in place, no oral thrush or ulcers, good dentition, and trace lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and acute kidney injury. The patient has positive guaiac, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She also has hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and chronic anemia. The patient's MELD"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Had minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor.
   Additionally, she is likely very intravascularly dry, in addition to
   third-spacing of fluid into abdomen. Received albumin on the floor and
   about 4L fluid total overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]. Also received 1 unit
   pRBC
s, 1 bag platlets and 4 bags FFP. She is afebrile, slightly low
   WBC. Blood cultures
 bottles growing GPCs in pairs and clusters.
   Antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.
   - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 2 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx. Follow up blood culture
   speciations and sensitivities.
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**].
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR resistant to cipro on therapeutic
   tap [**4-11**]. Was on Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus
   far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 42. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.6->3.2 overnight,
   likely in setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili (36.6),
   elevated but not significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant
   list, with MELD score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.5 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine output, which seems to have improved overnight.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 2.5L IVF and blood products overnight [**4-14**] to [**4-15**]).  Urine lytes
   from [**4-14**] Fe urea 28.25.
   - monitor BUN/Cr
   - continue midodrine at 7.5mg TID, cont octreotide for hepatorenal
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - if worsens, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA was positive on [**4-13**]. Already on
   vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).  Bicarb of 14 today. Anion gap of 15.
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: resolved. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, schistosomiasis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She was admitted for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypotension. The patient has received albumin, intravenous fluids (IVF), packed red blood cells (pRBCs), platelets, and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Her blood cultures showed growth of gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters. Antibiotics were broadened to vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam. She has ongoing concerns of intra-abdominal bleeding, sepsis, acute on chronic anemia, SBP, cirrhosis, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), depression, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal bleeding: The patient's hypotension and recent paracentesis raise concerns for intra-abdominal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is necessary.
2. Sepsis: Given the patient's known infection and low white blood cell count, sepsis remains a concern. Monitoring temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation is essential. Broad-spectrum antibiotics"

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, schistosomiasis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She was admitted for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the MICU for hypotension. The patient has received albumin, fluids, and blood products overnight. She is currently stable with an improved CBC, but remains at risk for intra-abdominal bleeding, sepsis, acute on chronic anemia, SBP, cirrhosis, acute renal failure, UTI, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, GERD, depression, and FEN. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Intra-abdominal bleeding: The patient's history of cirrhosis and recent paracentesis puts her at risk for intra-abdominal bleeding. Close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory parameters is essential.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low WBC count and positive blood cultures indicate a possible infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but ongoing monitoring and assessment for signs of sepsis are necessary.
3. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's guaiac-positive stool and low HCT suggest ongoing blood loss. Active type and screen should be maintained, and additional packed red blood cells (PRBCs) may be required if the HCT drops again.
4. SBP: Although the patient's SBP appears to be controlled with broad-spectrum antibiotics, continued surveillance and follow-up of blood cultures, urine cultures, and asc"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Blood cultures
 bottles growing GPCs in pairs and
   clusters.  Antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.  Had
   minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor. Additionally, she is likely
   very intravascularly dry, in addition to third-spacing of fluid into
   abdomen. She is afebrile, slightly low WBC. - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit
   platelets, 2 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx. Follow up blood culture
   speciations and sensitivities.
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**].
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR resistant to cipro on therapeutic
   tap [**4-11**]. Was on Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus
   far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 42. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.6->3.2 overnight,
   likely in setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili (36.6),
   elevated but not significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant
   list, with MELD score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.5 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine output, which seems to have improved overnight.
   Urine lytes from [**4-14**] Fe urea 28.25, and Na <10 consistent with
   prerenal state.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 2.5L IVF and blood products overnight [**4-14**] to [**4-15**]).  - monitor
   BUN/Cr
   - continue midodrine at 7.5mg TID, cont octreotide for hepatorenal
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - if worsens, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA was positive on [**4-13**]. Already on
   vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).  Bicarb of 14 today. Anion gap of 15.
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: resolved. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Had minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor.
   Additionally, she is likely very intravascularly dry, in addition to
   third-spacing of fluid into abdomen. Received albumin on the floor and
   about 4L fluid total overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]. Also received 1 unit
   pRBC
s, 1 bag platlets and 4 bags FFP. She is afebrile, slightly low
   WBC. Due to low white counts and also some hypothermia, and concern for
   sepsis, antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.
   - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 1 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC and
   improved INR

   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - may require central line but could not obtain RIJ overnight [**Date range (1) 7144**]
   despite 3 different operator attempts, flash obtained but not able to
   thread the vessel.
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**], also 1 bag platlets and 4 units
   FFP
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR on therapeutic tap [**4-11**]. Was on
   Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 43. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.7->3.6, likely in
   setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili, elevated but not
   significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant list, with MELD
   score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.8 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine ouptut. Has received 750cc IVF and albumin.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 4L NS overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]).
   - send urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/Cr
   - consider increase midodrine to 7.5mg TID, cont octreotide for
   hepatorenal
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - if becomes worse, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA is positive. Already on vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: Chronic, likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, lower extremity edema, and schistosomiasis. She was admitted for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the MICU for hypotension. She has multiple medical complications including acute on chronic anemia, acute renal failure, urinary tract infection (UTI), metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), depression, and feeding intolerance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal bleeding: The patient's recent paracentesis and low platelet count increase the risk of bleeding into the abdomen.
2. Sepsis: The patient's low white blood cell count, fever, and infection indicate a possible systemic infection.
3. Hepatorenal syndrome: The patient's elevated creatinine levels and low urine output suggest impaired kidney function secondary to liver disease.
4. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's positive guaiac test and evidence of GI bleeding raise concern for upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient's altered mental status and jaundice may indicate hepatic encephalopathy.
6. Hepatopulmonary syndrome: The patient's low oxygen saturation and history of liver disease suggest the possibility of hepatopulmonary syndrome.
7. Hepatorenal syndrome type 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill individual with a history of cirrhosis of the liver and previous cholecystectomy. They are currently in the ICU and have been experiencing various health issues. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/48 to 81/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient has been receiving multiple medications and treatments, including antibiotics, midodrine, pantoprazole, and nutritional support. They also received a blood transfusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hepatic encephalopathy: Given the patient's history of cirrhosis, there is a risk of hepatic encephalopathy, which is a decline in brain function due to severe liver disease.
2. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics, indicating a possible infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting the antibiotic regimen as necessary is crucial.
3. Bleeding: The patient has received midodrine, which is used to treat hypotension and prevent bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. However, there is still a risk of bleeding complications.
4. Renal failure: The patient's lab results show elevated creatinine levels, suggesting acute renal failure. This requires close monitoring and management.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate episodes"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Blood cultures
 bottles growing GPCs in pairs and
   clusters.  Antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.  Had
   minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor. Additionally, she is likely
   very intravascularly dry, in addition to third-spacing of fluid into
   abdomen. She is afebrile, slightly low WBC. - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit
   platelets, 2 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx. Follow up blood culture
   speciations and sensitivities.
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**].
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs for HCT<25
   - continue to check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR resistant to cipro on therapeutic
   tap [**4-11**]. Was on Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus
   far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 42. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.6->3.2 overnight,
   likely in setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili (36.6),
   elevated but not significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant
   list, with MELD score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.5 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine output, which seems to have improved overnight.
   Urine lytes from [**4-14**] Fe urea 28.25, and Na <10 consistent with
   prerenal state.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 2.5L IVF and blood products overnight [**4-14**] to [**4-15**]).  - monitor
   BUN/Cr
   - consider increasing midodrine dose, octreotide and starting rifaximin
   for potential hepatorenal syndrome
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - if worsens, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # Cardiomegaly:  Heart size appears large on CXR. Most recent echo from
   [**2181-10-20**] unremarkable.
   - Consider repeat echo to eval for pericardial effusion vs. atrial
   dilation
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA was positive on [**4-13**]. Already on
   vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).  Bicarb of 14 today. Anion gap of 15.
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: resolved. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.

","Summary:
The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis and schistosomiasis, admitted for septic shock and transferred to the MICU for hypotension. She has portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 95/48 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient has a positive guaiac test, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. She received 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 unit of platelets, and 2 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) overnight.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Intra-abdominal bleeding: Given the patient's recent paracentesis and presence of ascites, there is concern for intra-abdominal bleeding. The positive guaiac test suggests gastrointestinal bleeding as well.
2. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation of septic shock and positive blood cultures indicate a possible ongoing infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, but the source of infection needs further investigation.
3. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and positive guaiac test suggest acute"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Had minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor.
   Additionally, she is likely very intravascularly dry, in addition to
   third-spacing of fluid into abdomen. Received albumin on the floor and
   about 4L fluid total overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]. Also received 1 unit
   pRBC
s, 1 bag platlets and 4 bags FFP. She is afebrile, slightly low
   WBC. Due to low white counts and also some hypothermia, and concern for
   sepsis, antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.
   - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 1 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC and
   improved INR
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**], also 1 bag platlets and 4 units
   FFP
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs if hct drops again
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR on therapeutic tap [**4-11**]. Was on
   Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 43. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.7->3.6, likely in
   setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili, elevated but not
   significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant list, with MELD
   score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.8 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine ouptut. Has received 750cc IVF and albumin.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 4L NS overnight [**4-13**] to [**4-14**]).
   - send urine lytes
   - monitor BUN/Cr
   - consider increase midodrine to 7.5mg TID, cont octreotide for
   hepatorenal
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - if becomes worse, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA is positive. Already on vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: Chronic, likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.
   - Nutrition consult for tube feeds (Dobhoff in place)
   # Prophylaxis: Pneumoboots, PPI

","Summary:
The patient is a chronically ill appearing, tired, and jaundiced Portuguese-speaking individual. They have a history of allergies to apples, peaches, pears, and an unknown allergy causing anaphylaxis. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has undergone various tests and treatments. Notably, the patient's blood cultures were taken on 04/15/2182 at 12:27 PM, a trans thoracic echo was performed on the same day at 01:00 PM, and a urine culture was done at 04:15 PM. The patient's HCT levels have fluctuated between 26.7 and 28.5. The echo revealed normal left ventricular size and ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was discharged from vancomycin but requires redosing based on the AM trough. Peritoneal fluid is growing E. coli, and the patient is recommended to be on albumin 50g daily for hepatorenal syndrome. Octreotide was decreased to 100 due to some abdominal pain.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The presence of E. coli growth in the peritoneal fluid suggests a possible infection. It is crucial to monitor and treat the infection appropriately to prevent its progression and potential sepsis.

2. Hepatorenal Syndrome: The patient's"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Blood cultures
 bottles growing GPCs in pairs and
   clusters.  Antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.  Had
   minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor. Additionally, she is likely
   very intravascularly dry, in addition to third-spacing of fluid into
   abdomen. She is afebrile, slightly low WBC. - s/p 4 units FFP, 1 unit
   platelets, 2 unit pRBC
s, now stable CBC
   - cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx. Follow up blood culture
   speciations and sensitivities.
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**].
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs for HCT<25
   - continue to check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - correct coagulopathy with FFP as needed
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR resistant to cipro on therapeutic
   tap [**4-11**]. Was on Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus
   far.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**])
   - F/u speciation, sensitivities of peritoneal fluid culture
   - f/u urine cx and blood cx as above
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 42. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. INR went up from 2.6->3.2 overnight,
   likely in setting of cirrhosis and infection. LFTs, T bili (36.6),
   elevated but not significantly changed from baseline. Is on transplant
   list, with MELD score of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.5 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine output, which seems to have improved overnight.
   Urine lytes from [**4-14**] Fe urea 28.25, and Na <10 consistent with
   prerenal state.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 2.5L IVF and blood products overnight [**4-14**] to [**4-15**]).  - monitor
   BUN/Cr
   - consider increasing midodrine dose, octreotide and starting rifaximin
   for potential hepatorenal syndrome
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - if worsens, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # Cardiomegaly:  Heart size appears large on CXR. Most recent echo from
   [**2181-10-20**] unremarkable.
   - Consider repeat echo to eval for pericardial effusion vs. atrial
   dilation
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA was positive on [**4-13**]. Already on
   vanc/zosyn
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).  Bicarb of 14 today. Anion gap of 15.
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: resolved. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa
   # FEN: clears for now given n/v, advance as tolerated.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to schistosomiasis and portal hypertension. She was admitted for suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the MICU for hypotension. The patient has multiple medical complications and comorbidities.

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which could be due to intra-abdominal bleeding or sepsis. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, and she received fluid boluses and blood products. Monitoring of vital signs and hemodynamic parameters is essential.

2. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, indicating acute anemia on top of chronic anemia. She has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, as indicated by guaiac-positive stool. Further evaluation and management are required, including transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) as needed.

3. SBP: The patient has positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods (GNR) resistant to ciprofloxacin. She was already on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. The patient's SBP appears to be well-managed with the current antibiotic regimen.

4. Cirrhosis: The patient has advanced cirrhosis with a MELD score of 42, indicating severe liver dysfunction. She also has portal gastropathy and esophageal varices. Lactulose and"

   Assessment and Plan
   39yo female with cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis complicated by portal
   hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema,
   admitted for SBP and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.
   # SBP: Positive 2/2 bottles for GNR resistant to cipro on therapeutic
   tap [**4-11**]. Was on Cipro prophylaxis. Afebrile at home and here thus
   far.  Culture shows e.coli sensitive to zosyn.  BCx x 1 with GPCs in
   pairs and clusters.
   - cont vanc and zosyn
   - Albumin 1.5g/kg x 1 given [**4-13**], then 1g/kg x 1 to be given on Day 3
   ([**4-15**]), then  albumin 50g
   - f/u speciation of blood cx as above
   # Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of
   recent para. Also would have high suspicion for sepsis in the setting
   of known infection. Blood cultures
 bottles growing GPCs in pairs and
   clusters.  Antibiotics were broadened on [**4-13**] to vanc/zosyn.  Had
   minimal response to IVF bolus on the floor. Additionally, she is likely
   very intravascularly dry, in addition to third-spacing of fluid into
   abdomen. Has received 4 units FFP, 1 unit platelets, 2 unit pRBC
s over
   hospitalization.
    She is afebrile, slightly low WBC, pressures now stable x 48 hours. -
   cont to monitor cbc, coags, and replete as needed
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, ascites fluid cx. Follow up blood culture
   speciations and sensitivities.
   - cont vanc, zosyn
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - maintain [**1-22**] large bore IVS
   - IVF bolus prn to maintain MAP>65, UOP>30cc/h
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone
   # Acute on chronic anemia: She is guaiac positive. Her hct is below her
   baseline. There is concern that she could be bleeding into her abdomen
   and also has evidence of GI bleeding by guaiac positive stool. She
   received 1 unit pRBC
s overnight [**4-14**]. Crit stable at 28.5 this am.
   - maintain active type and screen
   - transfuse additional pRBCs for HCT<25
   - continue to check HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   # Cirrhosis: Patient has cirrhosis [**1-21**] schistosomiasis. She is
   currently on the transplant list. MELD is 42. Also has grade I and II
   varices and portal gastropathy. Is on transplant list, with MELD score
   of 40 (max).
   - Continue lactulose, PPI
   - Hold Nadolol, Spironolactone given hypotension
   - Monitor daily LFTs, coags
   - vit K 5mg daily x3 doses
   # Acute renal failure: Cr baseline around 0.8. Last Cr in OMR prior to
   admission was 1.2 in outpt setting, now 2.0 which is down from peak of
   3.5. Likely [**1-21**] dehydration given low recent PO intake with infection.
   Has also had low urine output on first 24 hours admission, now
   improved. Urine lytes from [**4-14**] Fe urea 28.25, and Na <10 consistent
   with prerenal state.
   Concern for hepatorenal but renal function did improve with IVF (got
   about 2.5L IVF and blood products overnight [**4-14**] to [**4-15**]).  - monitor
   BUN/Cr
   - continue midodrine, decrease octreotide, albumin 50g daily
   - monitor UOP (has foley in place)
   - obtain vanc trough given changing renal function
   - if worsens, will consult renal as patient may require bridge
   dialysis/CVVH until liver transplant
   # Cardiomegaly:  Heart size appears large on CXR. Most recent echo from
   [**2181-10-20**] unremarkable.
   - nl LV size and EF. mild MR, TR
   # UTI: No urinary symptoms but UA was positive on [**4-13**]. Already on
   vanc/zosyn
   - UCx: NGTD
   # Metabolic acidosis: Bicarb 13 on admit, likely secondary to renal
   disease (uremia, high phos).  Bicarb of 17 today.
   - Monitor daily BMP
   - Treating underlying infection
   # Hyponatremia: resolved. Likely secondary to cirrhosis.  Improved with
   IVF.
   - IVF, albumin given as above
   - Hold spironolactone
   - Continue to trend
   # GERD: Continue PPI
   # Depression: continue Celexa

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis due to schistosomiasis, complicated by portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, and lower extremity edema. She was admitted for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and transferred to the MICU for hypotension.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. SBP: Positive blood culture for Gram-negative rods resistant to ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She was already on ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. The blood cultures also showed growth of Gram-positive cocci in pairs and clusters.
2. Hypotension: Concern for intra-abdominal bleeding in the setting of recent paracentesis. There is also suspicion of sepsis due to known infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated, and the patient received intravenous fluids (IVF) bolus, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, and packed red blood cells (pRBCs).
3. Acute on chronic anemia: The patient is guaiac positive, indicating possible gastrointestinal bleeding. Her hemoglobin level is below her baseline, and she received a unit of pRBCs overnight. The critical stable hemoglobin level is 28.5%.
4. Cirrhosis: The patient has cirrhosis due to schistosomias"

She was admitted for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and hypotension, and transferred to the MICU. The patient's recent events include positive blood cultures for gram-negative rods resistant to ciprofloxacin, but sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and Zosyn. The patient also has evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, acute renal failure, hepatorenal syndrome, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, and depression. She is on the transplant list with a MELD score of 40.
