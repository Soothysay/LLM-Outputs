   Assessment and Plan
   69F with hypoxemic respiratory distress
   Respiratory distress: Likely a mixed picture, CTPA negative for PE or
   any parenchymal abnormality, but does show tracheobronchial malacia.
   PFTs show severe restrictive lung disease, and distended abdomen is
   also contributing to this.  Her exam is also c/w underlying obstruction
   as she is breathing through pursed lips and has wheezes.  Also may have
   some underlying OSA.
   -TTE with a bubble study to evaluate for a PFO
   -Prednisone at 60mg daily
   -Albuterol and ipatropium nebs
   -considering a trial of NPPV
    Leukocytosis: in the setting of a positive urinalysis
   -Treating with cipro
   -Await cultures and sensitivities
   Transaminitis: Likely due to underlying liver mass (?metastatic lesion)
   -Continue to monitor
   Elevated CK: Normal cardiac isoenzymes, in the setting of a fall,
   adequately fluid resuscitated
   -continue to monitor
   DM: On a high dose of 70/30 at home
   -ISS for now, add back home regimen as needed
   Bony pain: likely from bony metastatic lesions
   -NSAIDS/toradol prn, avoiding sedating meds
   Breast mass: Head CT negative, with ? mets to bone and liver
   -WIll need a tissue diagnosis via either IR vs. surgery
   HTN:
   -Holding  lisinopril
   #  Psych: continue outpt meds.
   - Mild confusion: check CT head to r/o mets to brain.
   - Code status: DNR/DNI per prior documented discussions

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with hypoxia and an incidentally discovered breast mass. She presented with respiratory distress, which is believed to be a mixed picture including tracheobronchial malacia. The patient also has severe restrictive lung disease and a distended abdomen contributing to her condition. She is breathing through pursed lips and has wheezes, indicating underlying obstruction. There are suspicions of underlying obstructive sleep apnea as well.

The patient has been given bisacodyl suppository for decompression due to dilated loops of large bowel consistent with obstruction or ileus. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure, normal heart rate, and decreased oxygen saturation at 91%. She is on supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula.

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, codeine, and sulfonamides. She is currently receiving prophylactic heparin sodium, ciprofloxacin, prednisone, nebulizers, and psych medications.

Recent changes to her medical and family history include the discovery of a breast mass, profound abdominal distention, and bony pain, which is suspected to be from bony metastatic lesions. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for respiratory distress.

Flow sheet data shows that the patient has received fluid resuscitation, with a total input of 296 mL in the past 24 hours. She has received 240 mL of PO, 67 mL of TF, and 56 mL of IVF. Her output has been 67 mL of urine and 0 mL of blood products. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula, with an ABG indicating a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 55 mmHg, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SO2) of 91%.

Physical examination reveals an overweight/obese appearance, breathing through pursed lips, normal pupils, normal heart sounds without murmurs, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with wheezes, profound abdominal distention, and warm skin without rash. Neurologic examination shows attentive behavior, purposeful movement, and normal tone.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) at 21.6 K/uL, hematocrit (Hct) at 27.5%, platelet count (Plt) at 593 K/uL, and other labs including ALT/AST at 52/56, alkaline phosphatase/total bilirubin at 238/0.3, lactic acid at 1.2 mmol/L, and creatine kinase (CK) at 364. Imaging shows multiple dilated loops of large bowel consistent with obstruction or ileus.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and several other medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information given are as follows:

1. Respiratory distress: The patient has multifactorial hypoxemia, which means her low oxygen levels have multiple causes. These include tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, and splinting from pain. The CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and the echocardiogram was negative for patent foramen ovale (PFO).

2. Urinary tract infection (UTI): The patient has leukocytosis with a positive urine analysis (UA), suggesting a possible UTI. She is currently on day 3 of ciprofloxacin.

3. Breast mass: The patient has a breast mass that may be metastatic breast cancer with lesions in the liver and bone. This is supported by elevated liver enzymes and GGT. Palliative care has been initiated, and she has consented for an IR-guided breast biopsy. Additionally, an IR-guided liver biopsy is planned today, considering her INR of 1.2.

4. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's urine osmolality is elevated, with normal urine sodium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and has experienced several medical complications during her stay in the ICU. These complications include respiratory distress due to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, abdominal distention, and splinting from pain. The patient also has a urinary tract infection, likely causing leukocytosis with positive urine analysis. She has breast masses with suspected metastatic breast cancer, with lesions in the liver and bone. There are elevated liver enzymes and GGT, and the patient has consented for an IR-guided breast biopsy. Additionally, the patient has acute renal failure, elevated CPK levels, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and schizoaffective disorder.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, abdominal distention, and splinting from pain. This can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for mechanical ventilation.
2. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The positive urine analysis suggests a UTI, which if left untreated, can lead to systemic infection and sepsis.
3. Breast Cancer Metastasis: The presence of breast masses with suspected metastatic"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder. She was admitted to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver metastases. 

The patient's primary issues include respiratory distress, no evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA), but she continues to have a large A-a gradient of unclear etiology. The possible causes of her respiratory distress include total body malignancy with lymphangitic spread, restrictive lung disease with significant abdominal distention, mild carbon dioxide retention with wheezes on examination, probable obstructive sleep apnea with macroglossia, neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome (though without carbon dioxide elevation), and diaphragmatic involvement. The patient also has a concern for possible splinting from rib fracture and chest pain.

The plan for the patient includes noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) as needed, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) with bubble study, bowel regimen for abdominal distention, empiric steroids for wheezing, nebulizers, and palliative service following. 

The patient's other conditions include acute renal failure (ARF), leukocytosis, sternal pain likely from bony metast"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder.
- She was found to be hypoxemic following a fall and has a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver metastases.
- The patient has been experiencing respiratory distress without evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) on computed tomography angiography (CTA).
- Her vital signs are stable, but she has mild carbon dioxide retention and wheezing on examination.
- Possible causes for her respiratory distress include tension pneumothorax, restrictive lung disease, abdominal distention, obstructive sleep apnea with macroglossia, neuromuscular weakness from a paraneoplastic syndrome, or diaphragmatic involvement.
- The patient also has leukocytosis and abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) likely due to liver and bone metastases.
- She has a history of diabetes mellitus and is being treated with non-insulin protocol (NPH).
- The patient's pain management plan includes avoiding nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to renal fracture and using Tylenol for pain.
- Her oncology plan involves further evaluation of the breast mass, which is likely metastatic based on radiologic findings.
- The patient has acute renal failure (ARF) and is receiving gentle hydration with maintenance intravenous fluids (IVF"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer presenting with multifactorial hypoxemia. The patient underwent a liver biopsy, which showed stable hematocrit levels afterward. She was changed to PO steroids and tolerated oral intake without any issues. The patient also received IV morphine for pain, but it had little effect on her respiratory status. Oncology consult is pending tissue results, and palliative care agrees with IV morphine for pain control. Outpatient Psych wants to discuss and deliver the diagnosis when pathology returns. The patient experienced increasing tachypnea overnight, maintaining sats in the low 90s but with wheezes and poor air movement. ABG results showed pH 7.39, PaCO2 51 mmHg, and PaO2 75 mmHg. CXR showed no change, and nebs were increased to q3H standing.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory distress: The patient has multifactorial hypoxemia and is experiencing respiratory distress. This could be due to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, or splinting from pain. The CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and the echo was negative for patent foramen ovale (PFO). The patient required an increase in nebulizer frequency overnight with"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has several significant medical conditions including a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver lesions. She also has an elevated white blood cell count and lactic acid level, indicating possible infection or tissue hypoperfusion.

The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous and is likely multifactorial, with potential causes such as thoracic cage mass, restrictive lung disease, abdominal distention, mild carbon dioxide retention, probable obstructive sleep apnea with macroglossia, neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome, or diaphragmatic involvement. The patient's respiratory distress may be worsened by splinting from the rib fracture and chest pain.

The patient's oncologic assessment reveals a likely metastatic breast mass, with tumor markers elevated and a liver biopsy pending. The patient is also experiencing sternal pain likely due to bony metastases or rib fracture, for which morphine has been prescribed. Other medical issues include acute renal failure (pre-renal), leukocytosis/urinary tract infection, abnormal liver function tests (likely secondary to liver and bone metastases), uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and psychiatric disorders.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU with hypoxemic respiratory distress. The workup revealed no pulmonary embolism but showed a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver metastasis. The patient has been experiencing increasing tachypnea overnight and is wheezy, with nebs increased to Q 3 hours. She remains stable with liver biopsy done, awaiting pathology results, and tumor markers pending. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, codeine, and sulfonamides. She is currently on several medications including pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, and others. Her review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs show sinus tachycardia and low oxygen saturation. Her physical examination reveals wheezing on chest examination. Lab results indicate leukocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, and other abnormalities. Imaging shows no acute changes in the chest X-ray. The patient's assessment includes respiratory distress likely multifactorial, advanced malignancy with possible lymphangitic spread, acute renal failure pre-renal type improving with hydration, leukocytosis, sternal pain from bony metastasis/rib fracture, abnormal liver function tests, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and psychosocial issues. The plan includes respiratory support, evaluation"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemic respiratory distress. The patient's medical workup revealed no pulmonary embolism but did show a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver metastases. The patient underwent a liver biopsy, with pending pathology results, and tumor markers were sent to oncology.

The patient's current condition includes tachypnea with wheezing, oxygen dependency through a nasal cannula, and an ABG showing a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 51, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 750. Physical examination findings include obesity, tachypnea, symmetric chest expansion, no adventitious breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Neurologic examination was not performed due to movement assessment.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL, elevated platelet count of 593, and various abnormalities in electrolyte levels and liver function tests. Imaging showed a small volume chest X-ray with no acute changes.

   Imaging: CT chest
   1. Suboptimal study for evaluation of tracheobronchial malacia due to
   poor
   inspiratory effort. The tracheobronchial tree is relatively collapsed
   in both inspiration and expiration phase of imaging. There are no
   obvious endotracheal or endobronchial lesions.
   2. Right hilar and right axillary adenopathy with right breast mass as
   previously described. There are also multiple lucent lesions involving
   the
   left humeral head, lower cervical vertebral bodies, and right-sided
   ribs,
   which may indicate osseous metastases from a potential breast
   carcinoma. A bone scan for further evaluation of extent of osseous
   metastases is recommended.
   3. Multiple low-attenuation hepatic lesions, incompletely evaluated in
   the
   non-contrast setting. These may represent metastatic lesions and
   further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced scan is recommended. Please
   note that these lesions were not readily apparent on the study from
   yesterday due to early arterial phase of imaging in a dedicated PE
   protocol as well as incomplete coverage of the liver in the
   contrast-enhanced sections.
   4. There is no definite evidence of lymphangitic tumor spread; however,
   the evaluation of the pulmonary parenchyma and interlobular septa are
   significantly limited due to respiratory motion.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and several other medical conditions including diabetes, hypertension, schizophrenia, and a history of pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been on various medications including morphine for pain control, pantoprazole, heparin, and insulin for glycemic control. She is also receiving IV fluids and has been placed on a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 144/57 to 157/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia. 

Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, elevated glucose level, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging studies reveal right hilar and axillary adenopathy, right breast mass, multiple lucent lesions in the left humeral head, lower cervical vertebral bodies, and right-sided ribs, which may indicate osseous metastases from potential breast carcinoma. Additionally, there are multiple low-attenuation hepatic lesions that may represent metastatic lesions.

The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, likely multifactorial, but continues to have a high A-a gradient.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Respiratory Distress:
   - Multifactorial causes including possible tumor-related myopathy (TBM), restrictive lung disease, mild CO2 retention, probable obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with macroglossia.
   - Consider dedicated tracheal CT to better assess TBM, consider interventional pulmonology (IP) consult, consider trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV).
   - Elevate head of bed to assist with breathing and abdominal distention/restriction.
   - Bowel regimen for abdominal distention.
   - Empiric steroids (pursed lip breathing, wheeze) - continue 40 prednisone without wean at this time, as still wheezy.
   - Nebulizer treatments increased to q3h.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder. She was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient has several comorbidities including a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver lesions. Preliminary results of a liver biopsy indicate metastatic breast cancer. The patient also has an elevated white blood cell count, leukocytosis, and an altered mental status. She is receiving morphine sulfate for pain management and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.6 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 101 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 97/67 mmHg to 157/69 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94%, and sinus tachycardia. The patient's arterial blood gas shows a pH of 7.32, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 67 mmHg, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 39 mmHg. The patient's laboratory results indicate anemia, elevated blood glucose levels, elevated creatinine levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has pitting edema, poor air movement in the chest, and inspiratory and expiratory wheez"

   1. Respiratory distress: Multifactorial: tracheobronchial malacia,
   restrictive/obstructive lung dz, OSA, abdominal distention, splinting
   from pain, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to lung.  CT negative
   for PE, Echo negative for PFO.  Dedicated CT to evaluate TBM and
   lymphangitic spread was not optimal due to poor inspiratory effort,
   however, it did show multiple ?bony mets but no lymphangitic spread.
   Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.  VBG today 7.32/67/39
   - Respiratory status is worsening.
   - At this time, plan for Bipap when sleeping, and overnight with
   NC/face mask during the day
   - Reposition patient
 OOB to chair daily, position on side when
   sleeping given abdominal pannus
   - Continue nebs, and no change in steroid dose for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The respiratory distress is attributed to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, and possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. Imaging studies show multiple bony metastases but no lymphangitic spread. Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful. The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she requires non-invasive ventilation support. She also has a urinary tract infection (UTI), which will be treated with a course of ciprofloxacin. Preliminary pathology results indicate metastatic breast cancer to the liver and bone. The patient's pain is managed with IV morphine, and she has a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), schizoaffective disorder, and poor nutritional intake. She is currently on a DNR/DNI code status and is being considered for discharge to a specific hospital ward.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial and can worsen due to the underlying conditions such as tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, OSA, abdominal distention, and possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs.

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia, respiratory distress, and other medical conditions. The patient has been on non-invasive ventilation but was recently taken off it. She has been trialed on BIPAP with good success. The patient's allergies include penicillins, codeine, and sulfonamides. She has been prescribed various medications including heparin sodium for prophylaxis, methylprednisolone, and lisinopril. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.9 C (98.5 F), heart rate of 98 bpm, blood pressure of 151/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's blood work reveals elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as abnormal kidney function tests. Imaging shows cardiac size within normal limits, tortuous aorta, and atelectasis in both lung lobes. The patient's microbiology results are negative for bacterial infections. The assessment and plan include treating respiratory distress, urinary tract infection, breast mass, leukocytosis, pain, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and schizoaffective disorder. The patient has a code status of DNR/DNI and will be discussed with palliative care."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. She has a history of breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver lesions. The patient was started on non-invasive ventilation and later transitioned to invasive mechanical ventilation. She is also being treated for a urinary tract infection with ciprofloxacin. The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, likely due to multiple factors including obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer, neuromuscular weakness from a paraneoplastic syndrome, and diaphragmatic involvement. The plan includes providing respiratory support, improving blood oxygenation, managing pain, and preparing for chemotherapy next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory status is described as tenuous, indicating a high risk for further respiratory complications. This could include worsening hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and potential respiratory failure.
2. Lymphangitic Spread of Cancer: There is concern for lymphangitic spread of breast cancer, which can lead to progressive respiratory compromise and respiratory distress.
3. Neuromuscular Weakness: The possibility of neuromuscular weakness from a paraneoplastic syndrome raises concerns for respiratory muscle weakness and subsequent respiratory compromise.
4. Diaphragmatic Involvement"

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU with respiratory distress and hypoxemia. She has a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture (lytic lesions), and liver lesions. The patient's vital signs are stable, but she is tachypneic. Her oxygen saturation is 91% on nasal cannula. She has a high arterial-alveolar gradient and is not ruling out lymphangitic spread of cancer. The patient's respiratory distress has worsened this morning and appears to be multifactorial. There are concerns for possible neuromuscular weakness from a paraneoplastic syndrome, diaphragmatic involvement, and splinting from the rib fracture. Increased CO2 retention with altered mental status is also noted. The patient will start bipap today and follow up with mental status/VBG. 

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's respiratory distress is worsening and appears to be multifactorial, including COPD, TBM (not amenable to Rx in acute setting), obesity, OSA, known restrictive lung disease, likely lymphangitic spread of cancer, macroglossia, neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome, diaphragmatic involvement, and splinting from rib fracture.

   # Resp distress:
   Appears to be multifactorial:  no ev of pe on cta. Has COPD, TBM (not
   amenable to Rx in acute setting), obesity, OSA,  known restrictive lung
   disease, likely lymphangitic spread of Ca (no way to diagnose),
   macroglossia.
   ? neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome (w  CO2
   elevation) ? diaphragmatic involvement (hard to assess abd movt due to
   distention)
   ? splinting from rib f x, chest pain likely contributing
   Concerned also for possible lymphangitic spread from what appears to be
   advanced malignancy, (though not obvious per recent ct chest)
   -- Improved with bipap yesterday. Will get her on a nightly and nap
   regimen.
   -- hob elevated to assist with breathing and abd distention/restriction
   -- continue iv steroids, nebs for CO2 retention
   -- morphine for rib pain as splinting likely contribtuing, start low

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU for hypoxemia and respiratory distress. She has several comorbidities including a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver lesions. The patient was previously on non-invasive ventilation but was successfully weaned off it. She is currently on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery device with an SpO2 of 91%. The ABG results show a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 49, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 122.

The patient's physical examination revealed an overweight and obese appearance with tachypnea, poor air movement, and wheezes. There was also evidence of pitting edema. The neurological examination showed that the patient was attentive, followed simple commands, and responded to verbal stimuli.

Laboratory results indicated anemia with a hemoglobin level of 8.0 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 21.6 K/uL. Other lab values showed elevated blood glucose levels, increased lactate levels, and abnormalities in electrolytes and liver function tests. Imaging studies revealed pulmonary edema and discoid atelectasis on chest X-ray.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient's respiratory distress is likely multifactorial, with possible"

   1. Respiratory distress: Multifactorial: tracheobronchial malacia,
   restrictive/obstructive lung dz, OSA, abdominal distention, splinting
   from pain, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to lung.  CT negative
   for PE, Echo w/o bubble study.  Dedicated CT to evaluate TBM and
   lymphangitic spread was not optimal due to poor inspiratory effort,
   however, it did show multiple ?bony mets but no lymphangitic spread.
   Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.  VBG today 7.32/67/39
   - Respiratory status is improved this AM after 18 hours Bipap yesterday
 continue BiPap overnight, and NC/face tent during the day
   - Started lovenox yesterday empirically but will d/c today as negative
   CTA and negative LENI.
   - Continue to keep net out 500-1L daily.
   - At this time, plan for Bipap when sleeping, and overnight with
   NC/face mask during the day
   - Reposition patient
 OOB to chair daily, position on side when
   sleeping given abdominal pannus
   - Continue nebs, and taper steroids today given COPD is ?diagnosis and
   patient w/o wheezing on exam for 48 hours.
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   - Pain control with morphine
   .
   2. Breast mass: Preliminary pathology showing metastatic breast CA to
   the liver and bone.  CEA, CA 27.29 elevated, CA [**15**]-9 wnl.
   -Await final results of liver biopsy, likely tuesday
   -Family meeting today at 11am to discuss goals of care.  No hard
   evidence for lymphangitis spread of tumor and given tenuous status will
   likely opt for normal chemotherapy rather than aggressive chemo.
   -Palliative care following

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and several medical complications. Here is a summary of the patient's condition and potential medical complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has respiratory distress due to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, splinting from pain, and possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. A computed tomography (CT) scan was negative for pulmonary embolism (PE), and an echocardiogram (Echo) without bubble study did not show evidence of PE either. However, the CT scan did reveal multiple bony metastases but no lymphangitic spread. The induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.

2. Breast Mass: Preliminary pathology results indicate metastatic breast cancer to the liver and bone. The patient is awaiting final results of a liver biopsy, likely on Tuesday. A family meeting has been scheduled to discuss the goals of care. It is planned to opt for normal chemotherapy rather than aggressive chemotherapy due to the tenuous status of the patient.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis in the setting of steroids, infectious workup unrevealing, and no fevers. The urine analysis (Ua) shows a few leuk's and"

   Assessment and Plan
   69F with new dx of metastatic breast CA presents with  multifactorial
   hypoxemia
   .
   1. Respiratory distress: Multifactorial: tracheobronchial malacia,
   restrictive/obstructive lung dz, OSA, abdominal distention, splinting
   from pain, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to lung.  CT negative
   for PE, Echo negative for PFO.  Dedicated CT to evaluate TBM and
   lymphangitic spread was not optimal due to poor inspiratory effort,
   however, it did show multiple ?bony mets but no lymphangitic spread.
   Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.  VBG today 7.32/67/39
   - Respiratory status is worsening.
   - At this time, plan for Bipap when sleeping, and overnight with
   NC/face mask during the day
   - Reposition patient
 OOB to chair daily, position on side when
   sleeping given abdominal pannus
   - Continue nebs, and no change in steroid dose for now
   - Aggressive bowel regimen
   - Pain control with morphine
   .
   2. Breast mass: Preliminary pathology showing metastatic breast CA to
   the liver and bone.  CEA, CA 27.29 elevated, CA [**15**]-9 wnl.
   -Await final results of liver biopsy, likely tuesday
   -Will involve onc when there is a tissue dx
   -Palliative care following
   .
   3. Leukocytosis: in the setting of steroids, infectious w/u otherwise
   unrevealing, no fevers.
   - Ua dirty, but with few leuk's and WBC's. -> completed course of cipro
   yesterday.
   -continue to monitor
   .
   4. Pain: per palliative care recs, getting IV morphine with good result
   -continue IV morphine, change tylenol to standing.
   .
   5. DM
   -Increased home regimen of NPH 78 qam, 42 qpm for increasing ISS needs
   during the day

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The possible causes of her respiratory distress include tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, splinting from pain, and potential lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed multiple bony metastases but no lymphangitic spread. Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.

The patient's respiratory status is worsening, and she requires supplemental oxygen. She will be placed on BiPAP when sleeping and an NC/face mask during the day. Repositioning the patient and providing pain control with morphine are also part of the plan.

In terms of her breast mass, preliminary pathology indicates metastatic breast cancer to the liver and bone. CEA, CA 27.29 levels are elevated, while CA 15-9 is within normal limits. Final results of the liver biopsy are pending, and the involvement of oncology will depend on obtaining a tissue diagnosis. Palliative care will be involved subsequently.

The patient also has leukocytosis, possibly related to steroid use, and an infectious workup is ongoing. Her pain management plan involves IV morphine, which has been effective. 

Additionally, the patient"

These findings suggest advanced malignancy, possibly breast cancer with metastasis.

The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial and includes potential causes such as obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), restrictive lung disease, lymphangitic spread of cancer, neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome, diaphragmatic involvement, and splinting from the rib fracture. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is currently at 95% on aerosol-cool delivery, and arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 35 mmHg.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 18.4 thousand cells/mm³, elevated hemoglobin (Hct) levels, and elevated platelet count. Liver function tests (LFTs) are abnormal with elevated liver enzymes. Other lab values including blood glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function tests are within normal range.

The patient has been started on noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or biPAP, which has improved her respiratory"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who was admitted to the ICU for hypoxemia and respiratory distress. She has a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver lesions. The patient's respiratory distress is multifactorial, including obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, restrictive lung disease, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer, neuromuscular weakness from paraneoplastic syndrome, diaphragmatic involvement, and splinting from rib fracture. There is concern for possible pulmonary embolism despite negative CT angiogram and low likelihood of embolism evaluation (LENS) scores. The patient also has a concern for patent foramen ovale.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory status: The patient's respiratory status remains tenuous, likely multifactorial, and continues to have a high A-a gradient, making it difficult to rule out lymphangitic spread of cancer. The patient appears to be improving with bipap and will be placed on a nightly and nap regimen. Autodiuresis and input/output balance will be maintained, and a bowel regimen will be implemented to decompress the abdomen.
2. Oncology: The patient has a breast mass with axillary nodes, rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver metastases. Preliminary pathology on liver biopsy is positive for breast cancer."

","The patient is a 69-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and schizoaffective disorder who presented to the ICU for hypoxemia and respiratory distress. She has a large right breast mass with axillary nodes, a rib fracture with lytic lesions, and liver lesions. The patient's respiratory distress has improved with the use of bipap, but there are concerns about worsening shunt fraction, possible pulmonary embolism despite negative CT angiography, possible patent foramen ovale, and bipap leak.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 131/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is alert and oriented, with good air movement in the lungs, although wheezing is present. There is also evidence of pitting edema and warm skin.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated levels of C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Liver function tests are abnormal, with elevated ALT and AST levels. Urinalysis shows leukocytes and white blood cells. Tumor markers are also elevated, indicating possible metastatic breast cancer.

   - Respiratory status is improved somewhat with Bipap
 continue BiPap
   overnight, and NC/face tent during the day
   ---currently on BiPAP and minimally responsive. ABG done shows
   7.43/61/81 on BiPAP 14/8 on 6L. pH normal suggests this is not an acute
   rise in CO2- (venous gases showed CO2 in the mid 50 range recently).
   Did not go on BiPAP until 5am today for unclear reasons.  Will write to
   keep BiPAP on from at least 10pm until 7am daily.
   - Continue to keep net out 500-1L daily.
   - Reposition patient

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress, possibly due to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, and potential lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. A CT scan did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism (PE), but there were multiple bony metastases. An echocardiogram with bubble study is pending to evaluate for shunting. The patient has been placed on BiPAP and NC/face tent to improve respiratory status. She is minimally responsive and currently on BiPAP.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Distress: The patient has multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The underlying causes may include tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, OSA, abdominal distention, and possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. Continuous monitoring and management of her respiratory status are necessary.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis in the setting of steroids, with an infectious workup that remains unrevealing and no fevers. This could be due to an ongoing infection or steroid-induced leukocytosis. Regular monitoring and follow-up cultures are recommended.
3. Pain Management: The patient requires pain management"

   #. Respiratory distress: Multifactorial: tracheobronchial malacia,
   restrictive/obstructive lung dz, OSA, abdominal distention, splinting
   from pain, possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to lung.  CT negative
   for PE, Echo w/o bubble study pending for today to evaluate for
   shunting (significant A-a gradient on blood gases).  Dedicated CT to
   evaluate TBM and lymphangitic spread was not optimal due to poor
   inspiratory effort, however, it did show multiple bony mets but no
   obvious sign of lymphangitic spread.  Induced sputum for cytology was
   unsuccessful.
   - Respiratory status is improved somewhat with Bipap
 continue BiPap
   overnight, and NC/face tent during the day
   ---currently ABG done shows 7.43/61/81 on BiPAP 14/8 on 6L. pH normal
   suggests this is not an acute rise in CO2- (venous gases showed CO2 in
   the mid 50 range recently). Did not go on BiPAP until 5am today for
   unclear reasons.  Will write to keep BiPAP on from at least 10pm until
   7am daily.
   - Continue to keep net out 500-1L daily.
   - Reposition patient
 OOB to chair daily, position on side when
   sleeping given abdominal pannus
   - Continue nebs, and taper steroids today given COPD is ?diagnosis and
   patient w/o wheezing on exam for 48 hours.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The possible causes include tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, abdominal distention, and potential lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. A CT scan was performed, which showed multiple bony metastases but no obvious signs of lymphangitic spread. Induced sputum for cytology was unsuccessful.

The patient's respiratory status has improved somewhat with the use of BiPAP. She will continue to use BiPAP overnight and an NC/face tent during the day. The most recent ABG results show a pH within the normal range, suggesting that this is not an acute rise in CO2. The patient did not go on BiPAP until 5 am today for unclear reasons, and it will be written to keep her on BiPAP from at least 10 pm until 7 am daily.

Other interventions include repositioning the patient, keeping her net out 500-1L daily, providing aggressive bowel regimen to limit abdominal distention, pain control with morphine, and tapering steroids due to the questionable diagnosis of COPD. The patient has agreed to start chemotherapy today to see if it can help improve her respiratory status, given the clinical question of lymphangitic spread of cancer.

","Summary of the progress note:
- The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer.
- She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress.
- The respiratory distress may be caused by tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, splinting from pain, or lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lung.
- A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed but did not show any pulmonary embolism (PE) or obvious lymphangitic spread.
- The patient's mental status improved with BiPAP, so it will be continued at night and during naps.
- She will also use a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device during the day.
- The patient will be positioned on her side while sleeping due to abdominal pannus.
- Nebulizers and steroid tapering will be continued.
- An aggressive bowel regimen will be implemented to limit abdominal distention.
- Pain control with morphine will be maintained, which will also help with respirations.
- Chemotherapy has been started for possible lymphangitic spread of cancer.
- Preliminary pathology results indicate metastatic breast cancer to the liver and bone.
- The patient has elevated CEA, CA 27.29, but normal CA 15-9 levels.
- A liver biopsy is pending to confirm hormone responsiveness of the tumor."

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress due to tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea, abdominal distention, and possible lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs. The patient is currently on BiPAP support overnight and NC/face tent during the day. She has multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, schizophrenia disorder, and pain. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia put her at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and optimization of BiPAP support are crucial.
2. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient's leukocytosis suggests an ongoing infection. Close monitoring of vital signs, cultures, and clinical symptoms is necessary to identify and treat any infection promptly.
3. Metastatic spread of cancer: The patient has metastatic breast cancer with involvement of the liver and bone. Further evaluation is needed to determine the extent of lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lungs.
4. Chemotherapy complications: The patient has agreed to receive palliative chemotherapy to contain tumor growth. Chemotherapy can have side effects such as myelosuppression, increased risk of infection, and worsening respiratory status.

","Summary:
The patient is a 69-year-old female with a new diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer. She presents with multifactorial hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The possible causes include tracheobronchial malacia, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), abdominal distention, and splinting from pain. There is also a possibility of lymphangitic spread of cancer to the lung. The patient's mental status has improved with BiPAP, and she will continue to use it at night and during naps. NC/face tent will be used during the day.

Plan:
1. Reposition the patient out of bed (OOB) to a chair daily and position on side when sleeping due to abdominal pannus.
2. Continue nebs and taper steroids today given COPD is uncertain and the patient is without wheezing for 48 hours.
3. Aggressive bowel regimen to help limit abdominal distention.
4. Pain control with morphine, which will also help with respirations.
5. Chemotherapy started on [**6-17**] for possible lymphangitic spread of cancer.
6. Breast mass: Preliminary pathology showing metastatic breast cancer to the liver and bone. Awaiting final results of liver biopsy to confirm hormone responsiveness of tumor.
7. Meeting on [**6-16**] with patient, patient's HCP, and patient's outpatient psychiatrist to discuss options for chemotherapy"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath (SOB). She has a history of breast cancer, schizophrenia, and is currently undergoing chemotherapy, which includes steroid therapy. The patient is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with respiratory failure. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/56 mmHg to 96/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is on respiratory support with an aerosol-cool nasal cannula and is receiving dexamethasone as part of her chemotherapy treatment.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to her underlying conditions such as breast cancer and obesity-hypoventilation syndrome.
2. Infection: The patient has an increased white blood cell count, which could indicate an ongoing infection, potentially a urinary tract infection (UTI) given her recent urinary catheterization.
3. Thromboembolic Events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) due to prolonged immobility and use of central venous lines.
4. Medication Side Effects: Steroid therapy can lead to various side effects, including immunosuppression, hyperglycemia,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old obese woman admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure and a history of breast cancer. She is currently receiving dexamethasone as part of her chemotherapy. Her breathing has improved this morning, but she is still on respiratory support. She has a history of schizophrenia, increased white blood cell count, and a possible urinary tract infection. She is being treated with steroid therapy and is on a regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. She has multiple lines inserted for various purposes, including prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR) / do not intubate (DNI).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already in the ICU with respiratory failure, indicating a severe impairment in her ability to breathe effectively. This condition requires close monitoring and management to prevent further deterioration.
2. Breast Cancer: As the patient has a history of breast cancer, there is a possibility of metastasis or complications related to the disease, such as infection or sepsis.
3. Schizophrenia: The patient's schizophrenia may contribute to her overall health complications if her mental health is not appropriately managed during her ICU stay.
4. Increased White Blood Cell Count: The elevated white blood cell count suggests an infection or inflammation. This could potentially lead to a worsening of the patient's condition if the underlying cause is not identified"

   Much more alert and interactive this morning.  Her breathing seems much
   more comfortable.  She is getting dexamethasone as part of her
   chemotherapy so we will d/c as part of ""COPD"" care. Not clear how much
   obstructive lung disease she truly has - much of this is
   obesity-hypoventilation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old overweight/obese female with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. She has a medical history of breast cancer, schizophrenia, and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment with dexamethasone. The patient is in the ICU for respiratory failure and has been on steroid therapy. She is now more alert and interactive, with improved breathing. Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/56 mmHg to 96/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 94%, and temperature within normal range. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the respiratory system. The physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds and the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has been receiving various treatments, including prophylactic heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and nutritional support. She has a code status of DNR/DNI.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already in the ICU for respiratory failure, and her diminished breath sounds indicate potential complications in her respiratory system.
2. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may suggest an infection, possibly a urinary tract infection (UTI) or another source"
