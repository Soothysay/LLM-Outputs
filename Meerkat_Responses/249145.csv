","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU. They have no known drug allergies and have been receiving various infusions and medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate between 63-92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103/47-116/55 mmHg, respiratory rate between 14-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows a total input of 2,456 mL and output of 1,856 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 290 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support and has an ABG result of ///27/. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for pale conjunctiva. Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal electrolyte levels including low calcium, magnesium, and phosphate. The patient has a history of sleep disturbance but otherwise unchanged review of systems. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The elevated white blood cell count may indicate an ongoing infection. Close monitoring for signs of sepsis and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be considered.
2. Anemia: The decreased hemoglobin level suggests anemia. Further evaluation and management are necessary to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The abnormal electrolyte levels, particularly low"

   Assessment and Plan
   Assesment: This is a 79 year-old female with a history of HTN, embolic
   CVA on coumadin, hypothyroidism who presents with weakness,
   palpitations, orthostasis and unintentional weightloss found to have
   +guaiac stools  and HCT of 17 in ED. Patient with very low hematocrit,
   elevated INR of 2.5 on admission and blood in stool raises concern of
   active GI bleeding, possibly due to undiagnosed malignancy. Patient has
   not had a colonoscopy in the past.
   .
   Plan:
   # GI Bleed - Patient with HCt of 18 on presentation to the ED, down
   from 33 in [**11-7**]. NG lavage negative and melenotic stools supporting
   slow lower GI bleed. This may be chronic issue given recent weight loss
   and weakness, especially with concern of colon cancer. If patient
   becomes unstable, actively bleeding, GI will do EGD in the morning.
   - 2 large bore IVs in place
   - monitor serial HCT, Q6H x4
   - Transfuse for Hct > 21
   - IV PPI daily
   - reverse INR with vitamin K, hold coumadin/ASA as done in ED
   - f/u any GI recs
   - clear liquid diet, plan for bowel preep once INR <1.5
   .
   # Palpitations: Likely secondary to hypotension and orthostasis given
   poor PO intake. Also consider hyperthyroidism (TSH pending) in setting
   of weight loss. Arrhythmia unlikely given EKG but will monitor on
   telemetry overnight. Troponins negative x1 so less likely to be
   ischemic in nature.
   - telemetry
   - IVF as above
   .
   # Hypotension: Given patients decreased appetite for several days and
   guaiac + stool would consider hypovolemia/blood [**Last Name (un) 234**] as most likely
   etiology. Resolved with IVF in ED.
   - IV D5 1/2NS, bolus prn for SBP<90
   - transfuse hct<21 as above
   - monitor on telemetry
   - bedrest/fall precautions given orthostasis
   - hold home anti-hypertensives
   .
   # CVA: Embolic CVA in [**2186**], on coumadin. INR 2.5 on admission which is
   within goal range, however in setting of GI bleed will hold off for now
   until post-EGD.
   - hold coumadin given presumed active bleed, hold aspirin
   - telemetry
   .
   # Hypertension: patient on atenolol and hctz as outpatient, will hold
   in setting of hypotension.
   - hold atenolol, HCTZ,resume once hypotension resolves
   - monitor on telemetry
   .
   # Hyperlipidemia:
   - continue home statin
   .
   # Hypothyroidism: Patient has been on levothyroxine for some time. TSH
   pending. Will continue outpatient dose of levothyroxine provided TSH
   levels are normal.
   -continue levothyroxine
   .
   # FEN: on clears for now, IV D5 1/2NS@ 10ml/hr + bolus prn as above;
   monitor electrolytes and replete prn
   .
   # Access: 18G PIVx2
   .
   # PPx:  IV PPI
   .
   # Code: DNR/DNI, confirmed

   not had a colonoscopy in the past.
   .
   Plan:
   # GI Bleed
 Patient received 2U PRBC yesterday with little response in
   hct (19 this am). Concern for chronic bleed, will touch base with GI as
   EGD may need to be done sooner rather than later. She is
   - contact GI regarding [**Name (NI) 1726**] this morning
   - monitor serial HCT, Q6H x4
   - Transfuse for Hct > 21
   - IV PPI
   - reverse INR with vitamin K, hold coumadin/ASA as done in ED
   - clear liquid diet, plan for bowel prep once INR <1.5
   .
   # Palpitations: Patient denies any palpitations overnight. Likely
   secondary to hypotension and orthostasis given poor PO intake. Unlikely
   to be hyperthyroid given elevated TSH. Troponins negative x1 so less
   likely to be ischemic in nature.
   - telemetry
   - IVF as above

","Summary:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, embolic CVA on coumadin, and hypothyroidism. She presents with weakness, palpitations, orthostasis, and unintentional weight loss. In the emergency department, she was found to have guaiac positive stools and a hematocrit of 17, indicating active gastrointestinal bleeding. Her initial hematocrit was very low, and she had an elevated INR of 2.5. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) with little response in hematocrit. There is concern for chronic bleeding, possibly due to an undiagnosed malignancy. She has not had a colonoscopy in the past.

Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient will be monitored for serial hematocrit every 6 hours. She will be transfused for a hematocrit level >21. IV pantoprazole (PPI) will be administered, and her INR will be reversed with vitamin K. Coumadin and aspirin will be held. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) may be done soon to identify the source of bleeding.
2. Palpitations: The patient denies palpitations overnight. Palpitations are likely secondary to hypotension and orthostasis due to poor oral intake. They are unlikely to be hyperthyroid given the elevated TSH level. Telemetry will"

   palpitations, orthostasis and unintentional weightloss found to have
   +guaiac stools  and HCT of 17 in ED. Patient with very low hematocrit,

   # GI Bleed
 Patient received 2U PRBC yesterday with little response in
   hct (19 this am). This may be due to the fact that she received fluids
   as well as blood products. She is currently mildly hypotensive, but no
   BRBPR. Per GI recommendations this morning would like to get hct to
   mid-20s and INR<1.5, start bowel prep for endo-colonoscopy tomorrow

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a medical history of hypertension, embolic CVA on coumadin, and hypothyroidism. She presents with weakness, palpitations, orthostasis, unintentional weight loss, and guaiac-positive stools. The patient was found to have a hematocrit of 17 in the emergency department. Her initial assessment indicated a very low hematocrit, elevated INR of 2.5, and blood in the stool, raising concerns of active gastrointestinal bleeding, possibly due to an undiagnosed malignancy. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells yesterday with little response in hematocrit. She is currently mildly hypotensive but without blood pressure drop. The plan includes getting the hematocrit to mid-20s and INR <1.5, starting bowel prep for endo-colonoscopy tomorrow morning.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. GI Bleeding: The patient has evidence of ongoing GI bleeding, as indicated by the presence of blood in the stool and a low hematocrit. This can lead to significant blood loss, hypotension, and potentially shock if not managed appropriately.

2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is currently mildly low, which may be due to fluid shifts from the recent blood transfusion and fluid administration. If not closely monitored and managed, hypotension can lead to inadequate organ perfusion and potential organ damage"

   palpitations, orthostasis and unintentional weightloss found to have
   +guaiac stools  and HCT of 17 in ED. Patient with very low hematocrit,
   elevated INR of 2.5 on admission and blood in stool raises concern of
   active GI bleeding, possibly due to undiagnosed malignancy. Patient has
   not had a colonoscopy in the past.  Now s/p upper endoscopy revealing
   large stomach mass concerning for malignancy with pathology pending.
   Plan:
   # GI Bleed
 Patient received total of 4 U pRBCs. Crit this morning is
   28, which is stable from yesterday. Currently afebrile, normotensive
   with normal heart rate.  No signs of brisk bleed - no melena or
   hematemesis. Patient had CT scan yesterday of abdomen to furthur
   work-up malignancy. Initially plan for colonscopy for furthur work-up
   but as per GI currently going to hold off.
   - biopsy results pending
   - consider surgical consult pending biopsy results
   - changed PPi to 40 [**Hospital1 7**]
   - f/u read of CT abdomen
   - Transfuse for Hct > 21
   - IV PPI
   - hold coumadin/ASA for now
   - clear liquid diet
   .
   # Palpitations: Patient currently without palpitations, issue appears
   to have resolved. Likely initially secondary to hypotension and
   orthostasis given poor PO intake. Unlikely to be hyperthyroid given
   elevated TSH. Troponins negative x2 so less likely to be ischemic in
   nature.
   - cont telemetry monitoring while in the ICU
   # Hypotension: Patient currently normotensive (resolved)
   - maintence fluids if NPO or if taking poor PO intake
   - transfuse hct<21 as above
   - bedrest/fall precautions given orthostasis
   - hold home anti-hypertensives
   .
   # CVA: Embolic CVA in [**2186**], on coumadin. INR 2.5 on admission which is
   within goal range, however in setting of GI bleed will hold off for now

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA) on coumadin, and hypothyroidism. She presents with weakness, palpitations, orthostasis, unintentional weight loss, and positive guaiac stools. In the emergency department, she was found to have a hematocrit level of 17. A large gastric mass was discovered during an upper endoscopy, which is concerning for malignancy. The patient has not had a colonoscopy in the past. She received a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable with a hematocrit level of 28. She is afebrile, normotensive, and has a normal heart rate. There are no signs of brisk bleeding. A CT scan of the abdomen was performed to further work up the malignancy. Initially, a plan for colonoscopy was considered, but it has been put on hold. Biopsy results are pending, and a surgical consult will be considered pending the biopsy results. The patient's palpitations have resolved, and her hypotension appears to have resolved as well. Her CVA medication (aspirin and coumadin) will be held due to the active gastrointestinal bleed. Her hypertension medication will also be held in the setting of hypotension. She will continue her home statin for hyperlipidemia and her"

   Assessment and Plan
   79 yo female admit with GI bleed--with subacute evolution to the point
   of having significant orthostatic hypotension associated with it.  Upon
   further evaluation she has had concern raised for gastric mass and
   biopsies have been taken.  CT scan does support the concern for
   malignancy and current planning is aound considering next steps in
   evaluation and treatment of the mass identified.
   1)GI Bleed
reasonable stability of HCT
   -Continue with PPI
   -Return to PO diet
   -Goal HCT stable at 24 and will check [**Hospital1 7**]
   -Colonsocpy deferred
   2)Gastic Mass-
   -Biopsies pending
   -Consider further imaging based upon findings of biopsy
   -Will have to consider consultation with GI and possibly oncology to
   consider further evaluation and treatment planning.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 79-year-old female admitted with a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and significant orthostatic hypotension. The patient has undergone an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed a large gastric mass. A CT scan also showed a gastric mass with potential liver and pancreatic involvement. Biopsies have been taken for further evaluation. The patient's current plan involves considering next steps in the evaluation and treatment of the identified mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. GI Bleed:
- The patient may experience further bleeding from the gastric ulcer or mass.
- There is a risk of re-bleeding or persistent bleeding, which could lead to hypotension and shock.
- The patient's stability and response to treatment will determine the progression of the condition.

2. Gastric Mass:
- The presence of a gastric mass raises concerns about malignancy.
- Further imaging studies, such as an endoscopic ultrasound or PET scan, may be necessary to assess the extent of the mass and its potential spread to other organs.
- Consultation with gastroenterology and oncology specialists will be required for further evaluation and treatment planning.
- Complications may arise based on the type and stage of the mass, such as metastasis, obstruction, or perforation.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided progress note. Additional information may be required for a more comprehensive assessment."
