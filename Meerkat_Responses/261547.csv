   This image covers the lung bases and includes now also the left base
   which was not completely seen on the previous study obtained three
   hours earlier. The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid
   collection.
   The lower border of the previously described left-sided pulmonary
   parenchymal infiltrate is seen and matches what has been described on
   the preceding study.
   When comparison is made with the next preceding study of [**2170-1-21**], the lungs where clear from any focal consolidation. Thus, the
   present study, including this additional image over the lung base
   towards the diagnosis of multifocal parenchymal infiltrates and absence
   of pleural effusion in the pleural sinus makes significant CHF
   unlikely.

   This image covers the lung bases and includes now also the left base
   which was not completely seen on the previous study obtained three
   hours earlier. The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid
   collection.
   The lower border of the previously described left-sided pulmonary
   parenchymal infiltrate is seen and matches what has been described on
   the preceding study.
   When comparison is made with the next preceding study of [**2170-1-21**], the lungs where clear from any focal consolidation. Thus, the
   present study, including this additional image over the lung base
   towards the diagnosis of multifocal parenchymal infiltrates and absence
   of pleural effusion in the pleural sinus makes significant CHF
   unlikely.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 

The patient's vital signs indicate an elevated temperature of 101.4°F (38.6°C) and a heart rate of 81 bpm. Blood pressure is within normal limits, with readings ranging from 120/51 to 139/70 mmHg. The respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation is 90%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 9,704 mL and a total output of 4,255 mL since midnight. The patient has received a total of 6,204 mL of IV fluids. Blood products have been transfused, with a total output of 1,245 mL. Urine output is at 2,655 mL.

The patient is receiving respiratory support through a BiPAP mask, with CPAP/PSV mode ventilation. The tidal volume (Vt) is 649 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is set at 7 cmH2O, and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) is 80%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show pH 7.36, pCO2 74, pO2 61, HCO3 42, and base excess 9.

The patient's laboratory results indicate leukocytosis with a white blood cell count (WBC) of 26.6 K/uL, elevated creatinine (Cr) of 0.8 mg/dL, elevated lactate level of 8 mg/dL, and elevated troponin-T level of 0.66 ng/mL. Other lab values, including hemoglobin (Hct), platelet count (Plt), glucose, and electrolytes, are provided in the note.

Imaging studies show a left-sided pulmonary parenchymal infiltrate, but there is no evidence of pleural effusion. This finding suggests the absence of significant congestive heart failure (CHF).

The patient's condition is complicated by electrolyte and fluid disorders, sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia (bacterial, community-acquired), and acute exacerbation of COPD. The patient is being managed in the ICU with appropriate supportive care, including nutrition, glycemic control, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   This image covers the lung bases and includes now also the left base
   which was not completely seen on the previous study obtained three
   hours earlier. The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid
   collection.
   The lower border of the previously described left-sided pulmonary
   parenchymal infiltrate is seen and matches what has been described on
   the preceding study.
   When comparison is made with the next preceding study of [**2170-1-21**], the lungs where clear from any focal consolidation. Thus, the
   present study, including this additional image over the lung base
   towards the diagnosis of multifocal parenchymal infiltrates and absence
   of pleural effusion in the pleural sinus makes significant CHF
   unlikely.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), continuous home oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on bipap at night, coronary artery disease (CAD), and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presents with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, demand cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to severe multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's symptoms, including sinus symptoms, and the presence of mixed flora in multilobar pneumonia suggest this as a potential complication.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute exacerbation of COPD and severe pneumonia may lead to respiratory failure.
3. Cardiac Demand Ischemia: The patient's recent EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes indicate possible cardiac demand ischemia.
4. Hypercoagulable State: The patient's recent dietary changes and sepsis increase the risk of a hypercoagulable state.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels are likely due to infection/stress and will need to be managed with insulin.
6. Hypokalemia: The patient's low potassium levels may be due to diuretic use, decreased respiratory effort, and IV fluids.
7. Anemia of Chronic Disease (AOCD): The patient's low hem"

   This image covers the lung bases and includes now also the left base
   which was not completely seen on the previous study obtained three
   hours earlier. The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any fluid
   collection.
   The lower border of the previously described left-sided pulmonary
   parenchymal infiltrate is seen and matches what has been described on
   the preceding study.
   When comparison is made with the next preceding study of [**2170-1-21**], the lungs where clear from any focal consolidation. Thus, the
   present study, including this additional image over the lung base
   towards the diagnosis of multifocal parenchymal infiltrates and absence
   of pleural effusion in the pleural sinus makes significant CHF
   unlikely.

   Agree with plan to manage severe multifocal CAP c/b septic shock with
   broad abx coverage - will use zosyn and azithro for now. Not at high
   risk for MRSA, will hold off on vanco and will check nasal MRSA swab.
   Will check sputum GS/cx and legionella Ag. For mixed hypoxic /
   hypercarbic respiratory failure, will place art line and continue NPPV
   with critical care ventilator. For component of COPD flare, will
   continue nebs and IV steroids. For hypotension, continue IVF, check CVP
   and CvO2; I suspect he will still need a few liters, UOP is already
   picking up, will wean pressors as able, goal UOP >30cc/h. For
   coagulopathy, will check LFTs and replete vitamin K. He is critically
   hypokalemic in the setting of new alkalosis and baseline lasix;
   continue IV repletion and close monitoring. For abnormal EKG and modest
   troponin elevations in the setting of profound stress, will continue
   aspirin and plavix and cycle; may need to consider echo if hypotension
   persists. Remainder of plan as outlined in resident admission note.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, CAD, and severe OSA. He presented to the hospital with symptoms of increased shortness of breath, productive cough, and vomiting. The patient was found to be hypotensive and hypoxemic upon arrival. A chest X-ray showed signs of pneumonia, and laboratory results indicated a high white blood cell count with 4% bands. The patient was treated with CTX, vancomycin, and zosyn in the emergency department and was transferred to the MICU on levo at 0.11.

Upon examination, the patient had a temperature of 101.3°F, blood pressure of 106/50 mmHg, heart rate of 76 bpm, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91% on non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). The physical examination revealed coarse breath sounds at the left base, mild respiratory distress on NPPV, flat jugular venous distention (JVD), and prolonged expiration with rhonchi bilaterally. The patient's blood lab results showed elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin concentration, low potassium levels, normal creatinine levels, elevated lactate levels, prolonged INR, and slightly elevated troponin levels.

The assessment and plan include managing severe multifocal community-acquired pneumonia complicated by septic shock, respiratory failure, COPD exacerbation,"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), on continuous home oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on biPAP at night, coronary artery disease (CAD), and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presents with severe pneumonia (PNA), respiratory failure, demand cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient's current medications include aspirin (ASA), clopidogrel (Plavix), a beta-blocker (BB), simvastatin (Zocor), lisinopril, lasix, metolazone, montelukast, citalopram (lexapro), and olopatadine (Patanol). He also takes Tylenol PM for insomnia and Benadryl IV as needed for biPAP usage.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C (99.1°F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 128/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on biPAP. His current weight is 130 kg.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 25.1 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) of 10.5 g/dL, blood glucose (Glucose) of 180 mg/dL, sodium (Na+) of 141 mEq/L, potassium (K+) of 3.5 mEq/L, chloride (Cl-) of 98 mEq/L, carbon dioxide (CO2) of 32.3%, creatinine (Cr) of 0.6 mg/dL, and troponin T of 0.34 mcg/L. Other lab values include elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as low albumin, calcium (Ca++), and magnesium (Mg++).

The patient has a history of seasonal allergies, chronic diastolic heart failure, CAD, depression, dry eyes, insomnia, and anemia. He is currently being treated for sepsis due to severe multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), respiratory failure, and demand cardiac ischemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's COPD exacerbation and severe pneumonia put him at risk for further respiratory compromise.
2. Cardiac ischemia: The patient's EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes suggest ongoing cardiac ischemia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Electrolyte imbalances: The patient has hypokalemia and other electrolyte abnormalities that need to be corrected.
4. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC and CRP indicate an ongoing infectious process, and he requires aggressive management of his sepsis.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels indicate hyperglycemia, which needs to be managed with insulin.
6. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels and suspected anemia of chronic disease (A"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old man with hypoxemic respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia. He remains tenuous and unable to come off NIPPV for any significant length of time. The physician has discussed the situation with the patient, who is alert and conversant. Intubation is being held off for now, but a low threshold to intubate will be maintained. A Lasix challenge will be attempted to get some volume off.

The patient has a history of allergies to iodine and has received antibiotics including azithromycin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). He is currently on various medications such as famotidine (Pepcid), heparin sodium (prophylaxis), furosemide (Lasix), and others.

His vital signs include a temperature of 37.3°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/77 mmHg to 88/46 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 92%, and sinus tachycardia as his heart rhythm. His weight is 130 kg, and his height is 70 inches. His central venous pressure (CVP) is 14 mmHg, and fluid balance shows an intake of 3,054 mL, output of 2,845 mL, and a positive balance of 209 mL since midnight.

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presented with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. He was admitted to the ICU and placed on mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, cardiac ischemia, and other medical issues. He is currently receiving multiple antibiotics, diuretics, and other medications for his various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to severe multilobar CAP: The patient is already on a combination of antibiotics for atypical bacteria, staphylococcus, pseudomonas, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. However, the therapeutic level of Vancomycin is slightly below the desired range, so the pharmacy should be consulted about adjusting the dosage.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to a combination of COPD and pneumonia. He has been switched from BiPAP to intubation and mechanical ventilation. ABGs show a quick drop in CO2 leading to alkalosis. The tidal volume should be decreased to achieve a pH goal around 7.45.

3. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG and elevated CK-MB fraction. He should continue to"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with hypoxic respiratory failure and multilobar pneumonia. He is currently intubated and receiving supplemental oxygen through an endotracheal tube. The patient's FiO2 has been reduced to 50%. The patient's condition is critical, and he is sedated and unable to provide a history.

The patient was previously on non-invasive ventilation but was switched to invasive ventilation due to respiratory failure. An arterial line has been placed, and the patient is receiving multiple antibiotics including Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin, Meropenem, and Vancomycin.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), a heart rate of 72 bpm with a range of 64-103 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 65-88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute with a range of 16-28 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 91%. The patient's central venous pressure (CVP) is 15 mmHg, and his fluid balance shows an intake of 2,685 mL, output of 3,385 mL, and a negative balance of 700 mL.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 25.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.0 g/dL, platelet count of 243 K/uL, blood glucose of 172 mg/dL, and creatinine of 0.6 mg/dL. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's respiratory support consists of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, with a set tidal volume (Vt) of 600 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 28 cmH2O, plateau pressure (Pplateau) of 25 cmH2O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 15 cmH2O, and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.48, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / FiO2 ratio of 124, and a ventilation rate (Ve) of 9 L/min.

The patient's physical examination reveals that he is intubated and sedated, with normal heart sounds, symmetric chest expansion, rhonchorous breath sounds, and soft non-tender abdomen. Neurological examination is not fully assessed.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, for which he is being weaned off mechanical ventilation, and multilobar pneumonia, for which he is receiving multiple antibiotics. The patient has a full code status and is critically ill."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), continuous home oxygen, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on bipap at night, coronary artery disease (CAD), and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presents with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, demand cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Sepsis due to severe multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient is being treated with antibiotics for atypical organisms, staphylococcus, and pseudomonas. Continuous monitoring of the patient's vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of COPD and pneumonia. Weaning from mechanical ventilation and providing adequate oxygenation support will be crucial.
3) Cardiac demand ischemia: The patient has evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG and elevated cardiac enzymes. Medications such as aspirin and Plavix will be continued, and beta-blockers may be held in the setting of recent pressor requirements.
4) Hypercoagulable state: The patient's recent diet and sepsis may contribute to a hypercoagulable state. Monitoring of INR and adding liver function tests"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, CAD, and right diaphragmatic paralysis. The patient presents with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities.

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis due to severe multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The plan is to change antibiotics to high-dose levofloxacin and discontinue other antibiotics for CAP. The patient will be volume resuscitated as needed, considering diastolic heart failure. Tylenol will be given for fever.

The patient is also experiencing respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation and pneumonia. The plan is to perform a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) for one hour. If successful, the patient will be extubated to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). If not, the patient will continue on mechanical ventilation overnight and attempt another SBT in the morning.

Secretions will be irrigated and suctioned to clear the airway. Inhaled bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium) will be given every four hours, as well as prednisone 40 mg orally once a day. The dosage of prednisone will be decreased to 20 mg orally once a day tomorrow.

The patient has chronic diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) and coronary artery disease (CAD). The plan is to continue aspir"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, CAD, and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presents with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and other comorbidities. The patient's current medications include continuous home oxygen, bipap at night, and multiple medications for various conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1) Sepsis due to Severe multilobar CAP: The patient has been prescribed levofloxacin for 10 days.
2) Respiratory Failure: The patient's COPD and pneumonia are causing respiratory failure. A chest X-ray has been ordered, and the patient will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) to determine if he can be extubated to NIPPV and BiPAP at night. If the SBT is successful, the patient will be extubated; otherwise, he will continue on mechanical ventilation.
3) Chronic diastolic CHF and CAD: The patient's congestive heart failure and CAD require continued treatment with ASA and Plavix. Beta-blockers and other medications will be held due to hypotension on pressors.
4) Cardiac Demand Ischemia: The patient has evidence of cardiac ischemia on EKG and enzyme levels. He will continue taking ASA and Plavix, and beta-blockers will be restarted if hypertension occurs.
5) Hyperglycemia: The patient's elevated blood glucose levels are"

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of COPD, OSA, CAD, and right diaphragmatic paralysis. He presents with severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, and electrolyte abnormalities. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with acute exacerbation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis due to severe multilobar community-acquired pneumonia (CAP): The patient's current condition indicates sepsis, and the previous antibiotics have not been effective. Levofloxacin has been continued, but additional measures may be needed to treat the infection.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is a result of COPD and pneumonia. A chest X-ray has been ordered, and the decision to extubate the patient to non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or continue mechanical ventilation will depend on the results of the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
3. Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure and Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's chronic diastolic heart failure and CAD require ongoing management with ASA and Plavix. Holding beta-blockers and lisinopril is necessary due to hypotension on pressors.
4. Cardiac Demand Ischemia: The patient's EKG and enzyme levels suggest cardiac demand ischemia. ASA and Plavix should"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 53-year-old male with respiratory failure from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) on a background of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 129/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on FiO2 40%. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated with levofloxacin. His COPD is being managed with bronchodilators, and he is also receiving other medications for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)/demand ischemia, hyperglycemia, and possible diabetes. 

The patient's recent laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hematocrit of 31.3%, platelet count of 248 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL, total carbon dioxide level of 44 mEq/L, glucose level of 138 mg/dL, and an arterial blood gas (ABG) with pH 7.40, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) 56 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) 163 mmHg, and bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 37 mEq/L. 

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/pressure support ventilation (PSV) mode, tidal volume (Vt) of 480 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%, respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) of 22, peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 13 cmH2O, and oxygenation parameters indicating good oxygenation. 

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds, trace edema in both lower extremities, and inability to stand due to muscle weakness. 

Potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE)."

","Summary:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), right diaphragmatic paralysis, and severe pneumonia. He presents with respiratory failure, cardiac ischemia, electrolyte abnormalities, sepsis, and pneumonia. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation but has been extubated and is doing well on BiPAP. He has been prescribed multiple medications including antibiotics, steroids, diuretics, and insulin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's history of COPD and severe pneumonia puts him at risk for further respiratory failure. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and oxygenation is crucial.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The patient has a history of CAD and recent cardiac ischemia. It is important to continue monitoring his cardiac status and continue with prescribed medications such as ASA and Plavix.
3. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, need to be addressed and managed appropriately.
4. Sepsis: The patient is currently being treated for sepsis secondary to severe multilobar CAP. Continuous monitoring of his vital signs and infection parameters is necessary.
5. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, and there is a risk of worsening or development of new infections. Monitoring of respiratory symptoms and appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential.
6. Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient has chronic di"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 53-year-old male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), coronary artery disease (CAD), right diaphragmatic paralysis, and severe pneumonia (PNA). He presented with respiratory failure and cardiac ischemia. The patient was initially on invasive ventilation but was successfully extubated and transitioned to non-invasive ventilation using BiPAP. His current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C, heart rate of 63 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 98/52 mmHg to 276/246 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

The patient has shown improvements in his condition, including good gas exchange with a pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 51 mmHg, and PaO2 of 58 mmHg. He has also diuresed and achieved negative fluid balance over the past 20 hours. However, he experienced episodes of vomiting and has been on NPO status with a protected airway. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 12.6 K/uL and elevated troponin-T levels of 190. Other lab results are within normal limits. The patient's imaging studies show no significant changes. 

Medical complications that can arise include pneumonia, electrolyte and fluid disorders, sepsis without organ dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary"
