   Assessment and Plan
   1) SIRS:  Suspect sepsis, but no source identified via history.  She
   met 3 of 4 SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension.
   Consider intraabdominal process given frequent diarrhea overnight vs.
   aspiration pneumonia given that she was found in bed with emesis vs.
   meningitis given altered mental status.
   - Empiric antibiotic coverage for GI vs. aspiration process with
   levo/flagyl
   - Discontinue Vancomycin
   - Fluid resuscitation to goal MAP > 65
   - f/u CT abdomen final report
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - taper stress dose steroids to  Hydrocort 100 q12 hours in the setting
   of acute illness and chronic steroid dependence
   2) Altered mental status:  Consider primary intracranial process vs.
   meningitis/encephalatis vs. post-ictal state given known seizure
   disorder vs. excerbation of old left MCA infarct in the setting of
   acute infection.  CT head performed in ED revealed only presence of old
   infarct.  Mental status now improved and patient appears at baseline
   with chronic word-finding aphasia.
   - LP today to r/o meningitis
   3) ARF:  Baseline creatinine per [**Hospital1 12**] records = 0.88.  Estimated GFR 43
   at presentation with Cr 1.2. Creatinine now back to baseline following
   fluid resuscitation.
   - redoes meds
   - Continue Mucomyst as renal protection in the setting of contrast
   administration
   - follow urine output
   4) Hypopituairism, s/p resection of pituitary adenoma:
   - Stress dose steroids as above, with plan to taper back to home dose
   - Continue Levoxyl for thyroid replacement
   - Continue estradiol replacement w/ Divigel
   5) Seizure disorder:  secondary to prior left MCA stroke.
   - Continue Lamotrigine
   6) FEN:
   - Clear liquid diet; will advance as tolerated.
   - Replete K, Mg, Phos and recheck chem-10 in PM.
   7) PPx:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - SSI while on stress-dose steroids
   8) Code status:  Full code, confirmed with brother Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

","Summary:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a history of hypopituitarism, secondary to pituitary adenoma resection, and a seizure disorder secondary to a left middle cerebral artery stroke. She was admitted to the ICU due to altered mental status and signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which may indicate sepsis. The patient has been experiencing diarrhea, constipation, agitation, and has had rectal impaction. She is currently weaned off levophed, receiving stress dose steroids, and has received a total of 7 liters of normal saline. The CT abdomen revealed rectal impaction, and she spontaneously passed a large volume, hard bowel movement. The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, hypotension, and normal respiratory rate. Her blood cultures and other lab results are pending.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient meets three out of four SIRS criteria, indicating a possible infection. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated, and further evaluation is needed to identify the source of infection.
2. Meningitis/Encephalitis: The patient's altered mental status raises concerns about meningitis or encephalitis. A CT head was performed, revealing an old infarct but no evidence of acute intracranial process. Ceftriaxone has been administered as empiric coverage for bacterial meningitis.
3. Acute Renal Failure (ARF"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient has been in the ICU for several days and has multiple medical conditions, including anxiety, sepsis without organ dysfunction, and a possible stercoral ulcer from fecal impaction. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 88/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood glucose levels.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's current diagnosis of sepsis without organ dysfunction indicates an ongoing infection in the body. This condition can lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure if not promptly treated.
2. Stercoral Ulcer: The patient's history of diarrhea and subsequent development of a stercoral ulcer suggests a potential complication of fecal impaction causing perforation of the bowel wall. This condition may require surgical intervention.
3. Altered Mental Status (AMS): The patient's altered mental status could be due to several factors, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalances, or a recurrence of a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Close monitoring and further investigations are necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
4. Acute Kidney Injury"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a chief complaint of altered mental status. The patient was previously diagnosed with sepsis without organ dysfunction, anxiety, altered mental status (not delirium), acute kidney injury (likely pre-renal vs. acute tubular necrosis), pancreatitis, and seizure disorder. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus.

The patient's condition has improved overnight, with mental status improvement and weaning off Levophed. The patient is now on hydrocortisone 100 mcg q8h and has passed a large amount of stool. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6 C (99.6 F), heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 88/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula.

Fluid balance shows an intake of 11,024 mL and output of 3,525 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 7,499 mL. The patient's laboratory results indicate a WBC count of 6.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 11.3 g/dL, platelet count of 210 K/uL, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose of 116 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including potassium"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a history of pit tumor and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) who presented with fever. In the emergency department, she had a chest X-ray and urinalysis which were normal, and an attempt to obtain a lumbar puncture (LP) was unsuccessful. She received broad-spectrum antibiotics and hydrocortisone. Upon arrival in the ICU, she also had abdominal pain and tenderness.

The patient's condition has been fluctuating, with improvements and deteriorations noted. Her vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. She is currently receiving IV fluids and has been weaned off levophed. Her mental status has improved overnight.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 11.3 g/dL, slightly low platelet count of 210 K/uL, normal hemoglobin level of 107 mg/dL, slightly low sodium level of 0.7 mg/dL, normal potassium level of 24 mEq/L, elevated blood glucose level of 116 mg/dL, and elevated creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

The patient's physical examination revealed expressive aphasia, right"

   Assessment and Plan
   1) SIRS:  Suspect sepsis, but no source identified via history.  She
   met 3 of 4 SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension.
   Consider intraabdominal process given frequent diarrhea overnight vs.
   aspiration pneumonia given that she was found in bed with emesis vs.
   meningitis given altered mental status.
   - Empiric antibiotic coverage for GI vs. aspiration process with
   levo/flagyl
   - Discontinue Vancomycin
   - Fluid resuscitation to goal MAP > 65
   - f/u CT abdomen final report
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - taper stress dose steroids to  Hydrocort 100 q12 hours in the setting
   of acute illness and chronic steroid dependence
   2) Altered mental status:  Consider primary intracranial process vs.
   meningitis/encephalatis vs. post-ictal state given known seizure
   disorder vs. excerbation of old left MCA infarct in the setting of
   acute infection.  CT head performed in ED revealed only presence of old
   infarct.  Mental status now improved and patient appears at baseline
   with chronic word-finding aphasia.
   - LP today to r/o meningitis
   3) ARF:  Baseline creatinine per [**Hospital1 12**] records = 0.88.  Estimated GFR 43
   at presentation with Cr 1.2. Creatinine now back to baseline following
   fluid resuscitation.
   - redoes meds
   - Continue Mucomyst as renal protection in the setting of contrast
   administration
   - follow urine output
   4) Hypopituairism, s/p resection of pituitary adenoma:
   - Stress dose steroids as above, with plan to taper back to home dose
   - Continue Levoxyl for thyroid replacement
   - Continue estradiol replacement w/ Divigel
   5) Seizure disorder:  secondary to prior left MCA stroke.
   - Continue Lamotrigine
   6) FEN:
   - Clear liquid diet; will advance as tolerated.
   - Replete K, Mg, Phos and recheck chem-10 in PM.
   7) PPx:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - SSI while on stress-dose steroids
   8) Code status:  Full code, confirmed with brother Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   9) Communication:  Brother Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] (office),

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old female with multiple medical conditions, including hypopituitarism, altered mental status, seizure disorder, and acute kidney injury. She has been admitted to the ICU due to suspected sepsis and requires aggressive management. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. SIRS: The patient meets three out of four SIRS criteria, indicating a potential sepsis. It is important to identify the source of infection and provide appropriate antibiotic coverage.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is a concern, and further evaluation is needed to rule out meningitis or other intracranial processes. A lumbar puncture has been performed.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): The patient's baseline creatinine level is elevated, and her estimated GFR is 43. Close monitoring of urine output and adjustment of medications based on renal function are necessary.
4. Hypopituitarism: The patient requires stress dose steroids due to her resection of pituitary adenoma. Thyroid and estradiol replacement therapy should continue as well.
5. Seizure Disorder: The patient has a history of seizures secondary to a left MCA stroke. Lamotrigine therapy should be continued.
6. Feeding: The patient is on clear liquids and should be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated. Electrolyte repletion and repeat chemistry tests are required.

   Assessment and Plan
   1) SIRS:  Suspect sepsis, but no source identified via history.  She
   met 3 of 4 SIRS criteria with leukocytosis, fever, and hypotension.
   Consider intraabdominal process given diarrhea vs. aspiration pneumonia
   given that she was found in bed with emesis vs. meningitis given
   altered mental status.  LP is not suggestive of meningitis.  CT abdomen
   without explanation for symptoms.
   - Empiric antibiotic coverage for GI vs. aspiration process with
   levo/flagyl
   - Discontinued Vancomycin
   - f/u blood and urine cultures
   - taper stress dose steroids to  Hydrocort 100 q12 hours in the setting
   of acute illness and chronic steroid dependence
   2) Altered mental status:  Now resolved.  Consider primary intracranial
   process vs. post-ictal state given known seizure disorder vs.
   excerbation of old left MCA infarct in the setting of acute infection.
   CT head performed in ED revealed only presence of old infarct.  Mental
   status now improved and patient appears at baseline with chronic
   word-finding aphasia.
   - LP today to r/o meningitis
   3) ARF:  Baseline creatinine per [**Hospital1 12**] records = 0.88.  Estimated GFR 43
   at presentation with Cr 1.2. Creatinine now back to baseline following
   fluid resuscitation.
   - follow up UOP
   4) Hypopituairism, s/p resection of pituitary adenoma:   Increased
   UOP.  ? diabetes insipidus.  Consider urinelytes if serum sodium
   changes.
   - Stress dose steroids as above, with plan to taper back to home dose
   - Continue Levoxyl for thyroid replacement
   - Continue estradiol replacement w/ Divigel
   5) Seizure disorder:  secondary to prior left MCA stroke.
   - Continue Lamotrigine
   6) FEN:
   - Clear liquid diet; will advance as tolerated.
   - Replete K, Mg, Phos and recheck chem-10 in PM.
   7) PPx:
   - SC heparin as DVT prophylaxis
   - SSI while on stress-dose steroids
   8) Code status:  Full code, confirmed with brother Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   9) Communication:  Brother Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 5045**] (office),

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with multiple medical complications. She presented to the ICU with hypotension, increased urine output, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of pituitary adenoma resection, seizure disorder, chronic steroid dependence, and chronic word-finding aphasia. 

During her stay in the ICU, the patient's condition has been monitored closely. She received antibiotics for suspected sepsis, but no source of infection was identified. Her mental status improved, and a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed to rule out meningitis. The CT scan of her head showed an old infarct, and her creatinine levels returned to baseline after fluid resuscitation.

The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) with an estimated GFR of 43 at presentation and a baseline creatinine of 0.88. She has hypopituitarism due to the resection of her pituitary adenoma, which is causing increased urine output and the possibility of diabetes insipidus. The patient is receiving stress dose steroids, thyroid replacement, estradiol replacement, and continues on Lamotrigine for her seizure disorder.

She is on a clear liquid diet and is being monitored for electrolyte imbalances. Prophylactic measures include subcutaneous heparin for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcer prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and her"
