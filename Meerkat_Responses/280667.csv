   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   .
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx,pleural fluid cx
   - send stool cx when able
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HA
   - will need to swap out lines
   ..
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain
   - goal diuresis 1 L neg today with IV lasix
   - check PM lytes and replete as needed
   - f/u infectious w/u
   .
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor
   - Continue ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - continue metoprolol 12.5 TID PO
   - complete IV amiodarone load today and switch to PO
   .
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   .
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR yesterday with increased effusion so
   pigtail unclamped and has drained 1 L.
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   .
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - continue pigtail to water seal
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   .
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   .
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - continue metoprolol PO for rate control
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic
   .
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   .
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   .

   - Continue ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - given hypotension,  titirate off metoprolol 12.5 TID PO to [**Hospital1 **] and
   possibly stop tomorrow if amio works
   - complete IV amiodarone load today and switch to PO 400mg [**Hospital1 **]
   - wil not restart digoxin

   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   .
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.

   - send stool cx when able
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HA
   - will need to swap out lines

   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt.
   - goal diuresis 1 L neg today with IV lasix
   - check PM lytes and replete as needed
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - repeat ABAG/VBG
   .
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor
   - Continue ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - DC metoprolol 12.5 TID PO  for hypotension
   - complete IV amiodarone load today and switch to PO
   .
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   .
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR yesterday with increased effusion so
   pigtail unclamped and has drained 1 L.

   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped

","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous hospitalization for left lower lobe pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypoxia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and fever. The patient has been experiencing prolonged hospitalization complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, trap lung, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent Pneumonia: The patient's persistent hypoxia despite fluid removal and thick secretions is concerning for recurrent pneumonia. She has several possible sources including recurrent pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and pleural fluid.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has been hypoxic for numerous reasons during her extended hospital stay. Currently, I suspect a component of pulmonary edema in the setting of getting extra intravenous fluids and starting total parenteral nutrition (TF), as well as atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and possibly flash pulmonary edema. Chest X-ray at the time of transfer does not show evidence of worsening pulmonary edema.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient has been on DVT prophylaxis, PE remains on the differential, although lower suspicion at this time. Electrocardiogram (EKG) without signs of right heart strain.

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she is not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Spiked fever and has secretions.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.  She returns today after getting IV fluid on
   the floor and going into afib with RVR and desatting.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   -Will amiodarone load and start drip with goal of removing beta
   blockade.
   -Will transition to PO amiodarone
   -Continue dig if she does not completely respond to amiodarone
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Started on emperic Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   -Would not diuresis
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: suspect related to RVR and flash edema.
   If hypoxemia does not respond to rate control will consider PE in
   differential.
   - goal even today
   -Will repeat ABG and VBG
   -Getting TTE with Bubble
   -If negative and she does not return to her baseline with rate control
   will start IV heprin.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is more
   somulent than baseline but this is in the setting of narcotics.
   - check ABG to make sure she is not retaining
   - hold sedating meds
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   -Tube continues to drain >100cc per day.
   - continue pigtail to water seal
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to assess plan for pig tail.  Talc pleuradesis through the tube is
   one option will discuss with IP service
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - Will try to decrease metoprolol with goal to stop ifwell controlled
   on amiodarone.
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), and a history of lung problems. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and developed a large left effusion with a trapped lung after placement of a Pleurex catheter. She also had an open J-tube placed. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the Pleurex catheter. 

Upon her return to the ICU, she experienced IV fluid boluses the previous night for low urine output and received Lopressor 2.5 mg IV twice with improvement of heart rate to the 100s. She also received 20 IV Lasix with an 800 cc urine output. Additionally, she received 2 mg IV morphine.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 101.7°F (Tmax), heart rate in the 110s (HR), blood pressure ranging from 97/71 to 100/60 mmHg (BP), respiratory rate in the 30s (RR), and oxygen saturation at 98% on HiFlow mask. Her heart rhythm is still in atrial fibrillation (AF). The patient appears uncomfortable and cannot relate any further history.

The patient has several medical complications that can arise, including:

   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she is not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Spiked fever and has secretions.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   -Will amiodarone load and start drip with goal of removing beta
   blockade.
   -Will transition to PO amiodarone
   -Continue dig if she does not completely respond to amiodarone
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Started on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   -Would not diuresis
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: suspect related to RVR and flash edema.
   If hypoxemia does not respond to rate control will consider PE in
   differential.
   - goal even today
   -Will repeat ABG and VBG
   -Getting TTE with Bubble
   -If negative and she does not return to her baseline with rate control
   will start IV heparin.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - check ABG to make sure she is not retaining
   - hold sedating meds
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   -Tube continues to drain >100cc per day.
   - continue pigtail to water seal
 would consider clamping over weekend
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - Will try to decrease metoprolol with goal to stop if rate controlled
   on amiodarone.
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, subsequent large left effusion, and a trapped lung. The patient underwent pleural catheter placement, which improved her condition. She has been in the ICU for a prolonged stay due to AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation. 

On the floor, she received an open gastrostomy tube placement and was started on tube feeding. Her chest tube remained in place as there continued to be daily drainage of 300-400 cc. The team was screening her for rehab, but today she experienced an episode of AF RVR with a heart rate in the 140s and worsening oxygen requirement. She required a higher flow oxygen mask to maintain mid to high 90s saturation levels. 

She received IV fluid boluses the previous night for low urine output and responded to 2.5 mg IV Lopressor with improvement of heart rate to the 100s. She also received 20 IV Lasix with an 800 cc urine output. Additionally, she received 2 mg IV morphine.

Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient was not talking and appeared uncomfortable. She could not provide any further history. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AF RVR: The patient continues to have episodes of AF RVR,"

 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - re-check C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does
   show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin gtt and lasix gtt last
   night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix gtt to diurese carefully
   - Heparin gtt empirically for Pes
 change to Lovenox today, transition
   to Coumadin
   - following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - un-clamp chest tube to monitor reaccumulation of pleural effusion
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - titrate Lopressor carefully
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - unclamp pigtail, monitor
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix gtt for careful diuresis, avoid boluses
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili

","The patient's progress note indicates that they have been admitted to the ICU with a complex medical history, including schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous pneumonia. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, altered mental status, and a history of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

The patient has undergone several interventions and treatments, including the placement of a pigtail catheter for pleural effusion drainage, initiation of diuretics, and administration of antibiotics. The patient's vital signs show persistent tachycardia and hypoxia despite these interventions.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Recurrent pneumonia: The patient's persistent hypoxia and thick secretions suggest the possibility of recurrent pneumonia. Further investigation is needed to rule out this complication.

2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a left-sided transudative pleural effusion and trapped lung. The effusion has reaccumulated, and the pigtail catheter needs to be unclamped to monitor for any worsening.

3. Aspiration pneumonia: Given the patient's altered mental status and inability to protect their airway, there is a risk of aspiration leading to aspiration pneumonia. The patient's feeding tube has been started to minimize this risk.

4. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requires careful management with rate control medications. The patient's low blood"

 HIGH RISK FOR FALL
 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does
   show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin gtt and lasix gtt last
   night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix gtt to diurese carefully
   - Heparin gtt empirically for PEs
   - following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - titrate back up on Lopressor carefully
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - cont pigtail clamped, monitor
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - continue pigtail to water seal
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix gtt for careful diuresis, avoid boluses
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   Access: PICC

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient has multiple medical complications and conditions. Some potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has a new fever this morning along with leukocytosis and bandemia. Possible sources of infection include recurrent pneumonia, urinary tract infection, pleural fluid, and others. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been started for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) coverage.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has been hypoxic for various reasons during the extended hospital stay. Possible causes include pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), flash pulmonary edema, and possibly a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD). Heparin and Lasix infusions have been started empirically for potential pulmonary embolism (PE) and fluid overload, respectively.

3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The patient was in RVR on admission with rates in the 150's, which responded to IV metoprolol. She has been in and out of AFib since then. Low-dose metoprolol is being continued for rate control, and amiodarone has been started. Additional beta-blocker doses have been required due to persistent tachycardia.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status has fluctuated throughout the hospital course, with some"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and developed a left lower lobe pneumonia, resulting in pleural effusion and trapped lung. The patient required high-flow mask oxygen and bipap at night. A chest CT revealed numerous distal mucous plugs, but bronchoscopy did not show large mucous plugs. Thoracentesis was performed, and the patient had immediate improvement in respiratory status after drainage of transudative fluid. A pigtail catheter was placed, and the patient continues to drain fluid without worsening of effusion. The patient's current condition includes fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, HAP/Aspiration PNA, pleural effusion, and borderline hypotension. The patient is NPO with tube feeding started, and a G tube is in place. She is on various medications including amiodarone, metoprolol, heparin, lasix, and others. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending resolution of pleural effusion and removal of PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Recurrent pneumonia due to thick secretions and mucous plugs in the lungs.
2. Pulmonary edema caused by fluid overload and heart failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 55-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, for which he is receiving heparin sodium infusion. He is also on furosemide (Lasix) for fluid management and metoprolol for blood pressure control. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C (99.7°F), heart rate of 111 bpm with an irregular rhythm indicative of atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 116/46 mmHg to 134/74 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on aerosol-cool delivery device. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a total fluid input of 2,253 mL and output of 1,252 mL, with a fluid balance of +1,001 mL since midnight.

The patient's arterial blood gas (ABG) results indicate a pH of 7.44, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) / fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 220, and other lab values within normal limits.

Physical examination findings include an absence of peripheral vascular pulses assessment, not assessed skin condition, and neurologic assessment deferred due to patient's unresponsiveness.

   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she is not talking and appears uncomfortable.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), and other medical conditions. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and developed a large left effusion, leading to a trapped lung. A Pleurex catheter was placed, continuously producing 400cc/day. An open Jejunostomy (J) tube was also placed. She had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the Pleurex catheter. On the floor, she did well, and her chest tube remained in place due to ongoing drainage. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she experienced AF RVR with a heart rate in the 140s, worsening oxygen requirement, and an increase in chest tube drainage. She received IV fluids, Lopressor, Lasix, and morphine. Upon arrival in the ICU, she was not talking and appeared uncomfortable. She could not provide further history.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory complications: Due to her history of pneumonia, trapped lung, and ongoing chest tube drainage, there is a risk of further respiratory infections or complications such as pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's poorly controlled AF RVR and previous hypotension indicate"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and
   decrease lopressor given marginal BP.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Started on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   -Repeat sputum culture.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shut
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - check for RAI- morning cortisol.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, subsequent large left effusion, and a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, and she underwent an open jejunostomy tube placement. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the pleural catheter. 

Upon returning to the floor, she received intravenous fluids, went into atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and developed worsening oxygen requirements. She was given IV boluses for low urine output, received lopressor to control her heart rate, and received IV lasix. She also received 2 mg IV morphine. 

Upon arrival in the ICU, she was not talking and appeared uncomfortable. She had an oxygen requirement of 70% on high flow mask and was transitioned to PO amiodarone. Her condition worsened, with hypoxemia requiring 35% face mask oxygen. A transesophageal echocardiogram with bubble study showed an atrial septal defect (ASD) and patent foramen ovale (PFO), along with a dilated right ventricle suggestive of a pulmonary embolism (PE). Heparin was started empirically.

   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she is not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.
   24 Hour Events:
   Transitioned to PO amiodarone yesterday.
   Hypoxemic requiring 70% FM

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and developed a large left pleural effusion. A pleural catheter was placed, and she also had an open Jejunostomy tube (J-tube) placed. 

The patient had a prolonged ICU stay due to AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the placement of the pleural catheter. She was started on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and amiodarone for her AF RVR. On the floor, she was doing well, but today she experienced another episode of AF RVR with a heart rate in the 140s and worsening oxygen requirements. She required a high-flow nasal cannula to maintain her oxygen saturation in the mid-to-high 90s.

She received IV fluids the previous night for low urine output and was given lopressor 2.5 mg IV twice, which helped control her heart rate. She also received 20 mg IV lasix with an 800 cc urine output. Additionally, she received 2 mg IV morphine. Upon arrival in the ICU, she was not talking and appeared uncomfortable, unable to provide further history.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise:

   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she is not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and
   decrease lopressor given marginal BP.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage
   -Repeat sputum culture.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - check for RAI- morning cortisol.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,
   and pt clearly expressed desire to remain full code.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation (afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion, leading to a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed to drain the effusion, but it continues to produce 400cc/day of clear drainage. She underwent an open jejunal tube placement and was started on tube feeds. Her prolonged ICU stay was due to afib RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the placement of a pleural catheter.

Upon returning to the ICU, she received IV fluids on the floor and experienced an episode of afib with RVR, along with worsening oxygen requirements. Her heart rate was in the 140s, and she required a HiFlow mask to maintain her oxygen saturation in the mid-to-high 90s. She received IV fluids, lopressor, and morphine, which improved her heart rate to the 100s.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemic respiratory failure, fever, altered mental status, pleural effusion, borderline hypotension, anemia, and schizophrenia. The possible medical complications that can arise include:

   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   -Will amiodarone load and start drip with goal of removing beta
   blockade.
   -Will transition to PO amiodarone
   -Continue dig if she does not completely respond to amiodarone
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Started on empiric Vanc/Zosyn for coverage
   -Would not diuresis
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: suspect related to RVR and flash edema.
   If hypoxemia does not respond to rate control will consider PE in
   differential.
   - goal even today
   -Will repeat ABG and VBG
   -Getting TTE with Bubble
   -If negative and she does not return to her baseline with rate control
   will start IV heparin.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - check ABG to make sure she is not retaining
   - hold sedating meds
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   -Tube continues to drain >100cc per day.
   - continue pigtail to water seal
 would consider clamping over weekend
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   - Will try to decrease metoprolol with goal to stop if rate controlled
   on amiodarone.
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia, developed a large left effusion, and had a pigtail catheter placed. She also has a history of prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation. The patient's current presentation includes worsening oxygen requirement, development of fever, slight bandemia, and altered mental status. She continues to have episodes of AF RVR and has been receiving IV fluids.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia may be related to her AF RVR and flash edema. If rate control does not improve her condition, pulmonary embolism (PE) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Repeating ABG and VBG, getting a transthoracic echo (TTE) with bubble study, and starting IV heparin may be necessary.
2. Fever and Slight Bandemia: The patient has a fever and slight bandemia, indicating a possible infection. Pan culture was done, and empiric Vanc/Zosyn coverage was started. Diuresis should be avoided.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's mental status is altered, possibly due to narcotics. Checking ABG to ensure she is not retaining CO2, holding sedating medications,"

 HIGH RISK FOR FALL
 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - re-check C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does
   show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin gtt and lasix gtt last
   night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix gtt to diurese carefully
   - continue lovenox
   - d/w PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - un-clamp chest tube to monitor reaccumulation of pleural effusion
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - titrate Lopressor carefully
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   - start dilt and d/c lopressor
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix gtt for careful diuresis, avoid boluses
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili

","The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous hospitalization for left lower lobe pneumonia. She has been admitted to the ICU due to recurrent pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and hypoxemia. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia, but continues to have fevers, leukocytosis, and bandemia. She also has a left-sided pleural effusion and trapped lung, which has been managed with chest tube placement and drainage.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on aerosol-cool delivery device. She is currently on mechanical ventilation support.

Her physical examination reveals minimal responsiveness, opening eyes to name but not following commands, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, decreased breath sounds throughout, and no wheezes. She has a well-healed midline surgical scar with a ventral hernia and PEG insertion clean.

Her laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 13.0 x 10^9/L, slightly low hemoglobin of 7.4 g/dL, normal platelet count of 287 x 10^9/L, elevated lactate dehydrogen"

 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 HIGH RISK FOR FALL
 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Fever: New fever this morning as well as leukocytosis and bandemia.
   She has several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural
   fluid. The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - will start Vanc/ Zosyn for now for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - re-check C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does
   show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin gtt and lasix gtt last
   night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix gtt to diurese carefully
   - continue lovenox for empriric PE treatment.
   - following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - un-clamp chest tube to monitor reaccumulation of pleural effusion
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - titrate Lopressor carefully
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix gtt for careful diuresis, avoid boluses
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and previous pneumonia. She was admitted to the ICU due to left lower lobe (LLL) pneumonia, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and respiratory failure requiring bipap and high flow mask oxygen.

She initially received broad-spectrum antibiotics for her pneumonia, which was later narrowed to cefepime. However, she developed large pleural effusions and a trapped lung on the left side. Her respiratory status deteriorated, necessitating the use of noninvasive ventilation.

A chest CT revealed numerous distal mucous plugs, and bronchoscopy did not show large mucous plugs. She underwent thoracentesis and drainage of transudative fluid, but the effusion quickly reaccumulated. An IP placed pigtail catheter was inserted, resulting in immediate drainage of a large clear transudative fluid and improvement in her respiratory status. The pigtail catheter was initially clamped, but later unclamped due to the increased effusion.

The patient also has a history of aspiration pneumonia (HAP/Aspiration PNA #1), for which she completed a course of cefepime. She is currently on Vanc/Zosyn for broad coverage of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).

She has been hypoxic for various reasons during her extended hospital course. Her recent"

   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she was not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), and other medical conditions. She was initially admitted for left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) with a large left effusion, which was treated with a pleurex catheter and an open J-tube placement. She had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, but improved with the pleurex catheter.

On the floor, the patient underwent surgery for open G-tube placement and was started on tube feeding (TF) on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube remained in place due to ongoing drainage of 300-400 cc clear drainage daily. The team was considering her for rehab, but today she experienced a recurrence of AF RVR with a heart rate in the 140s, worsening oxygen requirements, and low urine output.

Interventions:
- IV fluids (IVF) boluses for low urine output
- Lopressor 2.5 mg IV twice to control heart rate
- 20 IV Lasix with 800 cc urine output
- 2 mg IV morphine

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's current assessment includes fever of unknown origin (FUO), high risk for fall, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation (AF).

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory complications: The patient has a history of pneumonia and ongoing chest tube drainage, which increases the risk of respiratory infections and further respiratory compromise.
2. Cardiac complications: The patient's atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response may lead to hemodynamic instability, poor tissue perfusion, and potential cardiac arrhythmias.
3. Infectious complications: The presence of fever of unknown origin suggests the possibility of an ongoing infection, which may require further investigation and treatment.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient has had an open J-tube placement, indicating a risk of gastrointestinal infections or complications related to enteral feeding.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's inability to communicate or provide further history raises concerns about potential neurological deterioration or cognitive impairment.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, respiratory status, cardiac rhythm, fluid balance, and laboratory values to promptly identify and manage any potential complications that may arise."

   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and  change
   lopressor to cardizem.  Will anticoagulate with lovenox-> coumadin for
   afib.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage- will do empiric 8 day course
   given micro samples were subotimal.
   - repeat cdiff
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: now back to her baseline, which is demented.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  She seems to do better from a
   resp standpoint with her CT unclamped.  Given frailty and poor mental
   status Talc pleuradesis not an appealing answer to correct her
   recurrent effusion.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

- She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA), subsequent large left effusion, and a trapped lung.
- She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the placement of a pleural catheter.
- On the floor, she received open gastrostomy tube placement and was started on tube feeding (TF).
- She was transferred back to the ICU due to worsening oxygen requirement and tachycardia.
- Upon arrival, she was not talking and appeared uncomfortable.
- She has a history of an ASD, PFO, and dilated right ventricle suggestive of a previous pulmonary embolism (PE).
- She developed hypoxemic episodes and was placed on 70% HiFlow mask to maintain mid to high 90s oxygen saturation.
- She received IV fluids, lopressor, lasix, and morphine.
- Her current vital signs include a temperature of 36.7 C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 94/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on HiFlow mask.

   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she was not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was placed, and she also had an open J-tube placed. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. She returned to the ICU today after receiving IV fluids on the floor, experiencing atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and desaturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has a history of AFib with RVR, which can lead to an irregular heartbeat and a decrease in cardiac output. This may result in symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, and fatigue. Treatment includes medications like amiodarone and cardizem, along with anticoagulation therapy.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and right ventricular dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism (PE). This can cause inadequate oxygenation of the blood and may require mechanical ventilation support.

   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she was not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.
   Events yesterday ([**2191-5-21**]):
   Transitioned to PO amiodarone yesterday.
   Hypoxemic requiring 70% FM
 now down to 35% FM.
   TTE with bubble done:  ASD PFO noted.  Dilated RV suggestive of PE in
   the past.  Lovenox started.

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and  change
   lopressor to cardizem.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage- will do empiric 8 day course
   given micro samples were subotimal.
   - repeat cdiff
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Unclamp CT and repeat CXR.  Seems as if clamping her CT yesterday was
   associated with worsened resp status.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: now back to her baseline, which is demented.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, stable
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation (AF) who was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and subsequent large left effusion. She had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the placement of a pleural catheter. On the floor, she developed AF RVR and required IV fluids, which led to worsening oxygen requirement. She was started on amiodarone and cardizem for rate control. She also received IV Lasix and morphine.

The patient has a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled AF. She was admitted with LLL PNA and a large left effusion. She underwent a pigtail catheter placement and an open J-tube placement. She had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the pleural catheter. She was transferred back to the ICU due to IV fluids on the floor causing AF RVR and desaturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AF with RVR: The patient continues to have episodes of AF with RVR, which occurred during IV fluid administration. She is currently in atrial flutter. She will continue with PO amiodarone and switch lopressor to cardizem.
2. Fever and slight bandemia: The patient has a fever and a slight"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and
   decrease lopressor given marginal BP.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage
   -Repeat sputum culture.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was admitted initially with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion, possibly due to a trapped lung. She underwent placement of a pigtail catheter, which continuously drained 400cc of fluid per day. An open J-tube was also placed. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. On the floor, she received IV fluids and experienced an episode of AF RVR, leading to worsening oxygen requirements. She was transitioned to PO amiodarone and received IV lasix and morphine. Upon arrival to the ICU, she was not talking and appeared uncomfortable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient has multifactorial hypoxic respiratory failure, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism (PE).
2. Fever and Slight Bandemia: The patient has a fever and slight bandemia, indicating a possible infection. She has been pan-cultured and started on vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage. Repeat sputum cultures"

   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pleurex cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to
   high 90's. She had reportedly received IVF boluses the previous night
   for low UOP. On the floor, she received lopressor 2.5 mg IV X 2 with
   improvement of HR to 100's. She recived 20 IV lasix with 800 cc UOP.
   She also received 2 mg IV morphine.
   Upon arrival to the ICU, she was not talking and appears uncomfortable.
   She cannot relate any further history.

   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - currently in aflutter.  Will continue with po amiodarone and
   decrease lopressor given marginal BP.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage
   -Repeat sputum culture.
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - resend sputum cultures; continue vanco and zosyn for now (day 3)
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She initially presented with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was placed, resulting in continuous drainage of 400cc/day. She also has an open J-tube placed and has been on total parenteral nutrition (TF).

The patient's recent history includes a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the placement of a pleural catheter. On the floor, she received IV fluids, experienced an episode of AF RVR, and required supplemental oxygen to maintain mid to high 90s saturation levels.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition. These include:

1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including HAP (healthcare-associated pneumonia), left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and RV (right ventricular) dysfunction potentially representing PE (pulmonary embolism). Further evaluation is needed, including resending sputum cultures and transitioning to low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for anticoagulation.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 55-year-old male with a chief complaint of fever of unknown origin. The patient has a history of allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The patient has been receiving various antibiotics since admission, including vancomycin, piperacillin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. The patient is also receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis and other medications in the ICU.

 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Fever: Recent fever as well as leukocytosis and bandemia. She has
   several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural fluid.
   The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected. Now 48 hrs afebrile and with resolving
   leukocytosis.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn (day 3) for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - re-check C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin
   gtt and lasix gtt last night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix boluses to diurese 1L neg today
   - continue lovenox instead of heparin to decrease obligate in's
   - d/w PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - continue chest tube to monitor reaccumulation of pleural effusion
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - Lopressor changed to Diltiazem, titrate carefully to 45 QID
   - could consider changing to verapimil as a better nodal [**Doctor Last Name **]
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix boluses for careful diuresis
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and a prolonged hospital course complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, trap lung, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She is currently in the ICU and has several ongoing medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever, Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had recent fevers along with leukocytosis and bandemia. Possible sources include recurrent pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), pleural fluid, among others. Further investigations are needed to identify the cause of the fever.

2. Hypoxemia: Despite fluid removal and thick secretions, the patient remains hypoxic. This may indicate recurrent pneumonia or a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Empirical treatment for PE is being administered, and a bubble study has shown a shunt, likely atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO). Heparin gtt and Lasix gtt have been started.

3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has been in and out of AFib on the floor. She is currently on low-dose metoprolol for rate control, but her heart rate remains elevated. Diltiazem has been added, and the dosing will be titrated carefully. Amiodarone will continue to be administered"

   # Fever: Recent fever as well as leukocytosis and bandemia. She has
   several possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural fluid.
   The persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick
   secretions is concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR
   (obtained at time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site
   looks good and not infected. Now 48 hrs afebrile and with resolving
   leukocytosis.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - continue Vanc/ Zosyn (day 3) for broad coverage of HAP
   - consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - re-check C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. Currently, I suspect a component of pulm edema in setting of
   getting extra IVF and starting TF as well as afib with RVR and possibly
   flash pulm edema. CXR at time of transfer without evidence of worsening
   PTX. No LE swelling, she has been on DVT ppx, but PE also remains on
   differential, although lower suspicion at this time. EKG without signs
   of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of
   possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does
   show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin gtt and lasix gtt last
   night given TTE findings.
   - Lasix boluses to diurese carefully
   - continue lovenox instead of heparin to decrease obligate in's
   - d/w PCP
   [**Name Initial (PRE) **] following [**Hospital1 **] lytes, replete PRN
   - f/u infectious w/u
   - un-clamp chest tube to monitor reaccumulation of pleural effusion
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation - she was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - Lopressor changed to Diltiazem, titrate carefully
   - cont Amiodarone, ASA
   - monitor on tele
   - wil not restart digoxin
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Currently, she is much
   more somnolent per history. I suspect this may be related to morphine.
   By the evening, before temp spike, mental status had improved.
   - hold sedating meds
   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - F/U IP recommendatiosn regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # [**Name (NI) 5860**] pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Borderline hypotension- Her blood pressures have been running in the
   80's-90's systolic during her admission, asymptomatic. Here, blood
   pressure has been 100s recently, but now dipped to SBP 80
s after lasix
   and metoprolol. However, low BP, fever and bandemia could be impending
   sepsis. Given TTE findings, started on Lasix gtt yesterday to carefully
   diurese.
   - cont Lasix boluses for careful diuresis
   - no further interventions if asymptomatic , keep >50 if mentating at
   baseline

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient has had recent fevers along with leukocytosis and bandemia. Possible sources of infection include recurrent pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), pleural fluid, or catheter-related bloodstream infection.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient has been hypoxic for numerous reasons, including pulmonary edema, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), and possibly flash pulmonary edema. A bubble study showed a shunt, likely an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO).

3. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient has a history of AFib, which can increase the risk of stroke. The patient is currently on amiodarone and aspirin for rate control and stroke prevention.

4. Trapped Lung and Pleural Effusion: The patient has a left-sided transudative pleural effusion and trapped lung. The pigtail catheter placed in the pleural space has been draining fluid, but it needs to be monitored closely.

5. Borderline Hypotension: The patient's blood pressures have been running low, especially after receiving lasix and metoprolol. This could be due to sepsis or the diuretic effect of lasix.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU due to a prolonged hospital course complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, trap lung, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current condition includes fever of unknown origin, high risk for falls, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, altered mental status, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), aspiration pneumonia, pleural effusion, ASD/PFO, borderline hypotension, anemia, and schizophrenia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fever of unknown origin: The patient has been experiencing fevers, which could indicate an underlying infection or inflammation. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause.

2. High risk for falls: Due to the patient's altered mental status and physical limitations, she is at a high risk for falls. Measures should be taken to prevent falls and minimize the risk of injury.

3. Hypoxemia: The patient continues to have difficulty maintaining adequate oxygen levels in her blood. This could be due to recurrent pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or an underlying cardiac condition. Continuous monitoring and treatment adjustments are necessary to improve oxygenation.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and it has been present during her hospital stay. Rate control is essential to prevent symptoms such as palpitations, short"

   Resident for key portions of the services provided.  I agree with his /
   her note, including assessment and plan as detailed in my note below.
   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing 400cc/day.  She is s/p a an open J tube placed.
   She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleuxex.
   While on the floor, she has been doing well. Open Gtube was placed by
   surgery on [**2191-5-16**], and she was started on TF on [**5-18**]. Her chest tube
   remained in place as there continued to be 300-400 cc clear drainage
   daily. The team was screening her for rehab. However, today, she went
   into afib with RVR with HR in 140's, developed a worsening oxygen
   requirement (from 2-3L NC to 70% HiFlow mask) to keep sats in mid to

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day past 24 hrs).  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns today
   after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and Dilt
   -If unable to control rate with dilt will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal negative volume status
   # Altered mental status: per team, yesterday, she was still able to
   communicate with team, at times disoriented. Earlier, she was somnolent
   but this was in the setting of narcotics. Currently improving MS.
   - hold sedating meds.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate contorl and negative fluid
   balance.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,
   and pt clearly expressed desire to remain full code.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was inserted, but it continues to produce 400cc/day of fluid. The patient also has a tracheostomy tube (open J tube) in place. She had a prolonged ICU stay due to AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the placement of a pleural catheter. 

The patient experienced an episode of AF RVR while receiving IV fluids on the floor and required supplemental oxygen. Her current vital signs include a heart rate in the 100s, blood pressure of 94/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on HiFlow mask. 

Laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated lactate levels. Blood, urine, and chest tube fluid cultures are negative. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) reveals hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction (70%), right ventricular dilation, mild mitral regurgitation, moderate pulmonary hypertension, and an atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion, which was managed with a pigtail catheter. The patient also has a trapped lung, open J-tube placement, and a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation. She returns today after receiving IV fluids on the floor and experiencing another episode of AF RVR with desaturation.

Assessment and Plan:

1. AFib with RVR: The patient continues to have episodes of AFib with RVR, which occurred during IV fluids administration. The plan is to continue amiodarone and diltiazem. If the heart rate cannot be controlled with diltiazem, a trial of verapamil will be given.

2. Fever and slight bandemia: The patient has a fever and a slight increase in white blood cell count. The plan is to pan culture and start Vanc/Zosyn for coverage. Treatment will be continued for 7 days and then stopped.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and right ventricular dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism ("

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR), hypoxia, and other medical conditions. She has been admitted to the ICU multiple times due to AFib RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with pleural catheter placement. The patient is currently experiencing fever, hypoexmia, and right ventricular (RV) failure. She has a history of large left pleural effusion and a trapped lung with a pigtail catheter in place. The patient is also on long-term antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib with RVR: The patient's episodes of AFib with RVR need to be managed with amiodarone and diltiazem. If the heart rate cannot be controlled with diltiazem, a trial of verapamil may be given.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxic respiratory failure is multifactorial and may be caused by HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and RV dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism (PE) hemodynamics. It is important to continue negative fluid balance and consider anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be related to sedating medications. Holding sedating medications and reassess"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and Dilt
   -If unable to control rate with dilt will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**5-19**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal negative volume status
   -Will need to place on D
c summary treat emperically for PE.
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
   -Will consider diamox
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Continue lasix bolus.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was placed, and she continues to produce pleural fluid at a rate of 250cc per day. She has been in the ICU for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. She returns to the ICU after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into AF RVR and desaturating.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is likely due to multifactorial causes such as HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
2. Fever and Slight Bandemia: The patient has a fever and slight bandemia. She is pan-cultured, and Vanc/Zosyn started on [5-19] for coverage will be treated for 7 days then stopped. Currently, [5-19].
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient is still disoriented but less somnolent. She may have altered mental status due to various factors, including hypoxia, infection, or medications.

   Chief Complaint:  afib with RVR, hypoxia
   HPI:
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   continuously producing now down to 250cc.  She is s/p open J
   tube placed.  She had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension
   and desats that improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns  after
   receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and
   desaturating. Active issues continued pleural drainage, fever,
   hypoexmia and RV failure.

   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (400cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and Dilt
   -If unable to control rate with dilt will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**5-19**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal negative volume status
   -Will need to place on D
c summary treat emperically for PE.
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
   -Will consider diamox
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Continue lasix bolus.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR), hypoxia, and a history of prolonged ICU stay. She returns to the ICU after receiving IV fluids on the floor, experiencing AFib with RVR and desaturation. The patient has a left pleural effusion and a trapped lung with a pigtail catheter in place since 5/10. She also has an open J-tube placed, and her pleural drainage is continuously producing 250cc. The patient's current issues include fever, hypoxemia, right ventricular failure, altered mental status, and borderline hypotension. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. AFib with RVR: The patient continues to have episodes of AFib with RVR, which occurred in the setting of IV fluids. She is currently on amiodarone and diltiazem for rate control. If the rate cannot be controlled with diltiazem, a trial of verapamil will be given.
2. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's hypoxia is multifactorial and may be due to hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and right ventricular dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism (PE) hemodynamics. She will be treated empirically for PE, and anticoagulation will be initiated"

   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and Dilt
   -If unable to control rate with dilt will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**5-19**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal negative volume status
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
   -Will consider diamox
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Continue lasix bolus.
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency

","The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib RVR), and other medical conditions. She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion and trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed to drain the effusion, and she also underwent an open jejunostomy tube placement. She had a prolonged ICU stay for AFib RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. She returns to the ICU after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into AFib RVR and desaturating.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:
1. AFib with RVR: The patient continues to have episodes of AFib with RVR, which occurred in the setting of IV fluids. She is already on amiodarone and diltiazem, and if unable to control the rate with diltiazem, a trial of verapamil may be given.
2. Fever and slight bandemia: The patient has a fever and a slight increase in white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. She was started on vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage, which will be treated for 7 days.
3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, likely due to hospital-acquired pneumonia, left"

   Assessment and Plan
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG yesterday showed increased hypercarbia, pt more arousable later in
   the day however. Increased WBC today concerning for possible infection.
   CXR done today without evidence of [**Date range (1) 3549**] pna. Her PICC and tubes
   looks okay. Aside from hypercarbia and infection, hyponatremia may also
   be contributory.
   - Repeat blood gas today, she may need BiPAP if retaining
   - Check urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture. Could check
   pleural fluid culture as well.
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate a little better today following acetazolamide.
   - Repeating blood gas as above
   - Hold on further diuresis today, BUN/Cr rising, Na dropping c/w
   intravascularly deplete state
   # Hyponatremia
   Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears
   improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Chest tube clamped
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   HR under better control with metoprolol.
   - Increase metoprolol to TID
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # HAP/[**Name (NI) 6220**] PNA Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly covered
   with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has completed
   course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions and a
   trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring bipap
   at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed evidence of
   numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**] did not
   reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - f/u IP recommendations regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's current medical condition and potential medical complications can be summarized as follows:

1. Hypoxia: The patient has been hypoxic for an extended period due to various reasons, including prolonged hospitalization, pneumonia, and a possible shunt or ASD/PFO.

2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient initially presented with AFib with RVR, which required treatment with IV metoprolol. Since then, she has been on low-dose metoprolol for rate control. The patient's heart rate is currently under better control, but there is a need to increase the dose of metoprolol to TID.

3. Mental Status Changes: The patient has a baseline of schizophrenia and poor mental status, which may contribute to the difficulty in assessing her mental status changes. Further evaluation is necessary.

4. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, likely due to hypovolemia. Further diuresis should be held off, and PM electrolytes should be checked.

5. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, possibly caused by diuresis, underlying hypercarbia, and resulting metabolic alkalosis. Repeating blood gas and bicarbonate levels should be done.

6. Pleural Effusion: The patient has left-sided transudative pleural effusion and trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was"

   Recent fever as well as leukocytosis and bandemia. She has several
   possible sources including recurrent pna, UTI, pleural fluid. The
   persistant hypoxia depsite fluid removal as well as thick secretions is
   concerning for recurrent PNA, although this mornings CXR (obtained at
   time of spike) does not look much worse. The G tube site looks good and
   not infected. Now 48 hrs afebrile and with resolving leukocytosis.
   - f/u blood cx, urine cx, sputum cx, pleural fluid cx, stool cx
   - Continue Vanc/ Zosyn (Day 1: [**5-20**]; plan for 7 days) for broad coverage

   - Consider exchanging PICC if no improvement
   - Recheck C.diff to r/o x3
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Started on heparin
   gtt and lasix gtt last night given TTE findings.

   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   - Continue diltiazem, titrate up carefully; consider changing to

   # HAP/Aspiraton PNA #1 - Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly
   covered with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has
   completed course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions
   and a trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring
   bipap at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed
   evidence of numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**]
   did not reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU due to left lower lobe pneumonia, trap lung, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's current conditions include chronic pleural effusion, fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pleural Effusion, Chronic: The patient has a left-sided transudative pleural effusion with a trapped lung. She underwent thoracentesis and drainage of transudative fluid, which improved her respiratory status. A pigtail catheter was placed, resulting in the drainage of 1L of fluid. The chest tube drainage is less than 100 cc/day, and the decision will be made to pull the tube if this continues.
2. Fever, Unknown Origin: The patient's fever has resolved, but her white blood cell count is still elevated, indicating a possible infection. Further cultures will be obtained to rule out recurrent pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or other potential sources.
3. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirement has not improved despite fluid removal and clearing of secretions. A bubble study confirmed the presence of a shunt, likely an atrial septal defect (ASD) or patent foramen ovale (PFO). She was started on heparin gtt and Lasix g"

   Assessment and Plan
   86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, HTN called
   out from MICU after prolonged hospital course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG yesterday showed increased hypercarbia, pt more arousable later in
   the day however. Increased WBC today concerning for possible infection.
   CXR done today without evidence of [**Date range (1) 3549**] pna. Her PICC and tubes
   looks okay. Aside from hypercarbia and infection, hyponatremia may also
   be contributory.
   - Repeat blood gas today, she may need BiPAP if retaining
   - Check urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture. Could check
   pleural fluid culture as well.
   - Change foley
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate a little better today following acetazolamide.
   - Repeating blood gas as above
   - Hold on further diuresis today, BUN/Cr rising, Na dropping c/w
   intravascularly deplete state
   - Will give 20meq KCL
   # Hyponatremia
   Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears
   improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   HR under better control with metoprolol.
   - Increase metoprolol to TID. If BP dropping will change to metoprolol.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

   Code status: Full code, discuss with HCP, social work and ?ethics
   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and hypertension. She was admitted to the ICU after a prolonged hospital course complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, tracheal malposition (trap lung), and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. 

The patient's current condition includes mental status change, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, hypoxia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and ASD/PFO (atrial septal defect/patent foramen ovale). 

Key findings and plans include:
- Mental status change: The patient has poor baseline wit due to underlying schizophrenia, but there is a possibility of infection or other causes contributing to her mental status changes.
- Metabolic alkalosis: This is likely due to diuresis with some underlying baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
- Hyponatremia: Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia, which may be related to intravascularly depleted state. Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
- Hypoxia: The patient has been hypoxic for numerous reasons. PE (pulmonary embolism) remains on the differential, and will be treated empirically. EKG does not show signs of right heart strain, but VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,"

   CXR done today without evidence of [**Date range (1) 3549**] pna. Her PICC and tubes
   looks okay.
   - Repeat blood gas today, she may need BiPAP if retaining
   - Check urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture. Could check
   pleural fluid culture as well.
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate a little better today following acetazolamide.
   - Repeating blood gas as above
   - Hold on further diuresis today, BUN/Cr rising, Na dropping c/w
   intravascularly deplete state
   # Hyponatremia
   Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears
   improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Chest tube clamped
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   HR under better control with metoprolol.
   - Increase metoprolol to TID
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # HAP/[**Name (NI) 6220**] PNA Pt initially admitted with LLL PNA broadly covered
   with antibiotics then narrowed to cefepime for which she has completed
   course. She subsequently developed large pleural effusions and a
   trapped lung on the left. Resp status deteriorated to requiring bipap
   at night and high flow mask constantly. Chest CT revealed evidence of
   numerous distal mucous plugs. However, Bronchoscopy on [**5-7**] did not
   reveal large mucous plugs. She then underwent thoracentesis and
   drainage of transudative fluid X 1, however, it quickly reaccumulated
   and she received an IP placed pigtail catheter with immediate drainage
   of large clear transudative fluid and improvement of her resp status
   back down to nasal cannula. She developed a small pneumothorax which
   was not symptomatic. Repeat CXR with increased effusion so pigtail
   unclamped and has drained 1 L.  Pigtail re-clamped yesterday, without
   worsening of effusion on CXRs since. Weaning O2 slowly.
   - if chest tube drainage less than 100 cc/day, can consider pulling the
   tube
   - cont chest PT, suctioning
   - wean 02 as tolerated
   - Xopenex/Ipratropium nebs
   - f/u IP recs
   # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion and
   trap lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place. Had decreased BS on exam
   and slight increase in SOB so repeat CXR obtained which showed
   increased left sided effusion since pigtail clamped. Pigtail unclamped
   and has drained >100cc per day.
   - unclamp pigtail
   - f/u IP recommendations regarding pigtail, when to remove
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor

","Summary:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and chronic left lower lobe pneumonia. She was admitted to the MICU after being called out from the floor due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has had a prolonged hospital course complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, trap lung, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

The patient's current conditions include pleural effusion, chronic; fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia); high risk for fall; hypoxemia; atrial fibrillation (AFIB). She also has a history of mental status change, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, and hypoxia.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Pleural effusion, chronic: Continue empiric LMWH for PE; continue empiric vanc/zosyn for PNA. Currently on day 6, plan to complete 8-day course.
2. Fever, unknown origin (FUO, hyperthermia, pyrexia): Repeat blood gas today; she may need BiPAP if retaining; check urinalysis and urine culture, blood culture. Could check pleural fluid culture as well.
3. High risk for fall: Monitor closely for any falls.
4. Hypoxemia: Continue empiric LMWH for PE; continue empiric vanc/zosyn for P"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (200cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and metoprolol 25mg tid
   -If hypotensive will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**6-20**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal even volume status
   -tritrate FI02
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Hold lasix given hyponatremia
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   #Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,
   and pt clearly expressed desire to remain full code.

   -Ethics consult [**Doctor First Name **] to talk with guardian and PCP willing to be
   involved in discussions. She will not do well if she does end up on
   ventilator for progressive sepsis/ aspiration PNA given severe comorbid
   medical issues and poor mentation
   Dispo: Pending resolution of pleural effusion, removal of [**Hospital 1650**] rehab
   placement . prognosis is poor given age and severity of medical issues

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation (afib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was placed, which is continuously draining fluid (currently at 170 cc/day). She also has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, known as an open J tube, placed.

The patient has had a prolonged stay in the ICU due to afib with RVR, hypotension, and desaturation. She is currently experiencing episodes of afib with RVR, particularly after receiving IV fluids on the floor. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/45 to 135/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on 40% FiO2. She is on aerosol-cool oxygen delivery and her arterial blood gas (ABG) shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2 of 129 mmHg.

Physical examination findings include alertness with confusion, inability to appreciate jugular venous pressure (JVP), irregular heartbeat"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (200cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and metoprolol 25mg tid
   -If hypotensive will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**6-20**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal even volume status
   -tritrate FI02
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Hold lasix given hyponatremia
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   #Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion and trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, and she continues to produce pleural fluid (170 cc currently). She also has an open J-tube for feeding.

The patient's current issues include ongoing pleural drainage, fever, hypoxemia, and right ventricular (RV) failure. She has been receiving IV fluids, diamox, lasix, and switched back to metoprolol. Her allergies include sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol.

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 101 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 113/45 to 135/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on aerosol-cool with ABG values of pH 7.39, PaCO2 64 mmHg, and SaO2 129%.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR), and other medical conditions. She has been admitted multiple times to the ICU for various issues including AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with pleural catheter placement. 

The patient's current presentation includes ongoing episodes of AF RVR, fever, hypoxemia, and right ventricular failure. She has a left-sided transudative pleural effusion and trapped lung with a pigtail catheter in place since May 10th. The patient also has a long-term indwelling J-tube for nutritional support. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14.8 K/uL, elevated lactic acid levels, and mildly decreased albumin levels. Her electrolytes are within normal limits, but her renal function is impaired with elevated creatinine levels. 

The potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's history of AF RVR and right ventricular failure indicates ongoing cardiac dysfunction. The ongoing episodes of AF RVR need to be controlled to prevent further hemodynamic instability and hypoxemia.

2. Respiratory Complications: The patient's trapped lung and pleural effusion contribute to her hypoxemic respiratory failure. Management of"

   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hosp
   course. PE also remains on differential, and will treat emprically for
   PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note, VBG shows very
   high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG correlate well,
   but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears
   improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor. She has been continued on low dose metoprolol since her
   admission for rate control, currently on PO lpressor. Lopressor
   frequency decreased yesterday but she became tachycardic for most of
   the night, requiring additional BB doses. Not limited by hypotension.
   HR under better control with metoprolol.
   - Increase metoprolol to TID. If BP dropping will change to metoprolol.
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: pt failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided information, the patient's chief complaints are pneumonia and atrial fibrillation. The 24-hour events include a positive urine analysis, Foley catheter change, and a switch in medication from metoprolol to verapamil for rate control due to the patient's blood pressure in the 80s. The patient also experienced dryness, so free water intake was increased and afternoon sodium levels were checked. Ethics were called regarding the patient's code status, which is currently set to full code.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, haloperidol, and unknown allergies to olanzapine, risperidone, and propranolol.

The patient's last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 05/25/2191 at 09:00 AM and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/25/2191 at 11:39 PM.

Infusions include famotidine (Pepcid) started on 05/25/2191 at 09:00 AM, enoxaparin (Lovenox) started on 05/25/2191 at 08:29 PM, and other ICU medications.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the noted events. Flowsheet data as of 05/26/2191 06:50 AM shows vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and physical examination findings.

The patient's lab results include white blood cell count (WBC) ranging from 10.7 to 14.8 thousand/mm^3, hematocrit (Hct) ranging from 23.2 to 28.8%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 288 to 439 thousand/mm^3, creatinine (Cr) ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 mg/dL, blood glucose levels ranging from 101 to 138 mg/dL, and other lab values.

Microbiology cultures show negative results for blood samples taken on 05/20/2191, 05/26/2191, and pleural fluid sample taken on 05/06/2191. Stool cultures for Clostridium difficile are negative. Urine cultures show klebsiella and yeast growth, and chest X-ray reveals a decreased right pleural effusion and left lower lobe atelectasis.

Assessment and plan include mental status change, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, hypoxia, pleural effusion, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ASD/PFO, aspiration, schizophrenia, anemia, and ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and other comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia, trap lung, atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and mental status changes. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. She is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

The patient has been diagnosed with several medical complications, including hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, hypoxia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, ASD/PFO (atrial septal defect/patent foramen ovale), aspiration, schizophrenia, anemia, and possible urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and platelet count within normal range. The blood cultures are pending, and the patient has positive urine culture for yeast.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include worsening of pneumonia, further mental status deterioration, progression of atrial fibrillation, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobilization, and worsening of hyponatremia."

   interstitial abnormality is probably edema. Heart size is not enlarged.
   Assessment and Plan: 86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation in and out of MICU with course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended
   hospital course. PE also remains on differential, and have been
   treating emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of
   note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat
   ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely
   ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Titrate verapamil
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia:  Trended down to 23.2 ([**5-26**]).  LDH and bili also not
   elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency

   interstitial abnormality is probably edema. Heart size is not enlarged.
   Assessment and Plan: 86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation in and out of MICU with course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   # Hypoxia: She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended
   hospital course. PE also remains on differential, and have been
   treating emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of
   note, VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat
   ABG/VBG correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely
   ASD/PFO.  Hypoxia appears improved.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 6, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Continue verapamil
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and a current admission complicated by left lower lobe pneumonia, aspiration risk, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient's mental status has been fluctuating, and she has shown signs of increased hypercarbia, infection (positive urine analysis), and hyponatremia.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Mental status change: The patient's baseline mental status is poor, underlying schizophrenia, and recent changes may be attributed to hypercarbia, infection, or hyponatremia.
2. Infection: Positive urine analysis suggests a possible urinary tract infection. Blood cultures are pending.
3. Hyponatremia: Suspected hypovolemic hyponatremia with slightly low sodium levels. Further evaluation and treatment are needed.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be due to diuresis, baseline hypercarbia, and resulting metabolic alkalosis. Bicarbonate levels have improved.
5. Hypoxia: The patient has been hypoxic due to various reasons. A bubble study shows shunt, likely ASD/PFO. Oxygenation appears improved.
6. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The patient has been in and out of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Verapamil was started to control the heart rate.

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, chronic pleural effusion, fever of unknown origin, high risk for falls, hypoxemia, and other comorbidities. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments. The vital signs are stable with a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 117 bpm, blood pressure of 135/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96% on nasal cannula. The patient's fluid balance shows a net input of 2,439 mL and output of 2,360 mL, resulting in a balance of 79 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of 7.39/64/129/32/11. The physical examination findings are largely not assessed due to the patient's unresponsive state. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient has multiple imaging studies mentioned but no specific findings are provided.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition and medical history include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's hypoxemia and fever of unknown origin may increase the risk of pneumonia, especially given the use of mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (200cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR suspect
   component of volume depletetion.  Also question if worsening left sided
   process increasing respiratory demand.
   - continue amiodarone and will give bolus fluid and 1 unit PRBC
   - Will titrate up the verapamil each dose and consider a drip
   #hyponatermia-stop free water and follow.
   -Normal saline 500 cc bolus
   #Fever-and slight bandemia improved, fever continues
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 8 days then stop
   currently [**7-20**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: currently improved oxygenation however
   increased respiratoy rate and drop in bicarbonate
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-accumulation of
   pleural effusion and it has racummulated on multiple attempts.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin when more stables indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.
   -Continue to titrate FI02
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented with increased somulence
   - Drop in Bicarb will have a low threshold to send gas will start with
   VBG.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place which appears to
   have moved to more peripheral placement.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Hold lasix given Na and suspect volume depletion, wil need pRBC
   today
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   -Will transfuse [**1-14**]  unit to day to see if helps with tachycardia
   #Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] [**Name10 (NameIs) **]:

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA), subsequent large left effusion, and a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, but the patient continues to produce over 200 cc of fluid per day. She also has an open J-tube placed.

The patient has had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. She returns to the ICU after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into AF RVR, and desaturating.

The patient's current issues include continued pleural drainage, fever, hypoexmia (low oxygen levels), and right ventricular (RV) failure. She has positive findings for Foley catheter, increased free water, and an ethics consult called.

The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. Her last dose of antibiotics was vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) on 05/25/2191 at 09:00 AM and 11:39 PM, respectively.

The patient's medications include amiodarone, famotidine, enoxaparin,"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (200cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR this
   occurred in the setting of IV fluids
   - continue amiodarone and metoprolol 25mg tid
   -If hypotensive will give trial of verapamil.
   #Fever-and slight bandemia
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 7 days then stop
   currently [**6-20**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure:
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-caccumulation of
   pleural effusion.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin.  There is an indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue goal even volume status
   -tritrate FI02
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented but less somulent
   -Will check gas for alkalemia given elevated bicarb
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube may be an option. Will discuss with IP.
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Hold lasix given hyponatremia
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   #Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,
   and pt clearly expressed desire to remain full code.

   ventilator for progressive sepsis/ aspiration PNA given severe comorbid
   medical issues and poor mentation

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. She was admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and developed a large left effusion, resulting in a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, and she has been producing approximately 170 cc of fluid per day. She also has an open J-tube placed. The patient had a prolonged ICU stay due to atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with pleural catheter placement. She returns after receiving IV fluids on the floor and experienced episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and desaturation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which is multifactorial. It could be caused by hospital-acquired pneumonia, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt, and right ventricular dysfunction potentially representing pulmonary embolism hemodynamics.
2. Fever and Slight Bandemia: The patient has a fever and a slight increase in white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. She has been pan-cultured and started on Vancomycin and Zosyn for coverage, which will be treated for 7 days.
3. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response: The patient continues to have episodes of atrial fibrillation with rapid vent"

   Assessment and Plan
   86 year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, poorly
   controlled AF c RVR initially admitted with LLL PNA subsequent large
   left effusion and ? trapped lung s/p pigtail cathter that is
   coninuously producing (200cc/day).  She is s/p open J tube placed.  She
   had a prolonged ICU stay for afib RVR, hypotension and desats that
   improved with the pleural catheter.  She returns after receiving IV
   fluids on the floor, going into afib with RVR and desaturating.
   #Afib with RVR-She continues to have episodes of Afib with RVR suspect
   component of volume depletetion.  Also question if worsening left sided
   process increasing respiratory demand.
   - continue amiodarone and will give bolus fluid and 1 unit PRBC
   - Will titrate up the verapamil each dose and consider a drip
   #hyponatermia-stop free water and follow.
   -Normal saline 500 cc bolus
   #Fever-and slight bandemia improved, fever continues
   -Pan cultured
   -Vanc/Zosyn started [**5-19**] for coverage will treat for 8 days then stop
   currently [**7-20**].
   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: currently improved oxygenation however
   increased respiratoy rate and drop in bicarbonate
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-accumulation of
   pleural effusion and it has racummulated on multiple attempts.
   - transition to lovenox
 coumadin when more stables indication for
   anticoagulation for afib.  Will not do confirmatory testing for PE.
   -Continue to titrate FI02
   # Altered mental status: Still disoriented with increased somulence
   - Drop in Bicarb will have a low threshold to send gas will start with
   VBG.
    # Pleural effusion: Pt has left sided transudative pleural effusion
   and trapped lung with pigtail (placed [**5-10**]) in place which appears to
   have moved to more peripheral placement.
   - suspect a component of trapped lung.  Once HR well controlled will
   need to reassess catheter drainage i.e. Talc pleuradesis through the
   tube vrs VATs and decortication and manual pleuradesis..
   # Borderline hypotension-  Goal rate control and negative fluid
   balance.( if needed with albumin)
   -Hold lasix given Na and suspect volume depletion
   #. Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia- Currently stable, recent baseline HCT 25-28. LDH and bili
   also not elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - continue to monitor
   -Will transfuse 1 unit to day to see if helps with tachycardia
   #Code status: This was readdressed with the patient, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] guardian,
   and pt clearly expressed desire to remain full code.
   Communication: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2084**] Guardian [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5691**] or [**Telephone/Fax (1) 5692**]
   -Ethics consult [**Doctor First Name **] to talk with guardian and PCP willing to be
   involved in discussions. She will not do well if she does end up on
   ventilator for progressive sepsis/ aspiration PNA given severe comorbid
   medical issues and poor mentation
   Dispo: Pending resolution of pleural effusion, removal of [**Hospital 1650**] rehab
   placement . prognosis is poor given age and severity of medical issues

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA) and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion with a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, which is continuously producing over 200 cc of fluid per day. She also has an open J-tube placed. 

The patient's current condition includes ongoing episodes of AF RVR, hypoxia, and fever. Her respiratory support consists of oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, with a current oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 96% on 4 liters of oxygen. The arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis shows a pH of 7.39, PaCO2 of 64 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 322. 

Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left side, a more prominent jugular venous pulse (JVP), and irregular heart rhythm. 

Laboratory results indicate hyponatremia (sodium level of 105 mg/dL), elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 14.8 K/uL, and anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7.4 g/dL. Other lab values, including creatinine (Cr), blood"

   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Hypoxia:
   [**Month/Year (2) **] respiratory status overnight, possibly recurrent aspiration
   event give RLL infiltrate and [**Month/Year (2) 3549**] leukocytosis today. Consider
   also mucous plugging, though less likely to account for leukocytosis.
   Did not appear to be in significant pulmonary edema.
   She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hospital
   course. PE also remains on differential, and have been treating
   emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note,
   VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG
   correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.
   Hypoxia appears improved as now down to 4L NC.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - On empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 8, plan to complete
   8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day (drained 280 after
   midnight)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? from cdiff given diarrhea.  ? from aspiration event.
   - send cdiff (although priors have been negative).
   - start flagyl empirically
   - would change from zosyn to [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro if goals continue to be
   aggressive care for possible resistant gram negative coverage
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   - check urine electrolytes
   - Bolus w/ NS for possible hypovolemic component
   # Pleural effusion: Still draining so will speak w/ IP about possible
   pleurodesis.  Although exudative, not c/w empyemia
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Titrate verapamil (will need to decrease today given low BP)
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, admitted to the ICU for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and respiratory status. She has been complicated by lower left lobe pneumonia, aspiration event, hypoxia, leukocytosis, and an ASD/PFO. The patient's mental status changes are likely due to underlying schizophrenia, increased hypercarbia, infection, and hyponatremia. She also has metabolic alkalosis, hypovolemic hyponatremia, pleural effusion, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently NPO and on TFs with a G-tube in place. She is on various medications including verapamil, amiodarone, lovenox, ASA, depakote, and perphenazine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing ongoing hypoxia, which can be caused by pneumonia, aspiration events, ASD/PFO, or mucous plugging. It is important to continue respiratory support and consider further investigations to identify the underlying cause.
2. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating a possible infection. Empirical treatment for pneumonia and c.difficile has been initiated, and additional tests such as urine and blood cultures are pending.
3. Mental status changes: The patient's mental status changes could be attributed to underlying schizophrenia, hypercarbia, infection"

   # Hypoxia:
   [**Month/Year (2) **] respiratory status overnight, possibly recurrent aspiration
   event give RLL infiltrate and [**Month/Year (2) 3549**] leukocytosis today. Consider
   also mucous plugging, though less likely to account for leukocytosis.
   Did not appear to be in significant pulmonary edema.
   She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hospital
   course. PE also remains on differential, and have been treating
   emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note,
   VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG
   correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.
   Hypoxia appears improved as now down to 4L NC.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Continue empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 8, plan to
   complete 8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day (drained 280 after
   midnight)
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   - check urine electrolytes
   - Bolus w/ NS for possible hypovolemic component
   # Pleural effusion: Still draining so will speak w/ IP about possible
   pleurodesis.  Although exudative, not c/w empyemia
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Titrate verapamil
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia:  Trended down to 23.2 ([**5-26**]).  LDH and bili also not

","Summary:
The patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, who was admitted to the ICU for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and later diagnosed with lower lobe pneumonia. She has been experiencing shortness of breath, hypoxia, and mental status changes. Her current medications include verapamil, amiodarone, lovenox, ASA, depakote, and perphenazine. She has a central line, PICC line, and is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula. Her labs show leukocytosis, hyponatremia, metabolic alkalosis, anemia, and elevated lactate levels.

Potential medical complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's respiratory status has been unstable, possibly due to recurrent aspiration events, mucous plugging, pneumonia, or a shunt like ASD/PFO.
2. Mental status change: The patient has poor baseline mental status due to underlying schizophrenia, but there may be additional contributing factors such as hypercarbia, infection, or hyponatremia.
3. Infection: The patient has increased WBC count and positive urine analysis, suggesting a possible infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending.
4. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which could be related to diuresis and baseline hypercarbia.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which may be hypovolemic in nature"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with shortness of breath. They have a history of atrial fibrillation, for which they were receiving verapamil. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with decreased intravascular volume contributing to poor rate control. They were transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells but experienced desaturation to 70%, requiring placement on a nasal respiratory bypass (NRB) mask. Despite this, their oxygen saturation remained in the low 80s. Morphine and lasix were administered with little improvement. The patient is unable to provide a medical history due to encephalopathy. They have multiple allergies and are currently on various medications, including antibiotics.

24-hour events:
- Made DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Do Not Intubate)
- Transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells
- Uptitrated verapamil with seeming good effect early in the day
- Desaturated to 70% overnight and placed on NRB but struggling to maintain low 80s on NRB
- Gave morphine and lasix with little improvement

Vital signs:
- Temperature: 37.2°C (99°F)
- Tcurrent: 35.7°C (96.3°F)
- Heart rate: 107 bpm (101-129 bpm)

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with a history of schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia (LLL PNA), subsequent large left effusion, and a trapped lung. A pigtail catheter was placed, which is continuously producing over 200 cc of fluid per day. She also has an open J-tube placed. The patient has had a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation, which improved with the pleural catheter. She returns after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into AF RVR and desaturating. Active issues include pleural drainage, fever, hypoxemia, and right ventricular failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, indicating hyponatremia. This condition needs to be addressed by stopping free water and following up on the patient's electrolyte levels.

2. New infiltrate: The patient has developed a new infiltrate in the right lower lobe of the lung. This could indicate a new infection, such as hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The current antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) should be continued due to the concern for aspiration. Additionally, Flagyl should be started to address the elevated white blood cell count.

3. Hypoxic Respiratory Failure"

","Summary:
The patient is a 68-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. He has a history of unknown allergies to sulfonamides, olanzapine, risperidone, propranolol, and haloperidol. The patient is currently receiving various medications including antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam), famotidine, enoxaparin, furosemide, and morphine sulfate. He has been experiencing fever of unknown origin, hypoxemia, atrial fibrillation, and is at high risk for falls. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with an elevated heart rate and low blood pressure. His respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through a nasal cannula, and his ABG results indicate respiratory acidosis with hypercapnia. The patient has pleural effusion, hypoxemia, and atrial fibrillation. The labs show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, and sodium levels. The patient's renal function is within normal limits, and his liver function tests are mildly elevated. The patient's nutrition is being provided through enteral feeding. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's fever of unknown origin, elevated white blood cell count, and unstable vital signs may indicate an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not properly managed.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis"

   # Hypoxic Respiratory Failure: currently improved oxygenation however
   increased respiratoy rate and drop in bicarbonate
   Multifactorial: Likely HAP, left pleural effusion, intracardiac shunt
   and RV dysfunction potentially representing PE hemodynamics.
   - Unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-accumulation of
   pleural effusion and it has racummulated on multiple attempts.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old woman with schizophrenia, recurrent aspiration, and poorly controlled atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF RVR). She was initially admitted with left lower lobe pneumonia and subsequently developed a large left pleural effusion. A pigtail catheter was placed, which is continuously producing over 200 cc/day of fluid. She also has a nasogastric (NG) tube and an open jejunostomy (J) tube.

The patient's medical history includes a prolonged ICU stay for AF RVR, hypotension, and desaturation that improved with the pleural catheter. She returns after receiving IV fluids on the floor, going into AF RVR, and desaturating. Active issues include continuous pleural drainage, fever, hypoexmia, and right ventricular failure.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C (99°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure of 107/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on nasal cannula. She is in AF with irregular rhythm. Her physical examination reveals decreased breath sounds on the left, more tachypnea, and no jugular venous distention.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 23.8 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, sodium of 138 mg/dL, potassium of 4.6 mEq/L, creatinine of 0.7 mg/dL, and platelet count of 387 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Plan:
1. Continue amiodarone and verapamil for AF RVR.
2. Stop free water and follow for hyponatremia.
3. Continue Vanc/Zosyn for new infiltrate and concern for aspiration.
4. Start flagyl for elevated WBC and possible C. Diff colitis.
5. Transition to lovenox and coumadin when more stable for anticoagulation.
6. Titrate FiO2 and unclamp CT transiently to evaluate possibility of re-accumulation of pleural effusion.
7. Continue to monitor anemia and iron studies.
8. Discuss transition to comfort care if she continues to decline.
9. DNR/DNI status and ICU care continue."

   Urine ([**5-25**], [**5-27**]):  Yeast
   CXR ([**5-27**]):  In comparison with the study of [**5-26**], there is increased
   aeration at the left base with visualization of the hemidiaphragm,
   consistent with some resolution of atelectasis and drainage of pleural
   effusion through the pigtail catheter. Atelectatic changes with
   blunting of the costophrenic angle persists on the right. There is
   again prominence of vascular markings consistent with elevated
   pulmonary venous pressure.
   Assessment and Plan: 86F with PMH schizoprenia, paroxysmal atrial
   fibrillation in and out of MICU with course complicated by LLL
   pneumonia, trap lung, AF with RVR.
   # Hypoxia: [**Date Range **] respiratory status over [**Date range (1) 6449**], possibly
   recurrent aspiration event give RLL infiltrate and [**Date range (1) 3549**]
   leukocytosis [**5-27**]. Consider also mucous plugging, though less likely to
   account for leukocytosis. Did not appear to be in significant pulmonary
   edema.
   She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hospital
   course. PE also remains on differential, and have been treating
   emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note,
   VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG
   correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.
   Hypoxia appears improved as now down to 4L NC.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - Completed course of vanc/zosyn ([**5-28**])
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day (drained 280 after
   midnight)
   .
   # Diarrhea: ? from cdiff given diarrhea.
   - Send c.diff (although priors have been negative).
   - Continue flagyl empirically
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA.  As of [**5-28**], continues to be
   poor.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Resolved.
    # Pleural effusion: Still draining so will speak w/ IP about possible
   pleurodesis.  Although exudative, not c/w empyemia
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Titrate verapamil (will need to decrease today given low BP)
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia:  Trended down to 23.2 ([**5-26**]).  LDH and bili also not
   elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency.  Was tranfused one unit
   of pRBC on [**5-26**].

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a medical history of schizophrenia, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and previous lung problems. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for multiple reasons, including hypoxia, altered mental status, diarrhea, and anemia.

From the note, it is evident that the patient is experiencing respiratory issues. The patient's oxygen saturation (SpO2) is consistently below the normal range of 95-100%, indicating hypoxia. This could be due to recurrent aspiration events, mucous plugging, or a possible pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient has been treated empirically for PE, and further tests are pending.

The patient also has a history of diarrhea, which could be related to Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The healthcare team has started sending tests for C. diff and will continue empirical treatment with Flagyl.

The patient's mental status has been poor, with significant changes noted in the progress note. These changes include increased hypercarbia, increased white blood cell count, and a positive urinalysis, suggesting an infection. Blood and urine cultures are pending, and the Foley catheter has been changed.

The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be caused by diuresis and underlying hypercarbia. The bicarbonate level has improved.

Hyponatremia has resolved, and the patient still has a pleural effusion that is being"

   # Hypoxia:
   [**Month/Year (2) **] respiratory status overnight, possibly recurrent aspiration
   event give RLL infiltrate and [**Month/Year (2) 3549**] leukocytosis today. Consider
   also mucous plugging, though less likely to account for leukocytosis.
   Did not appear to be in significant pulmonary edema.
   She has been hypoxic for numerous reasons this extended hospital
   course. PE also remains on differential, and have been treating
   emprically for PE. EKG without signs of right heart strain. Of note,
   VBG shows very high Pao2 suggestive of possible shunt. Repeat ABG/VBG
   correlate well, but Bubble study does show shunt, likely ASD/PFO.
   Hypoxia appears improved as now down to 4L NC.
   - Continue empiric LMWH for PE
   - On empiric vanc/zosyn for pna. Currently on day 8, plan to complete
   8d course.
   - Clamp chest tube when draining <100cc/day (drained 280 after
   midnight)
   .
   # Leukocytosis: ? from cdiff given diarrhea.  ? from aspiration event.
   - send cdiff (although priors have been negative).
   - start flagyl empirically
   - would change from zosyn to [**Last Name (un) **]/cipro if goals continue to be
   aggressive care for possible resistant gram negative coverage
   # Mental status change:  Poor baseline wit underlying schizophrenia
   though MS [**First Name (Titles) 3548**] [**Last Name (Titles) 3549**] over [**Date range (1) 6300**].
   VBG [**5-24**] showed increased hypercarbia. Increased WBC ([**5-25**]) concerning
   for possible infection with positive UA. Aside from hypercarbia and
   infection, hyponatremia may also be contributory.
   - Urine culture and blood culture pending
   - Foley changed ([**5-25**])
   - Treat hyponatremia as below
   # Metabolic alkalosis:  [**Month (only) 8**] be from diuresis with some underlying
   baseline hypercarbia and resulting metabolic alkalosis.
   Bicarbonate improved ([**5-26**]).
   # Hyponatremia:  Suspect hypovolemic hyponatremia.  Slightly [**Month/Year (2) 3549**]
   (5/13/
 [**5-26**]).
   - Hold off on further diuresis today and check PM electrolytes.
   - Decrease free water in TF
   - check urine electrolytes
   - Bolus w/ NS for possible hypovolemic component
   # Pleural effusion: Still draining so will speak w/ IP about possible
   pleurodesis.  Although exudative, not c/w empyemia
   # Paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation:  She was in RVR on admission with
   rate in the 150's responded to IV metoprolol x2. In and out of Afib on
   floor.  Has been hypotensive on lopressor so verapamil started ([**5-25**]).
   - Titrate verapamil (will need to decrease today given low BP)
   - Continue Amiodarone
   - Continue lovenox/ASA
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Will not restart digoxin
   # ASD/PFO
   - Continue to monitor
   # Aspiration: Failed video swallow and is currently NPO. In the ICU
   question was raised whether aspiration is [**2-14**] stroke but no new focal
   neurological signs. G tube placed and TFs started
   - NPO
   - TFs started
   # Schizophrenia: Stable.
   - Continue depakote and perphenazine
   # Anemia:  Trended down to 23.2 ([**5-26**]).  LDH and bili also not
   elevated. Iron studies not c/w iron deficiency
   - Given tachycardia, hypovolemia, will give 1 U PRBC today

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, currently admitted to the ICU for altered mental status, hypoxia, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation. The patient has had multiple complications during her hospital course, including leukocytosis, possible pulmonary embolism, aspiration event, mental status changes, metabolic alkalosis, hyponatremia, pleural effusion, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The patient is on several medications, including antibiotics, anticoagulants, antiarrhythmics, and psychiatric medications. She has been placed on non-respiratory support with a non-rebreather mask due to hypoxia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels indicate impaired gas exchange, which can lead to tissue hypoxia and organ dysfunction if not corrected promptly.
2. Pneumonia: The presence of right lower lobe infiltrates suggests a possible lung infection, which may require adjustment in antibiotic therapy and supportive care measures.
3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Given the patient's immobilization and risk factors, there is a concern for PE. Empirical treatment for PE has been initiated, but further diagnostic evaluation may be necessary.
4. Aspiration: The patient's inability to protect her airway increases the risk of recurrent aspiration events, which can lead to ventilator-associated pneumonia or other complications.
5. Mental Status Changes"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 86-year-old female with a history of schizophrenia, left lower lobe pneumonia, chest tube placement, and likely pulmonary embolism. The patient is experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure and has been treated empirically for a possible pulmonary embolism. The patient's condition has progressively worsened, including respiratory failure and poor mental status.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, which indicates inadequate oxygenation of the blood. If not promptly addressed, this can lead to further respiratory distress and potential organ damage.

2. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's presentation suggests a likely pulmonary embolism, and she has been receiving anticoagulation treatment. However, there is still a risk of complications associated with PE, such as recurrent embolization or development of pulmonary hypertension.

3. Chest Infection: The presence of left lower lobe pneumonia and chest tube placement increases the risk of developing a secondary chest infection. Inadequate control of this infection can lead to worsening respiratory status and systemic complications.

4. Delirium: The patient's poor mental status indicates the possibility of delirium, which is common in critically ill patients. Delirium can complicate the clinical picture and increase the risk of falls, functional decline, and prolonged ICU stay.

5. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been"

 HIGH RISK FOR FALL
 HYPOXEMIA
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB)
   86F with afib, here with L pna and pleural effusion, s/p chest tube,
   now with hypoxia, respoiratory failure, empiric treatment for PE,
   progressively worsening resporatory failure and poor mental status:
   RESP FAILURE / PNA / HYPOXIA: also concern for pe; has shunt
   -completed course of abx
   -cont anticoagulation
   -cont supplemental O2
   LEUKOCYTOSIS: concern for c.diff
   -recheck c.diff
   -empiric flagyl
   POOR MENTAL STATUS:
   -no invasive work-up because of goal of care
   -considering head ct since on anticoagulation but unlikely to change
   management so will hold off
   GOALS OF CARE: discussed in detail with HCT yesterday;
   -continue supportive care until monday without escalation of care (no
   invasive, no pressors, etc.) until nephew can visit in 2 days
   -morphine if appears uncomfortable
   -dnr/dni

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is an 86-year-old female with schizophrenia, likely pulmonary embolism (PE), hypoxic respiratory failure, and chronic pleural effusion. She has a history of chest tube placement. Her current condition includes atrial fibrillation, fever of unknown origin, high risk for falls, hypoxemia, and poor mental status.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), heart rate of 88 bpm with AFib rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 100/40 mmHg to 53/34 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient's fluid balance indicates an intake of 4,037 mL, output of 1,790 mL, and a positive balance of 2,247 mL.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 10.7 to 24.9 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 9.8 g/dL and 30.8 %, platelet count between 362 and 400 K/uL, creatinine levels between 0.5 and 0.7 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 109 and 138 mg/dL, and sodium levels ranging from 105 to 137 mEq/L.

The patient's imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable. The assessment and plan include hyponatremia, pleural effusion, fever of"
