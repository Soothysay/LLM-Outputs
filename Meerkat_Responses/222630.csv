   presents with abdominal pain and headache consistent with her usual
   hypertensive urgency and was found to be in hypertensive urgency in
   ED.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 253/170 in ED. No
   significant improvement to 10 IV hydral and max dose of labetolol drip
   per ED signout.  Currently on nicardipine drip.  Patient has known
   malignant hypertension of unclear etiology.  Has known ESRD/HD due to
   SLE.  Patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday.  History and exam not
   consistent with infection or ischemia.  Likely has an anxiety component
   precipitating hypertension.
   - will cont nicardipine gtt for BP goal of < 180/100
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - nephrology consulted
 HD on Tuesday, cont BP meds, unlikely that pt
   is fluid overloaded
   - aliskiren dose verified
   - BCx with no growth as of [**12-19**]
   - will send for UA/Cx
 epi
s with bacteria, neg WBC, LE and Nitr
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing. Pt had recent CT
   scan which did not show source of abdominal pain.  Lipase near recent
   baseline of low 70s.
   - transplant surgery to remove PD cath Thrusday [**12-21**]
   - cont PO dilaudid prn home dose
   - pt states abd pain at baseline [**12-19**]
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule. Pt currently undergoing HD
   however still has PD line.
   - dialyzed [**12-19**]
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Her coumadin was held during last
   admission for supratherapeutic INR. Admitted on subtherpeutic INR of
   1.2
   - heparin gtt
   - started Coumadin 2mg PO qday
 d/c
d [**12-19**] in prep for OR Thursday,
   will stop heparin drip midnight before OR Thursday

   psychiatrist who started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - continue home lorazepam and clonazepam
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline. Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), malignant hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea. She presents with abdominal pain, headache, and is found to be in hypertensive urgency in the emergency department. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of her medical conditions.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current health status include:

1. Hypertensive urgency/ crisis: The patient's high blood pressure readings indicate a risk of hypertensive urgency or crisis. If not managed properly, it can lead to severe complications such as intracranial hemorrhage, heart attack, heart failure, or kidney damage.

2. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic kidney disease, which may further progress if not adequately managed. This could lead to worsening renal function, electrolyte imbalances, fluid overload, and increased risk of infections.

3. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs and systems. Flares or worsening of SLE activity can occur, leading to organ damage and dysfunction.

4. Malignant hypertension: The patient's history of malignant hypertension suggests a severe form of high blood pressure that can rapidly lead to organ damage, particularly the heart, brain, and kidneys.

5. Anxiety: The patient's anxiety may"

The patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, and malignant hypertension. She presented with abdominal pain and headache, which were consistent with her usual hypertensive urgency. The patient's blood pressure upon arrival was 253/170 mmHg, and she did not show significant improvement with previous medications. Currently, she is on a nicardipine drip to control her blood pressure.

The patient has known malignant hypertension of unclear etiology, along with ESRD/HD due to SLE. She underwent hemodialysis yesterday and has a scheduled transplant surgery to remove her peritoneal dialysis catheter on Thursday. Her extensive workup for abdominal pain has been unrevealing, with a recent CT scan showing no source of pain. Her lipase levels are near baseline.

The patient has a history of superior vena cava/brachiocephalic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is currently on heparin and Coumadin. Her INR was subtherapeutic at 1.2, but it has been increased. She also has anxiety, anemia, pericardial effusion, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), and is following a renal diet. She is on multiple medications including prednisone, labetalol, hydralazine, nif"

   Assessment and Plan
   24 year old lady with SLE, ESRD on HD and malignant hypertension
   presents with abdominal pain and headache consistent with her usual
   hypertensive urgency and was found to be in hypertensive urgency in
   ED.
   .
   1. Hypertensive Urgency: BP elevated on arrival to 253/170 in ED. No
   significant improvement to 10 IV hydral and max dose of labetolol drip
   per ED signout.  Currently on nicardipine drip.  Patient has known
   malignant hypertension of unclear etiology.  Has known ESRD/HD due to
   SLE.  Patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday.  Hisory and exam not
   consistent with infection or ischemia.  Likely has an anxiety component
   precipitating hypertension.
   - will cont nicardipine gtt for BP goal of < 180/100
   - continue PO Labetolol 400mg TID, Hydralazine 100mg PO q8H, Nifedipine
   90mg PO qday, Clonidine
   - will consult nephrology in AM
   - verify aliskiren with nephrology team in AM
   - follow up BCx sent from ED
   - will send for UA/Cx
   .
   2. Abdominal Pain: Extensive prior workup unrevealing. Pt had recent CT
   scan which did not show source of abdominal pain.  Lipase near recent
   baseline of low 70s.
   - transplant surgery was suppose to remove the PD line on Thursday
   - cont PO dilaudid prn home dose
   .
   3. ESRD: HD yesterday. On T/Th/Sat schedule. Pt currently undergoing HD
   however still has PD line.
   - consult renal team in AM
   .
   4. Hx of SVC/brachiocephalic DVT: Her coumadin was held during last
   admission for supratherapeutic INR. Admitted on subtherpeutic INR of
   1.2
   - consider heparin gtt bridge to therapeutic INR if her BP normalizes
   - will start Coumadin 2mg PO qday
   .
   5. Anxiety: Likely contributing to medical problems.  Pt recently saw
   psychiatrist who started her on Celexa.
   - continue Celexa 20mg PO qday
   - continue home lorazepam and clonazepam
   .
   6. Anemia: currently at baseline. Likely related to ESRD.
   - continue to monitor
   .
   7. SLE:
   - continue Prednisone 4mg PO qday
   .
   8. Pericardial effusion:
   - noted in TTE in the past.
   .
   9. HOCM:
   - will need to careful not to reduce too much after load
   - will attemp to rate control

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 24-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis (HD), and malignant hypertension. She presented with abdominal pain and headache, which are consistent with her usual hypertensive urgency. The patient underwent hemodialysis yesterday and has known malignant hypertension of unclear etiology.

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are as follows:

1. Hypertensive Urgency: The patient's blood pressure is elevated, and she is currently on nicardipine drip for blood pressure control. If not managed appropriately, it could lead to further complications such as hypertensive encephalopathy, hypertensive heart failure, or hypertensive retinopathy.

2. Abdominal Pain: The cause of the abdominal pain remains unclear despite extensive workup, including a recent CT scan that did not reveal any source. If the underlying cause is not identified and addressed, the abdominal pain could persist or worsen, potentially leading to further complications.

3. ESRD: The patient is on a thrice-weekly hemodialysis schedule. If the dialysis sessions are not conducted appropriately, it could result in inadequate removal of waste products and fluid buildup, leading to further deterioration of renal function and potential complications.

4. Heparin-induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT): The patient has a history of SVC/"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with hypertensive urgency and has a history of chronic anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic renal failure, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), nausea/vomiting, pain control, and abdominal pain. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being managed for their conditions.

24-hour events include an ultrasound and the placement of a dialysis catheter. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure reading of 132/65 mmHg. The patient is on several medications, including heparin sodium, and has a percutaneous dialysis catheter in place.

The physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished and not in acute distress. There are some notable findings, such as enucleated eyes, a systolic murmur, absent radial and distal pulses on the right side, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds, soft abdomen with a PD catheter, and warm skin.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, as well as elevated creatinine and blood glucose levels. Other labs indicate abnormalities in electrolytes, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate levels.

Assessment and plan include managing hypertension, addressing chronic anemia, SLE, chronic renal failure, OSA, nausea/vomiting, pain control, and abdominal pain. The plan involves adjusting medication dosages to avoid overdose, removal of the PD catheter"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presented with facial swelling and underwent dialysis catheter insertion. They also had an MRI of the head and neck, which showed no signs of new obstruction. The patient was not receiving food and expressed a desire to leave against medical advice (AMA). They were given Ativan for MRV and became sleepy but was breathing comfortably afterwards. The patient's history revealed allergies to penicillins, rash from Percocet, and itching. They were on various medications including heparin sodium, nitroglycerin, naloxone, furosemide, and hydralazine. Review of systems remained unchanged except for respiratory symptoms. The patient's vital signs showed high blood pressure and normal heart rate. Hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, and respiratory support were provided. The patient's physical examination showed well-nourished appearance, diminished pulses in extremities, tender abdomen, and warm skin. Neurologic examination was normal.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway obstruction: The patient had an initial complaint of facial swelling and underwent an MRI, which could indicate a potential airway obstruction.
2. Hypertensive crisis/emergency: The patient's blood pressure readings are consistently elevated, indicating a possible hypertensive crisis or emergency.
3. Chronic anemia: The patient's hemoglobin level is low, suggesting chronic anemia.

   # Somulence: Patient rousable and oriented. Likely med effect. ABG w/o
   hypercarbia
   - monitor closely
   - cont at decreased Dilaudid dose
   # Hypertension: initially 235/170 in ED, but improved with nicardipine
   drip which was discontinued during first unit stay. No clear
   precipitating event. No hx of recent drug use. On admit to the floor
   BPs are stable and the patient is aysmptomatic. Nephrology following.
   Plan to continue PO anti-hypertensives.
   - Consider restarting Aliskiren in consultation with renal
   -continue labetalol, hydralazine, nifedipine, clonidine at current
   doses. Have room to increase nifedipine if needed.
   -dialysis T, Thrs, Sat, plan for replacement of HD catheter on Thurs
   with temp line
   # SLE: Rheum following and does not suspect acute flare and dsDNA, C3,
   C4 nl, ESR and CRP slightly elevated. No evidence of blood or urine
   infection by culture that may have led to an acute flare. Pneumonia
   unlikely at this point as patient does not have fever or leukocytosis.
   Echo does not suggest worsening pericarditis.
   - restart prednisone at 4 mg PO daily
   #Abd pain: No clear etiology however previous workup is without
   significant findings, may be secondary to inflammation around the site
   of the PD catheter.
   -PD catheter to be removed on TODAY.
   -cont to treat pain
   #ESRD: HD today and scheduled for Thurs as well. Renal following.
   -follow lytes, replete as indicated
   - schedule NEW tunneled HD line, patient currently has temp
   # Anemia: baseline 26. AOCD and in setting of renal failure
   -monitor HCT
   #Coagulopathy: patient on lifetime anticoagulation for hx of multiple
   thrombotic events
   -hold warfarin now for replacement of dialysis catheter
   -heparin bridge
   -will restart warfarin for INR of [**2-12**] after replacement of HD cath.
   # HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on Echo. Currently not
   symptomatic. Echo without evidence of worsening pericardial effusion.
   -Continue bblocker
   # Depression/anxiety. Continue Celexa, hold clonazepam
   # OSA: CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis who presented with hypertensive urgency, headache, and abdominal pain. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for angioedema. Her facial swelling has resolved, and there is no evidence of acute superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient was given prednisone and started on dexamethasone due to concerns about angioedema. Dexamethasone has been stopped, and prednisone has been restarted at a dose of 4 mg per day.

The patient is currently on a heparin drip for a goal partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 60-80, and her blood pressure medications have been adjusted. She will continue with peritoneal dialysis catheter removal, scheduled for today, and will have hemodialysis sessions on Tuesday and Thursday. Renal follow-up is planned.

Other medical issues include suspected somnolence possibly due to medication effects, uncontrolled hypertension, SLE, abdominal pain without clear etiology, anemia, coagulopathy, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), depression/anxiety, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient will be monitored closely for any changes in condition."

   SVC is patent.
   Right subclavian vein and right brachiocephalic veins are patent. Right
   IJ not visualized in the neck, consistent with occlusion. Again seen is
   a large right external jugular vein which provides the major venous
   drainage of the neck.
   Left subclavian vein is patent and drains into numerous venous
   collaterals in the mediastinum due to left brachiocephalic vein
   occlusion. Left IJ is patent, but diminuitive.
   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo woman with hx of SLE, ERSD on HD who presented with hypertensive
   urgency, HA and abd pain now transferred to the unit for angioedema.
   # Facial Swelling/Angioedema: Resolved. Perhaps given patient
s known
   venous blockages in neck patient develops functional SVC with fluid
   overload. Can not r/o due to  Aliskiren. No evidence acute SVC syndrome
   by MRV. On admission to MICU got prednisone 60mg, then started on
   decadron out of concern for angio edema.  Patient
   - Stop decadron, restart prednisone 4mg which her home dose
   - Heparin drip for goal PTT 60-80
   - Stop benadryl and H2 blocker
   - D/C Nasal trumpet
   - CPAP for sleep
   # Somulence: Patient rousable and oriented. Likely med effect. ABG w/o
   hypercarbia. Avoid benadryl
   - monitor closely
   - cont at decreased Dilaudid dose
   # Hypertension: initially 235/170 in ED, but improved with nicardipine
   drip which was discontinued during first unit stay. No clear
   precipitating event. No hx of recent drug use. On admit to the floor
   BPs are stable and the patient is aysmptomatic. Nephrology following.
   Plan to continue PO anti-hypertensives.
   - Concerned about restarting Aliskiren
   - Increase nifedipine for better blood pressure control
   - D/C nitro drip if SBP <160
   -continue labetalol, hydralazine, clonidine at current doses.
   -dialysis T, Thrs, Sat, plan for replacement of HD catheter on Thurs
   with temp line
   # SLE: Rheum following and does not suspect acute flare and dsDNA, C3,
   C4 nl, ESR and CRP slightly elevated. No evidence of blood or urine
   infection by culture that may have led to an acute flare. Pneumonia
   unlikely at this point as patient does not have fever or leukocytosis.
   Echo does not suggest worsening pericarditis.
   - restart prednisone at 4 mg PO daily
   #Abd pain: No clear etiology however previous workup is without
   significant findings, may be secondary to inflammation around the site
   of the PD catheter.
   -PD catheter to be removed on TODAY.
   -cont to treat pain
   #ESRD: HD today and scheduled for Thurs as well. Renal following.
   -follow lytes, replete as indicated
   - schedule NEW tunneled HD line, patient currently has temp per renal
   -speak with renal about repeat dialysis today vs treating hyperkalemia
   with lasix
   # Anemia: baseline 26. AOCD and in setting of renal failure
   -monitor HCT
   #Coagulopathy: patient on lifetime anticoagulation for hx of multiple
   thrombotic events
   -hold warfarin now for replacement of dialysis catheter
   -restart heparin bridge
   -will restart warfarin for INR of [**2-12**] after replacement of HD cath.
   # HOCM: evidence of myocardial hypertrophy on Echo. Currently not
   symptomatic. Echo without evidence of worsening pericardial effusion.
   -Continue bblocker
   # Depression/anxiety. Continue Celexa, restart clonazepam  0.5mg [**Hospital1 **]
   # OSA: CPAP for sleep with 7 pressure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 24-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and multiple thrombotic events. She presented with hypertensive urgency, headache, and abdominal pain and was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for angioedema. The patient's facial swelling resolved after receiving prednisone. She has known venous blockages in her neck, which may have led to the development of a functional superior vena cava (SVC) with fluid overload. There is no evidence of acute SVC syndrome based on the magnetic resonance venography (MRV). The patient's blood pressure has improved with nicardipine, but concerns remain about restarting Aliskiren due to potential interactions with dialysis. Her abdominal pain may be secondary to inflammation around the site of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter, and the catheter will be removed today. The patient is scheduled for hemodialysis (HD) today and on Thursday. She also has anemia, coagulopathy, and a history of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), for which she is currently not symptomatic. The patient is being treated for depression/anxiety and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fluid overload due to functional SVC: The patient has evidence of fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema,"

   Facial Edema -
   Acute SVC syndrome now [**Doctor Last Name 6983**] likely. Ddx fluid overload vs agioedema,
   though no really likely meds. Now off decadron, benadryl and H2
   blocker. No decision on restarting renin inhibitor.
   Will restart heaprin drip now that PD catheter removed.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a chief complaint of facial swelling. They were admitted to the MICU with a differential diagnosis of angioedema versus superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. An MRV showed no evidence of new SVC clot, ruling out SVC syndrome. The patient is still in the ICU to establish hemodialysis (HD) access, as they have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and their temporary HD line was inadvertently pulled out.

The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins and is currently taking Percocet for pain, which causes itching. They have been receiving infusions of heparin sodium and nitroglycerin. Other medications include naloxone, furosemide, and hydralazine. The patient's medical and family history is unchanged from admission.

Review of systems is unchanged except for facial swelling. Vital signs show elevated blood pressure ranging from 178/117 mmHg to 220/139 mmHg. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 320 mL total, with 240 mL of intake through the PO and 80 mL through IVF. Output includes 2,550 mL of blood products and 1,550 mL of urine. Respiratory support is provided with CPAP mask, with SpO2 at 100%. ABG results are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals decreased facial edema, clear breath"
