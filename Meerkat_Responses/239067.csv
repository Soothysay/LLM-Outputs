","Summary:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of asthma and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by viral bronchitis. She has been diagnosed with several medical conditions including AFib with RVR (atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response), ARF (acute renal failure), hyperglycemia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and febrile neutropenia. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2 C (97.2 F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure of 162/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for minimal yellow sputum production and subjective improvement in air movement with bronchodilator nebs. The patient is currently receiving various medications including prednisone, bronchodilators, diltiazem, and others. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, BUN, glucose, and potassium, while other labs are within normal limits. The patient's physical examination reveals scattered end-expiratory wheezes and no acute distress.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's history of asthma and current symptoms suggest a potential exacerbation. Proper management with bronchodilators and corticosteroids is essential to"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of asthma and atrial fibrillation on coumadin, who presented with an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by viral bronchitis. She is currently in the ICU and has been receiving treatment for her asthma exacerbation, including prednisone and bronchodilators. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C (97.2°F), heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/60 mmHg to 162/105 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, symmetric chest expansion, clear breath sounds with scattered end-expiratory wheezes, and warm skin. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated blood glucose levels. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, and she has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic kidney disease. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's main issue in the ICU is an asthma exacerbation. It is important to closely monitor her respiratory status and adjust treatment accordingly.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and is currently experiencing this rhythm abnormality. Rate control measures are being implemented"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of asthma and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) who presented with an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by viral bronchitis. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 114 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 162/105 to 115/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. The patient is currently receiving prednisone for asthma exacerbation, bronchodilator nebs, and diltiazem for rate control. The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels, as well as slightly low potassium and magnesium levels. The patient's condition is stable, but there are concerns regarding atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. The patient has a supratherapeutic INR due to the use of coumadin, which may have been worsened by a dose of levofloxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib/RVR): The patient's elevated heart rate and irregular rhythm suggest ongoing AFib/RVR. This condition increases the risk of clot formation, which can lead to stroke or other embolic events if not appropriately managed.
2. Hypertension: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of asthma and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) presenting with an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by viral bronchitis. She is currently in the ICU and has several medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Asthma exacerbation: The patient's asthma symptoms have worsened, requiring treatment with prednisone, bronchodilators, and oxygen therapy.
2. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AF with RVR): The patient is experiencing irregular heart rhythm, which needs to be controlled with rate-limiting medications like sotalol and diltiazem.
3. Acute Kidney Injury (ARF): There are concerns about pre-renal azotemia due to diminished oral intake and the possibility of hypoperfusion. Fluid management and encouragement of oral intake are recommended.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated, especially while on steroids. Tight glycemic control should be maintained using insulin sliding scale (ISS).
5. Hypertension (HTN): The patient's high blood pressure needs to be managed by continuing her home regimen.
6. Hyperlipidemia: The patient has high cholesterol levels, and it is advised to continue her statin therapy.
7. Feeding and Nutrition: The patient's nutritional status should be monitored, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure adequate nutrition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is shortness of breath (SOB). The patient has been receiving symptomatic benefit from albuterol and is improving but still requires respiratory support through a nasal cannula with oxygen. 

The patient has a history of asthma, which seems to be exacerbated due to a viral illness. There are no signs of bacterial infection. The patient also has atrial fibrillation, controlled by sotalol, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and dyspnea. 

Vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 108 bpm, slightly low blood pressure ranging from 97/60 mmHg to 162/105 mmHg, normal respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's temperature is within normal range, but they have been experiencing tachypnea and wheezing. 

The patient's lab results indicate a slightly elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, and blood glucose level. Other lab values, such as potassium, sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels, are within normal limits. 

The patient's physical examination reveals well-nourished general appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, respiratory examination showing no wheezes, and diminished breath sounds on the left side. Neurological examination is also unremarkable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of asthma symptoms, development of pneumonia due to prolonged intubation, and"

","The patient is a 75-year-old female with a history of asthma and atrial fibrillation on coumadin. She presented with an asthma exacerbation likely triggered by viral bronchitis. The patient remains asymptomatic with better rate control after the initiation of diltiazem, but experiences hypotension even at 15 mg QID. The plan includes continuing sotalol, diltiazem 15 mg QID while holding dyazide, resuming coumadin at usual dose, and conducting a TTE to evaluate for RV dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. 

The patient's asthma exacerbation has resolved, and she received some medication teaching. A prednisone taper was prescribed, along with atrovent MDI q6 and albuterol MDI q4/prn. She may benefit from medication teaching and does not require antibiotics.

The patient has hypertension and will continue her home regimen, including diovan and holding dyazide since adding diltiazem. She also has hyperglycemia, which is high in the morning when she receives prednisone and breakfast. The plan is to refrain from adding long-acting insulin as the steroids are being tapered. The patient also has hyperlipidemia and will continue on a statin. She should follow a regular diet and replete potassium.

The patient's access is PIV, and she has been therapeutically anticoagulated with tolerating a diet. Her code status is full code,"
