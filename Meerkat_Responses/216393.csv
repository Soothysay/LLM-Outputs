","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and previous pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. The patient has an indwelling Port (PortaCath) and a 20-gauge catheter. He is receiving multiple antibiotics for suspected pneumonia, including vancomycin, cefepime, and azithromycin. His oxygen requirements remain very high, and he is on high-flow nasal cannula oxygen delivery. 

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 92 bpm with sinus rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 95/63 mmHg to 126/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows fluid balance with a total input of 1,526 mL and output of 1,087 mL since midnight. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, hematocrit of 33.1%, platelet count of 252 K/uL, creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 183 mg/dL, sodium level of 17 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.1 mEq/L, chloride level of 23 mg/dL, and magnesium level of 1.9 mg/dL. The patient's prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio are within normal range, as well as calcium, phosphate, and other electrolyte levels.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is diagnosed with pneumonia and will continue to receive antibiotics. Oxygen therapy will be weaned as tolerated. The patient's history of pulmonary embolism will continue to be managed with enoxaparin (lovenox) prophylaxis. The patient is nutritionally intact but will be kept NPO until evening. Glycemic control will be monitored due to the patient's diabetes mellitus. The patient's lines, including the indwelling Port and peripheral IV catheter, will be maintained. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers will also be continued."

","Summary:
The patient has been admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and other medical conditions. They have an indwelling port for medication administration and are receiving various treatments. The patient's vital signs are stable but show signs of respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation level of 89%. The patient's blood work indicates abnormalities in white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and electrolyte levels. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, anticoagulants, and anti-seizure medication.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's low oxygen saturation level indicates respiratory distress, which can lead to respiratory failure if not promptly addressed.
2. Sepsis: The presence of pneumonia and elevated white blood cell count suggests an ongoing infection, which could progress to sepsis if not treated effectively.
3. Bleeding: The prolonged PTT and low platelet count indicate a potential risk for bleeding complications, particularly considering the patient is on anticoagulant therapy.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The elevated creatinine level suggests impaired kidney function, which may require further evaluation and management.
5. Electrolyte Imbalance: Abnormalities in electrolyte levels, such as low sodium, potassium, and magnesium, may require correction to maintain proper bodily functions.
6. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): As the patient is immobilized in the ICU, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the deep"

","Summary:
The patient is a 74-year-old male with a medical history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and a history of pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU for respiratory distress and sepsis. The patient has been receiving antibiotics and is currently on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are as follows: temperature of 37.7°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 95/63 mmHg to 126/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 89%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for mild respiratory distress. Physical examination reveals crackles and bronchial breath sounds at the right base of the lungs. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 252 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL, and hyponatremia with a sodium level of 17 mEq/L. The patient's condition is complicated by pneumonia, and he continues to receive appropriate antibiotics. The plan is to wean off oxygen as tolerated. The patient's code status is DNR but agrees to intubation if needed. He remains in the ICU for further care and monitoring.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He is currently admitted to the ICU for shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is being treated empirically with vancomycin and cefepime for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). He is also on chronic low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The patient has a history of diabetes type II and requires insulin management. He has an altered mental status but is not delirious. The patient has declined to know details about his prognosis or future predictions regarding his disease. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's current diagnosis of pneumonia puts him at risk for worsening respiratory symptoms, such as increased shortness of breath and decreased oxygen saturation.
2. Hospital-acquired infections: As the patient is in the ICU, there is a risk of acquiring additional hospital-acquired infections, which could lead to sepsis and multi-organ failure.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is on chronic lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. However, if the lovenox is not effective or if the patient develops any signs of a blood clot, it could result in a DVT.
4. Pulmonary embolism (PE):"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 62-year-old man with esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis. The patient is on chronic prednisone, which makes him immunosuppressed. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on supplemental oxygen. The patient's general appearance is pleasant but shows signs of labored breathing.

Physical examination reveals regular heart rhythm with normal rate and no murmurs or rubs. Lung sounds are decreased in the right middle lobe with scattered rhonchi and crackles throughout. The abdomen is soft, non-tender, and without hepatosplenomegaly. No edema or calf pain is present, but dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, platelet count of 252 K/uL, creatinine of 1.1 mg/dL, and glucose of 183 mg/dL. Other labs indicate elevated PT and PTT, as well as normal calcium and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis. The most likely diagnosis at this point is bacterial pneumonia, and he is already on antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime) to cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia. The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism, but given his current presentation and chronic use of heparin, it is less likely to be the cause of his symptoms. The patient has diabetes type II, and his mental status is altered but not delirium. He has a DNR order but is willing to be intubated if necessary. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of pneumonia. The current treatment with vancomycin and cefepime is appropriate, but further evaluation with sputum culture and imaging may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific causative organism.

2. Pulmonary embolism: Although less likely given the patient's chronic use of heparin, the history of pulmonary embolism and the acute presentation with tachycardia, low-grade temperature, and hypoxia warrant consideration. Imaging studies such as a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) can help rule out a pulmonary embolism"

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presented with shortness of breath and fever, and was diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient also has diabetes type II, altered mental status, and a past medical history of PE. He is currently on chronic prednisone, dapsone prophylaxis, and Lovenox. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg, respiratory rate of 29 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on face tent. Physical examination reveals no abnormalities except for mild wheezing in the lungs. Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated glucose levels at 183 mg/dL, and abnormal coagulation parameters with PT/INR at 15.0/1.3, respectively. The patient is currently receiving supplemental oxygen, albuterol and atrovent nebs as needed, vancomycin, cefepime, and heparin gtt for now. Blood cultures are pending, and further diagnostic tests such as a CT angiogram to rule out PE and evaluate lung parenchyma are planned. The patient's code status is DNR but okay to intubate, and he"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and a previous pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia and bacteremia. He is currently on antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, tobramycin), and his vital signs are stable. The patient is receiving oxygen via face tent and has a SpO2 of 92%. His respiratory distress has improved since admission. He is also receiving enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis and pantoprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and elevated glucose levels. The patient's code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), but he is okay with intubation. He will remain in the ICU until his oxygen needs decrease to less than 50%.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring of his respiratory status and sputum cultures will be important to prevent and detect this complication.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Although the patient is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, there is still a risk of developing a clot, especially given his immobilization in the ICU. Regular assessment of his extremities for signs of swelling"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and a history of pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia and bacteremia. The patient is currently receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin) for his infection, and his oxygen therapy is being weaned as tolerated. He also continues to receive enoxaparin (lovenox) for prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he does show mild respiratory distress at rest. His physical examination reveals bronchial and crackles in the right lower lobe of his lungs. Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and glucose levels. Other lab results, including PT/PTT/INR, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and electrolytes, are within normal ranges.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The presence of pneumonia and bacteremia increases the risk of respiratory failure due to compromised lung function.
2. Sepsis: The ongoing infection and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential risk for sepsis, which can lead to organ dysfunction.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism: Although the patient is receiving enoxaparin for DVT prophylaxis, his history of PE puts him at a higher risk for developing another"

   This is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the
   lungs and brain who presents with shortness of breath and fever.
   .
   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Most likely represents pneumonia.
   Also on the differential would be progression of his metastatic lung
   disease, however the acute presentation with associated fever and
   leukocytosis would go against this.  Also, with underlying malignancy,
   tachycardia, low-grade temp, and hypoxia, as well as history of PE,
   cannot rule out PE here; however the patient is on chronic lovenox.
   - cont supplemental O2 as needed
   - albuterol and atrovent nebs prn
   - cont vancomycin, cefepime, tobramycin to cover empirically for HCAP
   - urinary legionella negative: d/c azithromycin
   - cont. outpatient regimen of lovenox
   .
   #  Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely source at this point is a bacterial
   pneumonia.  Other potenial sources include Portacath infection or UTI.
   GNR bacteremia in one blood cx from the ED.  Given immunosuppression on
   chronic prednisone need to also consider viral or fungal etiologies as
   well. PCP less likely given he is on dapsone prophylaxis.
   - tobramycin added to vanco and cefepime for double coverage against
   GNR such as pseudomonas
   -check tobramycin level tomorrow am
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC
   - tylenol prn fever
   - f/u blood culture: speciation and susceptibility of GNR
   - send UA, urine culture
   - send sputum culture if able
   .
   #  Esophageal cancer:
   - will touch base with his primary oncologist's office (though the
   oncologist is currently out of town) on Monday
   -cont. dapsone prophylaxis as patient is chronically immunosuppressed
   - cont prednisone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] for symptoms of mild adrenal insufficiency
   following Dexamethasone taper s/p total brain radiation

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. The patient has altered mental status, pneumonia, and possible pulmonary embolism (PE) on the differential. He is hypoxic and tachypneic with wheezing and rhonchi at the right lower lung bases. The patient has leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL and an elevated heart rate. His blood cultures show GNR bacteremia, and he is being treated with vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin for bacterial pneumonia. He is also on dapsone prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and chronic prednisone. The patient has diabetes type II and requires glycemic control. He is receiving full liquid nutrition and has indwelling lines for medication administration. The patient is on prophylactic lovenox for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and protonix for stress ulcer prevention. His code status is do not resuscitate (DNR), and he will be transferred to the floor when his respiratory status stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has signs and symptoms consistent with pneumonia, including fever, leukocytosis, and hypoxia. He is being treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, but"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis. He is currently in the ICU for pneumonia and other conditions. His vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 126/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen and a face tent. Physical examination findings include tachypnea, wheezing, rhonchi at the right lung bases, and normal neurologic status. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, elevated glucose levels, and abnormal kidney function. The patient is being treated with antibiotics for suspected bacterial pneumonia and has a PortaCath for medication administration. He also has a history of esophageal cancer, diabetes type II, and possible adrenal insufficiency. The patient's code status is DNR, and he is expected to be transferred to the floor when his respiratory status stabilizes.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Pneumonia: The patient already has pneumonia, which could progress and lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially sepsis if not effectively treated.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to immob"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and previous pulmonary embolism. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to pneumonia, hypoxemia, and bacteremia. The patient is receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin) for his infection, and efforts are being made to wean off oxygen as tolerated. Surveillance cultures and an echocardiogram are also planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of hypoxemia and the presence of pneumonia may increase the risk of respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygen levels and respiratory support will be necessary.

2. Sepsis: The patient's bacteremia indicates an ongoing infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis. Continued administration of appropriate antibiotics and close monitoring of vital signs are essential.

3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, and he is currently receiving prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) to prevent DVT. Regular assessment for signs of DVT and continuation of anticoagulation therapy are recommended.

4. Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis: Given the patient's critical condition and prolonged ICU stay, stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole (protonix) is indicated to prevent gastrointestinal bleeding.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of metastatic esophageal cancer, diabetes mellitus, and a previous pulmonary embolism. He was admitted to the ICU for pneumonia, hypoxemia, and bacteremia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and receiving antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, and tobramycin). His vital signs show tachycardia, hypertension, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's respiratory support includes a face tent with high-flow oxygen. Laboratory results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, hyperglycemia, and electrolyte imbalances. The assessment remains unchanged, with ongoing pneumonia and no signs of improvement. The plan includes continuing antibiotics, weaning oxygen as tolerated, performing nebulizations, monitoring surveillance cultures, considering an echocardiogram, and continuing low molecular weight heparin. The patient has a do not resuscitate (DNR) order with agreement for intubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potentially necessitate a change in antibiotic therapy.
2. Nosocomial infection: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of acquiring nosocomial infections, such as catheter"

","The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for further management. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.4°C (97.5°F), heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 116/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on high flow nasal cannula. 

Physical examination reveals scattered wheezes and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe, suggesting possible pneumonia. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no hepatic or splenic enlargement. There is no edema or calf pain, and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are 2+. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a WBC count of 17.1 K/uL, elevated CRP of 36.5 mg/dL, and decreased hemoglobin of 11.4 g/dL. Blood cultures have grown a Gram-negative rod bacteremia that is pansensitive. 

The patient's current medications include vancomycin, cefepime, pantoprazole, and enoxaparin. He has received a total of 2,500 mL of fluids since midnight and has had 2,500 mL of output through urine and NG"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the
   lungs and brain who presents with shortness of breath and fever.
   .
   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Etiologies include V/Q mismatch or
   shunt.  Most likely represents pneumonia, but also need to consider
   metastatic lung disease/ postobstructive pneumonia, PE (hx of PE and
   malignancy although patient is on lovenox), intracardiac shunt.
   Respiratory status has not significantly improved and CXR shows
   worsening infiltrate on RLL which may partially be atelectatic and
   vascular congestion.
   - cont supplemental O2 as needed, wean FI02 as possible
   - continue spirometry
   - albuterol and atrovent nebs prn
   - gentle diuresis with goal of -500 cc fluid balance
   - cont vancomycin (day 4) and cefepime (day 3) to cover empirically for
   HCAP
   - d/c tobramycin as GNR from initial blood culture is pan-susceptible
   -TTE with bubble study to evaluate for intracardiac shunt as etiology
   of hypoxia
   - cont. outpatient regimen of lovenox
   .
   #  Fever/Leukocytosis:  Most likely source at this point is a bacterial
   pneumonia.  Other potenial sources include Portacath infection or UTI.
   GNR bacteremia
 pansensitive - in one blood cx from the ED.  Given
   immunosuppression on chronic prednisone need to also consider viral or
   fungal etiologies as well. PCP less likely given he is on dapsone
   prophylaxis.
   - cont to monitor fever curve and WBC
   - tylenol prn fever
   - d/c tobramycin in light of recent sensitivity data of GNR seen in
   blood cx (no need for double coverage against pseudomonas)
   - sputum cx not adequate
   .
   #  Esophageal cancer:
   - will touch base with his primary oncologist's office (though the
   oncologist is currently out of town) on Monday
   -cont. dapsone prophylaxis as patient is chronically immunosuppressed
   - cont prednisone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] for symptoms of mild adrenal insufficiency

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. The patient is currently in the ICU and is receiving supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, and other supportive treatments. His vital signs are stable, but he has scattered wheezes and decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe (RLL). The patient's mental status is altered, but not delirious. His lab results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine, and glucose levels. He has a history of type II diabetes, esophageal cancer, and brain metastasis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and worsening infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest pneumonia. This condition can worsen the patient's respiratory status and may require more aggressive treatment.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's immobility and malignancy, there is an increased risk of developing blood clots in the legs. This could lead to a potentially life-threatening condition if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism.
3. Esophageal Cancer Progression: The patient's underlying esophageal cancer may continue to progress, leading to further complications such as obstruction or bleeding.
4. Brain Metastasis: The patient's brain metastasis could lead to"

 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the
   lungs and brain who presents with shortness of breath and fever.
   .
   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Most likely represents pneumonia.
   Also on the differential would be progression of his metastatic lung
   disease, however the acute presentation with associated fever and
   leukocytosis would go against this, although a post-obstructive
   pneumonia is certainly a possibility.  Also, with underlying
   malignancy, tachycardia, low-grade temp, and hypoxia, as well as
   history of PE, cannot rule out PE here; however the patient is on
   chronic lovenox.

   pneumonia.  Other potenial sources include Portacath infection or UTI.
   GNR bacteremia in one blood cx from the ED.  Given immunosuppression on
   chronic prednisone need to also consider viral or fungal etiologies as
   well. PCP less likely given he is on dapsone prophylaxis.
   - tobramycin added to vanco and cefepime for double coverage against
   GNR such as pseudomonas

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the information given are:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and leukocytosis suggest the possibility of pneumonia. It is likely due to a bacterial infection, and the current treatment includes antibiotics (vancomycin, cefepime, tobramycin) to cover for hospital-acquired or community-acquired pneumonia.

2. Pulmonary embolism (PE): Although less likely compared to pneumonia, the patient's tachycardia, low-grade temperature, hypoxia, and history of PE make it a potential complication. However, since the patient is already on chronic Lovenox (enoxaparin), the risk of PE may be reduced.

3. Portacath infection: The patient has an indwelling PortaCath, which increases the risk of infection. Monitoring for signs of infection and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued.

4. Urinary tract infection (UTI): Given the presence of leukocytosis and fever, a UTI should also be considered as a potential source of infection. Further evaluation with urinalysis and urine culture is recommended.

5. Esophageal cancer progression: Although not directly indicated by the current symptoms, the patient"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath, fever, and altered mental status. The patient's respiratory status has not significantly improved, and a chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe (RLL), which may be partially atelectatic and vascular congestion. The patient is currently on supplemental oxygen and receiving treatment for pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fever, and worsening infiltrate on the chest X-ray suggest the presence of pneumonia. This condition can lead to further respiratory distress and potentially progress to sepsis if not appropriately treated.

2. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Given the patient's respiratory symptoms and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on the chest X-ray, there is a possibility of developing ARDS. ARDS is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe inflammation and fluid buildup in the lungs.

3. Sepsis: The patient's fever, leukocytosis, and positive blood culture for GNR bacteremia indicate an infection. If the infection spreads systemically, it can lead to sepsis, which is a potentially fatal condition.

4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient's immobilization due to being in the ICU and his"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. 

The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently in the ICU for further management. His respiratory status has not significantly improved despite receiving supplemental oxygen, and a worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe (RLL) is observed on the chest X-ray, which may be partially atelectatic and due to vascular congestion. 

The patient's fever and leukocytosis suggest a bacterial pneumonia as the likely source, with potential sources including a Portacath infection or urinary tract infection (UTI). However, given the patient's immunosuppression from chronic prednisone use, viral or fungal etiologies should also be considered. 

The patient is on outpatient prophylaxis with dapsone for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and is currently being treated with vancomycin and cefepime empirically for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP). Tobramycin has been discontinued due to the sensitivity data of the Gram-negative rod (GNR) bacteremia seen in the blood culture. 

Further assessments and plans include monitoring the fever curve and white blood cell count, performing a bedside ultrasound to assess for pleural effusion, continuing low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presented with shortness of breath and fever. The patient's respiratory status has not significantly improved, and his chest X-ray shows worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe (RLL), which may be partially atelectatic and vascular congestion.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms and chest X-ray findings suggest pneumonia, possibly due to metastatic lung disease or postobstructive pneumonia. The patient is already receiving appropriate antibiotics, and respiratory support is being provided as needed.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to malignancy and immobilization. Bilateral Lower Extremity Venous Ultrasonography (LENI) has been ordered to evaluate for DVTs.

3. Pulmonary Embolism (PE): Although the patient's risk for PE is low, it should still be considered given his history of PE and malignancy. He is currently receiving prophylactic enoxaparin (lovenox) for DVT.

4. Metastatic Lung Disease: The patient's underlying esophageal cancer has metastasized to the lungs, which could contribute to his respiratory symptoms.

5. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient is on prednisone for symptoms of mild adrenal insufficiency following"

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He is currently admitted to the ICU due to shortness of breath and fever.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 87 bpm, blood pressure of 109/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 90% on high-flow nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm, and his general appearance is pleasant and alert.

Physical examination reveals decreased lung sounds in the right lower lobe, egophony over the right lung fields, and inspiratory wheezes. There is no evidence of edema or calf pain, and the patient has dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses present.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL, slightly elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, and normal platelet count. The patient's blood cultures have been negative except for a pan-sensitive Gram-negative bacterial infection detected on August 16th. Other laboratory values such as sodium, potassium, glucose, and liver function tests are within normal limits.

Radiology findings include worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe of the lungs, which may be partially atelectatic and show signs of vascular congestion.

   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  O2 requirement at 80% Facemask +6L by
   NC, but reduced to 50%  +6L NC this morning. Unclear whether
   improvement is temporary or possible recovery. Etiologies include V/Q
   mismatch or shunt.  Most likely represents pneumonia, but also need to
   consider metastatic lung disease/ postobstructive pneumonia, PE (hx of
   PE and malignancy although patient is on lovenox), intracardiac
   shunt.    Respiratory status has not significantly improved and CXR
   shows worsening infiltrate on RLL which may partially be atelectatic
   and vascular congestion. Tobramycin discontinued, GNR pansensitive. TTE
   no PFO or cardiac shunt. LENI

   - cont supplemental O2 as needed, wean FI02 as possible
   - continue spirometry
   - albuterol and atrovent nebs prn
   - continue lasix  10 mg [**Hospital1 **] to gently diurese. Monitor creatinine for
   elevation.
   - Last day Vancomycin today (day 8), continue cefepime (day 7) for 14
   days total for GNR positive blood cx.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of esophageal cancer metastatic to the lungs and brain. He presents with shortness of breath and fever. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98°F), heart rate of 91 bpm (normal range 76-114 bpm), blood pressure of 108/78 mmHg (normal range 83-123/97 mmHg), respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute (normal range 14-34 breaths per minute), and oxygen saturation of 91% on high flow nasal cannula.

The patient has decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe (RLL) with egophony and inspiratory wheezes. This suggests a possible pneumonia, especially considering the worsening infiltrate seen on chest X-ray. Other potential etiologies for his shortness of breath and hypoxia include V/Q mismatch or shunt, postobstructive pneumonia, pulmonary embolism (PE), or intracardiac shunt.

The patient has a leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL (normal range 11.0-8.2 K/uL), which has resolved from a previous high of 310 K/uL. This suggests a bacterial infection, possibly pneumonia. The patient was"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old man with esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain. He presented with shortness of breath and fever. The patient is currently in the ICU, where he has been receiving various treatments and interventions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is likely due to his weakened immune system from chemotherapy and the presence of a PortaCath. The worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe of the lungs suggests a bacterial infection. Antibiotics have been initiated, but the respiratory status has not significantly improved. Further monitoring and treatment are necessary.

2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at high risk for DVT due to malignancy, immobility, and central venous catheters. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) have been started, but there is a concern for possible pulmonary embolism (PE). Further assessment and monitoring for DVT and PE are needed.

3. Diabetes Type II: The patient has a history of diabetes type II, and his glycemic control needs to be addressed. A sliding scale insulin regimen should be implemented to manage blood glucose levels, and long-acting insulin may be considered if necessary.

4. Adrenal Insufficiency: The patient has been on chronic prednisone for symptoms of mild adrenal insufficiency following total brain radiation."

","Summary of Progress Note:

- The patient is a 62-year-old male with esophageal cancer that has metastasized to the lungs and brain.
- He presents with shortness of breath, fever, and was found to have pneumonia.
- His respiratory status has not significantly improved, and there is a worsening infiltrate on the right lower lobe of the lungs.
- The patient has been receiving supplemental oxygen, nebulizers with albuterol and atrovent as needed, and diuretics to manage fluid buildup.
- He has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and is on lovenox for prophylaxis.
- The patient's fever and leukocytosis have resolved, but he still requires antibiotics for his GNR positive blood culture.
- His diabetes type II will need to be managed with insulin.
- The patient is on chronic prednisone for immunosuppression and is also on dapsone prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP).
- There is a concern for adrenal insufficiency following total brain radiation, so the patient is on prednisone.
- The patient has an indwelling PortaCath for medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen requirements are high, indicating severe low oxygen levels in the blood. This could be due to pneumonia, V/Q mismatch, shunt, or metastatic lung disease.

2. Pneumonia"

 HYPOXEMIA
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the
   lungs and brain who presents with shortness of breath and fever. He has
   been requiring 50-80% oxygen by face mask + 6L O2 NC, with some signs
   of improvement over the last 24 hours.

   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Pt on 50% by face mask + 6L O2 NC this
   morning, in no distress.  Pt has had multiple discussions with social
   work/palliative care.  He inquired about transfer to floor this morning
   and then home for palliative/hospice care. Creatinine increased from
   1.1 to 1.2.  Unclear whether improvement is temporary or possible
   recovery. Etiologies include V/Q mismatch or shunt.  Most likely
   represents pneumonia, but also need to consider metastatic lung
   disease/ postobstructive pneumonia, PE (hx of PE and malignancy

   - Continue cefepime (day 9) for 14 days total for GNR positive blood
   cx. Vancomycin decreased.
   - cont. outpatient regimen of lovenox
   - discuss plan with palliative care/social work to get pt to floor and
   then home with high flow oxygen if possible.  Try to transfer to OMED
   due to many cancer related issues.
   - reevaluate CT Chest to evaluate for possible palliative intervention
   such as stent, however unlikely pt a candidate

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.3°F), heart rate of 99 bpm (94-110), blood pressure of 111/81 mmHg (85-131/53-86), respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute (17-29), and oxygen saturation of 89%. 

Physical examination findings show decreased breath sounds in the right lower lobe (RLL) and right upper lobe (RUL), with more breath sounds in the RLL compared to yesterday. There is also inspiratory wheezing more prominent on the right side. 

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 17.1 K/uL (8.9), elevated creatinine levels from 1.1 to 1.2, and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 248 IU/L. Blood cultures are negative for GNR bacteria. 

The patient's chest X-ray reveals consolidation/infiltrate in the RLL, as well as a right-sided effusion. The CXR also shows a decrease in"

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOXEMIA
 PNEUMONIA, OTHER
   This is a 62 year-old man with esophageal cancer metastatic to the
   lungs and brain who presents with shortness of breath and fever. He has
   been requiring 50-80% oxygen by face mask + 6L O2 NC, with some signs
   of improvement over the last 24 hours.
   .
   #  Shortness of breath/Hypoxia:  Pt on 50% by face mask + 6L O2 NC this
   morning, in no distress.  Pt has had multiple discussions with social
   work/palliative care.  He inquired about transfer to floor. Creatinine
   increased from 1.1 to 1.2.  Unclear whether improvement is temporary or
   possible recovery. Etiologies include V/Q mismatch or shunt.  Most
   likely represents pneumonia, but also need to consider metastatic lung
   disease/ postobstructive pneumonia, PE (hx of PE and malignancy
   although patient is on lovenox), intracardiac shunt.    Respiratory
   status has not significantly improved and CXR shows worsening
   infiltrate on RLL which may partially be atelectatic and vascular
   congestion. Tobramycin discontinued, GNR pansensitive. TTE no PFO or
   cardiac shunt. LENI
s negative.
   - cont supplemental O2 as needed, wean FI02 as possible
   - continue spirometry
   - albuterol and atrovent nebs prn
   - continue lasix 10 mg [**Hospital1 **] for diuresis
monitor creatinine as starting
   to increase.
   - Continue cefepime (day 8) for 14 days total for GNR positive blood
   cx. Vancomycin decreased.
   - cont. outpatient regimen of lovenox
   #  Fever/Leukocytosis:  Resolved.  After fever in [**Name (NI) **], pt afebrile for
   entire LOS in ICU, now day 6.  Leukocytosis has resolved (17.1
8.9)
   Most likely cause is bacterial pneumonia.  Other potenial sources
   include Portacath.  No evidence for UTI.  GNR bacteremia
 pansensitive
   - in one blood cx from the ED.  Given immunosuppression on chronic
   prednisone need to also consider viral or fungal etiologies as well.
   PCP less likely given he is on dapsone prophylaxis.
   - Continue Cefepime for one week.
   - monitor for fever and WBC
   - tylenol prn fever
   #  Esophageal cancer:
   - primary oncologist at family mtg yesterday, will email him with any
   updates.
   - cont. dapsone prophylaxis as patient is chronically immunosuppressed;
   check ABG to see if patient has significant methehemoglobinemia
   contributing to hypoxia
   - cont prednisone 10mg [**Hospital1 **] for symptoms of mild adrenal insufficiency
   following Dexamethasone taper s/p total brain radiation as per patient,
   as per neuro-oncologist
s note prednisone was started [**3-19**] concern for
   postradiation lung fibrosis
   #  Diabetes Type II:
   - will cover with humalog sliding scale
   - assess insulin requirements and consider long-acting if needed
