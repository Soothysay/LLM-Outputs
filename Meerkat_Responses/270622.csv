   CXR [**8-28**]: compared to [**8-27**], further re-expansion of R lung with small
   apical Pneumothorax. Large mass with volume loss in RUL persists. L
   lung clear.
   .
   CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis (FINAL):
   1. Vascular findings unchanged from [**2172-8-25**]. Narrowing of SVC and left
   brachiocephalic vein by large mediastinal mass. The SVC is narrowed to
   approximately 5 mm over a region extending 3 cm in craniocaudal
   dimension.
   Indirect evidence of right brachiocephalic vein occlusion, likely
   complete.
   Unchanged narrowing of right pulmonary artery. Splayed but patent
   aortic arch
   branches.
   2. Interval decrease in large right pleural effusion, with small
   anterior
   pneumothorax. Right chest tube terminating at apex.
   3. No interval change in large infiltrative hypoattenuating right
   hilar/mediastinal mass.
   4. No evidence of metastases in the abdomen or pelvis. Slightly bulky
   left
   adrenal gland without discrete nodule or mass.
   5. Anasarca and small amount of peritoneal fluid collecting in the
   pelvis,
   likely related to edema.
   6. Interval tracheal stenting with improved caliber of airway.
   .
   Pathology: The tumor shows areas of necrosis and extensive apoptosis;
   some areas  the tumor cell size approaching that of a small cell
   carcinoma, but much of the tumor has larger nuclei.  Overall, the tumor
   probably fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung.

   .
   58F with concern for small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pleural effusion, pericardial
   effusion, Pneumothorax, hyponatremia admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxemia respiratory failure:  Several reasons for this, including
   right upper and lower lobe collapse, right pleural effusion, right
   pneumothorax. s/p bronchoscopy [**2172-8-26**]; no significant secretions or
   mucus plugs seen on bronchoscopy. Most likely with VQ mismatch because
   of compression of pulmonary vasculature. RLL collapse has improved with
   chest tube but with persistent RUL collapse and small apical
   Pneumothroax. Most recent ABG (10PM) with metabolic acidosis, pO2 99.
   - Pressure support, 14/5 FiO2 50%
   - Sedation with propofol
   - Chest tube, pigtail catheter to allow for parenchymal reexpansion
   tube with low output. Will discuss with IP about whether to remove or
   keep in place given if this is malignant pleural effusion, if effusion
   will recur vs tube as nidus of infection.
   - Tumor decompression therapy to allow for improved ventilation (airway
   compression) and perfusion (vasculature compression)
   .
   #. Suspected small cell lung carcinoma:  Per report. Biopsy results not
   available in OMR. Given associated SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely
   poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis negative for metastases.
   - Radiation therapy, as above
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   -CT Head to evaluate for mets
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC.
   - Radiation therapy for decompression now that we have a diagnosis, as
   above
   - Appreciate vascular surgery recs
 currently: no stent, discuss code
   status
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**]. LDH
   effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria). Slightly elevated
   effusion protein. Normal glucose. Consistent with exudative effusion.
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion. Bacterial infection unlikely
   given lymphocyte predominance. Given lymphocyte predominance, may also
   consider TB as we do not know pt
s social or travel history.
   - Pigtail catheter
 d/w IP re continued need, as above
   - Await fluid cytology and cultures
   -Possible PPD placement
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  s/p chest tube placement. Unclear if this
   precipitated respiratory distress or rather was secondary to
   overinflation during resuscitation period. Risk factor with significant
   smoking history would be blebs.
   - Right chest tube in place
   - Thoracic surgery recs
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage.
   - Monitor pulsus paradoxus
   - Cardiology recs
   - Check EKG this AM
   .
   #. Hyponatremia:  Differential includes SIADH given lung cancer,
   adrenal insufficiency given recent hyperkalemia and hypotension,
   decreased renal perfusion. Patient reportedly improved with fluid
   restriction, consistent with SIADH, although UNa <10 not consistent
   with this diagnosis. Suspect mixed picture where patient also has
   decreased perfusion of kidneys secondary to SVC obstruction.
   - f/u urine lytes and osms
   - Continue exogenous steroid therapy
   - Continue fluid restriction
   .
   #. Hypotension:  Approximately 24 hours prior to transfer to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**].
   Suspected initially to be secondary to adrenal insufficiency given
   hyperkalemia, acidosis. No evidence of adrenal hemorrhage, mass on CT
   abd/pelvis, although L adrenal slightly bulky. Differential also
   includes tension pneumothorax with improvement secondary to chest tube
   placement. Cardiac tamponade unlikely given absence of tamponade
   physiology on TTE. Septic shock possible given episode of hypothermia.
   - Continue hydrocortisone 100mg IV Q8 hours
   - Management of pericardial and pleural effusions, as above
   - Endocrine recs
   - F/u AM Cortisol
   - Monitor blood, urine cultures. Will reculture for hypothermia, fever.
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Nongap. No reported GI losses. Suspect
   dilutional secondary to fluid overload. Type IV RTA also possible
   despite normal creatinine; additionally, normal creatinine may be false
   reassurance for normal renal function given muscle wasting. Incomplete
   respiratory compensation on ventilator. [**Month (only) 11**] also be post-hypocapneic
   (Increased respiratory alkalosis, perhaps when tachypneic, with renal
   wasting of HCO3; Pt
s alkalosis may have been quickly corrected when
   put on vent with delayed correction of HCO3)
 however, pt
s HCO3 was
   nl at admission making this unlikely.
   - Urine lytes (Na, K, Cl)
   - Monitor ABG
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  No clear infection. Likely inflammatory response
   given malignancy, SVC syndrome. Of note, reportedly was hypothermic
   yesterday. If concern ofr infection, will panculture.
   - Monitor blood, thoracentesis cultures
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Most acute concern would be DIC; LDH elevated
   although bilirubin normal. ACD possible given malignancy.
   - Haptoglobin
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm.
   - Continue antiepileptics
   .
   #. Hypertension:
   - Holding metoprolol in context of recent hypotension

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of concern for small cell carcinoma of the lung, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and hyponatremia. She was admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia respiratory failure: The patient has several factors contributing to hypoxemia, including right upper and lower lobe collapse, right pleural effusion, and right pneumothorax. Pressure support, low tidal volume ventilation, and FiO2 adjustments are being made to optimize oxygenation.
2. SVC syndrome: The patient has incomplete occlusion of the SVC, leading to upper extremity and facial swelling. Radiation therapy for decompression is planned.
3. Pleural effusion: The patient has a malignant-appearing pleural effusion, which may require continued pigtail catheter placement and monitoring. Fluid cytology and cultures are pending.
4. Pneumothorax: The patient has a small apical pneumothorax. The right chest tube is in place, and the patient will be monitored for improvement in lung reexpansion.
5. Pericardial effusion: The patient has a suspected malignant pericardial effusion. Cardiology recommendations are being followed, and the patient's condition will be monitored.
6. Hyponatremia"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma (presumptive) and symptoms of superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. She was admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement. The patient has multiple medical complications including hypoxemia respiratory failure, hypotension, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia Respiratory Failure: The patient has right upper and lower lobe collapse, right pleural effusion, and a small apical pneumothorax, leading to V/Q mismatch and inadequate oxygenation. Pressure support and FiO2 adjustments are being made to improve ventilation and oxygenation.

2. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is responsive to fluid boluses and may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, tension pneumothorax, septic shock, or cardiac tamponade. Hydrocortisone therapy is continued as per endocrine recommendations.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's hyponatremia is improving and has a mixed etiology including SIADH, hypoaldosteronism, and decreased renal perfusion. Fluid restriction and exogenous steroid therapy are ongoing.

4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has non-gap metabolic acidosis, likely due to dilutional effects from"

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and a large right-sided mediastinal mass. The patient has been experiencing superior vena cava syndrome (SVC syndrome) with partial compression, airway compromise requiring a Y-stent, pleural effusion likely malignant, and respiratory failure requiring intubation twice.

The patient has been admitted to the hospital for decompression radiation therapy and is scheduled to start chemotherapy today. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.4°C (99.3°F), heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 135/72 mmHg to 94/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation.

The patient's physical examination reveals upper body edema, including the face, and difficulty with accommodation. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, and there are chest tubes in place. The abdomen is benign, and the extremities are warm. Neurological assessment is difficult due to the level of sedation.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and blood urea nitrogen. The patient also has hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Imaging studies reveal a right upper lobe collapse with a consistent appearance of the mass,"

   effusion, Pneumothorax, hyponatremia admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxemia respiratory failure:  Several reasons for this, including
   right upper lobe collpase due to tumor, right pleural effusion. Right
   pneumothorax appears to have resolved. S/p bronchoscopy [**2172-8-26**]; no
   significant secretions or mucus plugs seen on bronchoscopy. Most likely
   with VQ mismatch because of compression of pulmonary vasculature. With
   persistent RUL collapse. Most recent ABG with continued metabolic
   acidosis.
   - Pt on AC due to increasing acidosis overnight. Change to PS as
   tolerated
   - Sedation with propofol
   - Chest tube, pigtail catheter to allow for parenchymal reexpansion
   still draining >250cc fluid
   - Tumor decompression with radiation and chemotherapy to allow for
   improved ventilation (airway compression) and perfusion (vasculature
   compression)
   - sputum cx to eval for PNA
 pt does not have much sputum. Will send
   if/when sputum obtained.
   .
   #. Hypotension: Now with elevated BP although ranges from SBP 90-140s.
   Suspected initially to be secondary to adrenal insufficiency given
   hyperkalemia, acidosis. No evidence of adrenal hemorrhage, mass on CT
   abd/pelvis, although L adrenal slightly bulky. Differential also
   includes tension pneumothorax with improvement secondary to chest tube
   placement. Cardiac tamponade unlikely given absence of tamponade
   physiology on TTE. Septic shock possible given episode of hypothermia.
   - Continue hydrocortisone per endo recs
 decreased to hydrocortisone
   to 40mg q12hrs
   -Hold hydrocortisone on days when pt receives dexa for chemo
   - Management of pericardial and pleural effusions, as above
   -  send sputum cx to look for source of possible infection (not yet
   sent as pt has no/little sputum)
   - Monitor blood, urine cultures.
   .
   #. Probable small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor
   probably fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung.
   Given associated SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT
   [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head (head: PRELIM) negative for metastases.
   - Radiation therapy
 next session [**8-31**]
   - started on chemotherapy - etoposide, carboplatin
 Hem/Onc may
   increase etoposide
   - given allopurinol 300 mg once
   - given 2 L NS @ 150 cc/hr for chemo
 only during chemo
   - follow up tumor lysis markers qday per Hem/Onc
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam today
   compared to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   - Vascular surgery signed off- no stent; discuss code status
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**]. LDH
   effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria). Slightly elevated
   effusion protein. Normal glucose. Greatest concern for malignant
   effusion. Bacterial infection unlikely given lymphocyte predominance.
   Given lymphocyte predominance, may also consider TB as we do not know
   pt
s social or travel history although AFB screen of fluid negative.
   - Pigtail catheter
 once output <250cc, will d/w IP re: removal
   - f/u fluid cytology and cultures
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR. s/p chest tube placement.
   Unclear if this precipitated respiratory distress or rather was
   secondary to overinflation during resuscitation period. Risk factor
   with significant smoking history would be blebs.
   - Right chest tube in place
 will f/u with IP re: removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - Monitor pulsus paradoxus
   - f/u Cardiology recs
   - ECHO if exam changes
   .
   #. Hyponatremia:  Improving with Na 132 today. Differential includes
   SIADH given lung cancer, adrenal insufficiency given recent
   hyperkalemia and hypotension, decreased renal perfusion. Patient
   reportedly improved with fluid restriction, consistent with SIADH,
   although UNa <10 not consistent with this diagnosis. Also, Na did not
   decrease with NS given for chemo suggesting this may not be SIADH.
   Suspect mixed picture where patient also has decreased perfusion of
   kidneys secondary to SVC obstruction. [**Month (only) 11**] also be contribution of
   possible RTA type IV with hypoaldo and decreased sodium absorption,
   although UNa low.
   - Continue exogenous steroid therapy
   - Fluid restriction except when receiving fluids for chemotherapy
   (received NS 2L for chemo)
   -F/u endo recs
   -[**Month (only) 11**] get renal consult depending on endo recs
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Complicated by new repiratory acidosis
   overnight, but this resolved with change in vent settings in HPI.
   Nongap metabolic acidosis. No reported GI losses. Suspect dilutional
   secondary to fluid overload. Type IV RTA also possible despite normal
   creatinine; additionally, normal creatinine may be false reassurance
   for normal renal function given muscle wasting. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   post-hypocapneic (Increased respiratory alkalosis, perhaps when
   tachypneic, with renal wasting of HCO3; Pt
s alkalosis may have been
   quickly corrected when put on vent with delayed correction of HCO3)
   however, pt
s HCO3 was nl at admission making this unlikely.
   - may be type IV RTA
   - Monitor ABG
   - will f/u endo recs for renal insufficiency, possible renal consult
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  Improving WBC. No clear infection. Likely
   inflammatory response given malignancy, SVC syndrome. If concern for
   infection, will panculture.
   - Monitor blood, thoracentesis cultures
   - sent sputum cx if/when pt produces sputum
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm.
   - Continue antiepileptics
   .
   #. Hypertension: restart metoprolol 12.5 mg PO BID-  this is lower than
   home dose.

   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, who presented with respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, airway obstruction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, and hyponatremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia respiratory failure due to right upper lobe collapse, right pleural effusion, and resolution of right pneumothorax. She also has hypotension that may be secondary to adrenal insufficiency, tension pneumothorax, septic shock, or cardiac tamponade. The patient's metabolic acidosis is complicated by new respiratory acidosis overnight, but this resolved with changes in vent settings.

The patient has several medical complications including SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, hyponatremia, and anemia. She also has leukocytosis, which is improving, and may be due to an inflammatory response or infection.

The patient's treatment plan includes continued hydrocortisone therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, fluid restriction, and monitoring of tumor lysis markers. She also requires ongoing management of her pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and pericardial effusion.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening"

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) who has been admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy. The patient is currently experiencing multiple medical complications, including respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, airway obstruction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

The patient's respiratory failure is due to hypoxemia with a right upper and lower lobe collapse, right pleural effusion, and right pneumothorax. The SVC syndrome is causing facial swelling, mottled skin, and scleral edema. The patient has an exudative pleural effusion with lymphocyte predominance, which may indicate a malignant effusion. The pneumothorax is likely secondary to the patient's significant smoking history and overinflation during resuscitation. The pericardial effusion is suspected to be malignant but not large enough for percutaneous drainage. The patient also has hyponatremia, which could be due to SIADH, adrenal insufficiency, or decreased renal perfusion. There is also evidence of metabolic acidosis, possibly dilutional secondary to fluid overload or type IV RTA.

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with increased PSV to 14/5 and decreased propofol. She is also receiving heparin sodium (prophylaxis), pantoprazole (protonix), and other medications. The patient's lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and LDH, as well as abnormalities in electrolytes and kidney function.

Overall, the patient is critically ill with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) due to her underlying malignancy and its complications. The patient's code status is full code."

   Assessment and Plan
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**]) - weaning was attempted but
   patient was unable to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. Can retry
   wean today.
   - on chemotherapy and XRT now for SVC syndrome - seems to be some
   improvement in her clinical exam
   -pigtail continues to drain >250cc
   -IP recs
   Metabolic Acidosis - RTA from hypoaldo seems likely - endocrine recs to
   continue to decrease hydrocort
   Small Cell Lung Ca - heme/onc on board, receiving rads and chemo - will
   need MRI head
   on allopurinol and IVF to monitor tumor lysis syndrome
   going up on etoposide dosing today
   resuming radiation tomorrow
   Pericardial Eff - appears stable.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a complicated ICU course due to small cell lung cancer, SVC syndrome, right lung collapse, and MPE post chest tube placement. She has been started on chemotherapy and rested on AC overnight due to incomplete compensation for metabolic acidosis.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105-158 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her rhythm is sinus tachycardia.

The patient is intubated and sedated, with upper body edema including the face, and difficulty with accommodation. There are no abnormal lung sounds, and chest tubes are in place. The abdomen is benign, and extremities are warm. Neuro assessment is limited due to sedation.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 12.9 K/uL, hemoglobin of 9.7 g/dL, platelet count of 286 K/uL, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, TCO2 of 21 mmol/L, glucose levels ranging from 117-143 mg/dL, and an albumin level of 3.0 g/dL. Other lab values are within normal range.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen. The ventilator settings include a tidal volume of 500"

   58F with concern for small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pleural effusion, pericardial
   effusion, Pneumothorax, hyponatremia admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxemia respiratory failure:  No vent changes made overnight. Pt
   did not tolerate PS very well overnight. Several reasons for worsening
   respiratory failure, including right upper lobe collpase due to tumor,
   right pleural effusion. Right pneumothorax appears to have resolved. No
   significant secretions or mucus plugs seen on bronchoscopy [**8-26**]. Most
   likely with VQ mismatch because of compression of pulmonary
   vasculature. Pt spiked temperature, concern for VAP. Most recent ABG
   with continued metabolic acidosis.
   - Change to PS as tolerated
   - Sedation with propofol
   - Chest tube, pigtail catheter to allow for parenchymal reexpansion
   still draining >250cc fluid; per IP, continue with tubes at this time.
   - Tumor decompression with radiation and chemotherapy to allow for
   improved ventilation (airway compression) and perfusion (vasculature
   compression)
   - f/u sputum cx.

   # Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of pauses overnight on tele.
   Cards called
 reassuring that resumed beat is narrow complex
 lack of
   P wave suggests it may be junctional. This may have been positional,
   given that it occurred as pt was turned. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to worsening
   pericardial effusion although no electrical alternans on EKG during
   episodes. K slightly elevated but not at level to demonstrate EKG
   changes. Beta blocker was restarted yesterday, so concern for toxicity,
   although restarted at dose lower than home dose and glucagon had no
   effect. Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own without
   intervention.
   -Appreciate cards recs
   -Monitor tele
   -?repeat ECHO
   .
   #. Hypotension: Now with elevated BP although ranges from SBP 90-140s.
   Suspected initially to be secondary to adrenal insufficiency given
   hyperkalemia, acidosis. No evidence of adrenal hemorrhage, mass on CT
   abd/pelvis, although L adrenal slightly bulky. Differential also
   includes tension pneumothorax with improvement secondary to chest tube
   placement. Cardiac tamponade unlikely given absence of tamponade
   physiology on TTE. Septic shock possible given episode of hypothermia.
   - Continue hydrocortisone per endo recs
decrease Hydrocortisone to 20
   mg IV Q12H. Then 15mg AM, 10mg PM (?tmrw?).
   - Hold hydrocortisone on days when pt receives dexa for chemo
   - Management of pericardial and pleural effusions, as above
   - f/u cultures
   .
   #. Probable small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor
   probably fits into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung.
   Given associated SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT

   - Radiation therapy
 next session [**8-31**]
   - started on chemotherapy - etoposide, carboplatin
   - given 1 L NS @ 150 cc/hr for chemo
 only during chemo
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   - ? Team meeting with Hem/Onc and ICU team to discuss prognosis and
   goals of care prior to family meeting.
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam today
   compared to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   - Vascular surgery signed off- no stent; discuss code status
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**]. LDH
   effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria). Slightly elevated
   effusion protein. Normal glucose. Greatest concern for malignant
   effusion. Bacterial infection unlikely given lymphocyte predominance.
   Given lymphocyte predominance, may also consider TB as we do not know
   pt
s social or travel history although AFB screen of fluid negative.
   Keep tube in place per IP for now.
   - Pigtail catheter
 once output <250cc, will d/w IP re: removal
   - f/u fluid cytology and cultures
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR. s/p chest tube placement.
   Unclear if this precipitated respiratory distress or rather was
   secondary to overinflation during resuscitation period. Risk factor
   with significant smoking history would be blebs. Keep tube in place for
   now per IP.
   - Right chest tube in place
 will f/u with IP re: removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - Monitor pulsus paradoxus
   - ECHO if exam changes
   .
   #. Hyponatremia:  Improving with Na 139 today. Differential includes
   SIADH given lung cancer, adrenal insufficiency given recent
   hyperkalemia and hypotension, decreased renal perfusion. Patient
   reportedly improved with fluid restriction, consistent with SIADH,
   although UNa <10 not consistent with this diagnosis. Also, Na did not
   decrease with NS given for chemo suggesting this may not be SIADH.
   Suspect mixed picture where patient also has decreased perfusion of
   kidneys secondary to SVC obstruction. [**Month (only) 11**] also be contribution of
   possible RTA type IV with hypoaldo and decreased sodium absorption,
   although UNa low.
   - Continue exogenous steroid therapy
 decrease per Endo recs
   - Fluid restriction except when receiving fluids for chemotherapy
   (received NS 1L for chemo)
   - F/u endo recs
   -?Renal consult
 endo not very helpful re: why she
s hyponatremic w/
   inconsistent UNa.
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Complicated by new repiratory acidosis
   overnight, but this resolved with change in vent settings in HPI.
   Nongap metabolic acidosis. No reported GI losses. Suspect dilutional
   secondary to fluid overload. Type IV RTA also possible despite normal
   creatinine; additionally, normal creatinine may be false reassurance
   for normal renal function given muscle wasting. [**Month (only) 11**] also be
   post-hypocapneic (Increased respiratory alkalosis, perhaps when
   tachypneic, with renal wasting of HCO3; Pt
s alkalosis may have been
   quickly corrected when put on vent with delayed correction of HCO3)
   however, pt
s HCO3 was nl at admission making this unlikely.
   - may be type IV RTA
   - Monitor ABG
   - will f/u endo recs for renal insufficiency, possible renal consult
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 2 cycles
   chemotherapy. No clear infection although pt did have temp yesterday.
   Likely inflammatory response given malignancy, SVC syndrome.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Continue antiepileptics.
   .
   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c
d held in setting of pauses given
   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive. [**Month (only) 11**] restart
   metoprolol today.

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, and pneumothorax. She was admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy. 

The patient's current medical issues include hypoxemic respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, airway obstruction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, probable small cell lung carcinoma, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

The patient has been experiencing fever, tachypnea, and low oxygen saturation. Her ABG results show a metabolic acidosis with an increased lactate level. She also has an elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an inflammatory response or infection.

The patient's recent laboratory values show hyperkalemia, elevated lactate levels, and a slightly low sodium level. Her urine output has been decreased, but it improved after a bolus of normal saline.

The patient's physical examination reveals upper airway noise, bronchial breath sounds on the right, and pronounced S2 at the apex. She also has hypoactive bowel sounds and a soft, non-distended abdomen. Her extremities show edema in the upper body but no lower extrem"

   did not tolerate PS very well yesterday. Pt spiked temperature with new
   infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP given ventilator course.  Other
   causes of prolonged respiratory failure include right upper lobe
   collpase due to tumor. Right pleural effusion and right pneumothorax
   appear to have resolved.  No significant secretions or mucus plugs seen
   on bronchoscopy [**8-26**]. Most likely with VQ mismatch because of
   compression of pulmonary vasculature. Most recent ABG with continued
   metabolic acidosis.
   -Start vancomycin/cefepime to cover MRSA and pseudomonas for VAP
   - Change to PS as tolerated
 pt may require prolonged weaning course
   - Sedation with propofol
   - Chest tube will  most likely stay in place until extubation to
   prevent new pneumothorax
   - Tumor decompression with radiation and chemotherapy to allow for
   improved ventilation (airway compression) and perfusion (vasculature
   compression)
   - resend sputum culture
   .
   # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses overnight
   on tele. Cards was called
 reassuring that resumed beat is narrow
   complex
 lack of P wave suggests it may be junctional. This may have
   been positional, given that it occurred as pt was turned although it
   has continued today, less frequently. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to worsening
   pericardial effusion although no electrical alternans on EKG during
   episodes. K+ slightly elevated but not at level to demonstrate EKG
   changes. Beta blocker was restarted yesterday, so concern for toxicity,
   although restarted at dose lower than home dose and glucagon had no
   effect. Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own without
   intervention.
   -Continue to hold metoprolol
   -pacer pads in place and atropine at bedside
   -Things to watch for: HR<40, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat
   is wide complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   -Appreciate cards recs
   -Monitor tele
   -?repeat ECHO
   -Kayexalate 15mg PO x1 given hyperkalemia and electrical changes
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  Currently on chemotherapy and s/p XRT x2.
   - Stop checking tumor lysis labs
   - Radiation therapy
 no session today as pt getting chemo; t/b with
   rad onc re: next session
   - given 1 L NS @ 150 cc/hr for chemo
 fluids only needed during chemo
   - Appreciate Heme/onc recs
   - Team meeting with Hem/Onc and ICU team to discuss prognosis
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Improving with Na 139 today. Appears to be mixed
   picture of SIADH plus hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV RTA. Pt was
   not really fluid restricted given she received fluids for chemo with
   improvement of Na, and UNa low making SIADH less likely. Would also
   expect high UNa with hypoaldosteronism.  There may be some contribution
   of SVC obstruction leading to decreased kidney perfusion. Pt may have
   hypoaldosteronism without adrenal insufficiency, as endo thinks this is
   less likely now to be adrenal insufficiency.
   - Will d/w endocrinology re: clarification of hyponatremia and f/u recs
   - Continue fluids for chemotherapy
   - Hydrocortisone 15mg IV qAM and 10mg qPM per Endo
 will d/w endo need
   for hydrocortisone given pt receiving high dose dexa with chemotherapy,
   although dexamethasone has low mineralocorticoid action.
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: K increased to 5.3 today with sinus pauses on EKG.
   Unclear if they are related but concerning as this is new. [**Month (only) 11**] be due
   to chemotherapy and tumor lysis although remaining TL labs are normal.
   [**Month (only) 11**] also be due to hypoaldosteronism.
   -kayexalate 15mg PO x1
   -F/u Cardiology recs
   -F/u endocrinology recs
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Most likely due to hypoaldosteronism leading to
   Type IV RTA, although pt with normal creatinine.  Normal creatinine may
   be false reassurance for normal renal function given muscle wasting.
   - Monitor ABG
   - will f/u endo recs for hypoaldosteronism
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam today
   compared to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.
   - f/u fluid cytology and cultures
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages. [**Month (only) 11**]
   have contributed to sinus pauses overnight.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   - ECHO if exam changes
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 2 cycles
   chemotherapy. Pt most likely with VAP but leukopenia in setting of
   infection is also concerning.  [**Month (only) 11**] have also been due to inflammatory
   response given malignancy and SVC syndrome and is decreasing as they
   are treated.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   -Trend WBC
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   -If MS not improved in 2 days, will do repeat Head CT
   .
   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c
d held in setting of pauses given
   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive.
   -Continue holding metoprolol
   -Hydralazine to keep SBP 140s-160s.
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, presenting with respiratory failure, adrenal insufficiency, airway obstruction, electrolyte and fluid disorder, and SVC syndrome. The patient has been admitted for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus pauses on telemetry, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and a pericardial effusion. The patient's labs show elevated WBC count, anemia, and leukocytosis.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient did not tolerate pressure support well yesterday, so no vent changes were made overnight. The patient has a new infiltrate on CXR concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Other causes of prolonged respiratory failure include right upper lobe collapse due to tumor, resolved pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. The patient's most recent ABG shows continued metabolic acidosis. Start vancomycin/cefepime to cover MRSA and pseudomonas for VAP. Change to pressure support as tolerated. The patient may require prolonged weaning course. Sedation with propofol. Chest tube will most likely stay in place until extubation to prevent new pneumothorax.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorisl, primarily due to extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, montior ABG.  Initiate empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor sputum, await culture.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor
   HYPONATREMIA -- improved.  Attributed to adrenal insuff, hypaldo, SIADH
   - likely a mix of all of these.  Continue steroids.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   MENTAL STATUS
 consider re-imaging if no improvement when sedation
   d/c
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- resolving
 could be RTA secondary to
   hypoaldosteronism.  Continue to monitor.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.  Possible
   related to hilare mass, possible invovlement of conduction system.
   Monitor electrolytes.  Hold beta-blocker.  Cardiology Consultation in
   progress.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Consider TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old individual with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and SVC syndrome. The patient is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has experienced episodes of sinus pause last night, but without hemodynamic compromise.

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, primarily due to extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on the background of COPD. There are also new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's SVC syndrome has significantly improved over the past 48 hours, and the right pleural effusion has resolved following chest tube drainage.

The patient has a malignant right pneumothorax, for which a chest tube remains in place, with the lung fully expanded. There is no evidence of an air leak. The patient's small cell cancer is showing clinical response to radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

The patient's pericardial effusion does not exhibit signs of tamponade on examination, and the hypokalemia has improved. The patient's hypertension should be monitored, aiming to maintain systolic blood pressure between 140-160 mmHg.

The patient's mental status should be closely monitored, and re-imaging may be considered if there is no improvement when sedation is discontinued. The patient's metabolic acidosis is"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorisl, primarily due to extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP).  Continue
   mechanical ventilation, montior ABG.  Initiate empirical
   antimicrobials.  Monitor sputum, await culture.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor
   HYPONATREMIA -- improved.  Attributed to adrenal insuff, hypaldo, SIADH
   - likely a mix of all of these.  Continue steroids.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   MENTAL STATUS
 consider re-imaging if no improvement when sedation
   d/c
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- resolving
 could be RTA secondary to
   hypoaldosteronism.  Continue to monitor.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.  Possible
   related to hilare mass, possible invovlement of conduction system.
   Monitor electrolytes.  Hold beta-blocker.  Cardiology Consultation in
   progress.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Consider TF.

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated due to respiratory failure caused by extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right side, on the background of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). There are also new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, which are concerning for pneumonia, specifically ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

The patient's SVC syndrome has significantly improved over the past 48 hours. He continues to receive radiation therapy (XRT) and chemotherapy. His right pleural effusion has resolved after chest tube drainage, which was determined to be malignant. The chest tube has been removed, and there is no evidence of air leak.

The patient's small cell carcinoma is demonstrating a clinical response to XRT and chemotherapy. Radiation Oncology and Oncology services have been involved, providing recommendations and guidance. Monitoring for tumor lysis syndrome is essential.

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion tamponade on examination, so continued monitoring is recommended. The patient's hyponatremia has improved and is attributed to adrenal insufficiency, hypodole, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Steroids are being continued.

The patient's blood pressure needs to"

   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  No vent changes made overnight as pt
   did not tolerate PS very well yesterday. Pt spiked temperature with new
   infiltrate on CXR concerning for VAP given ventilator course.  Other
   causes of prolonged respiratory failure include right upper lobe
   collpase due to tumor. Right pleural effusion and right pneumothorax
   appear to have resolved.  No significant secretions or mucus plugs seen
   on bronchoscopy [**8-26**]. Most likely with VQ mismatch because of
   compression of pulmonary vasculature. Most recent ABG with continued
   metabolic acidosis.
   -Start vancomycin/cefepime to cover MRSA and pseudomonas for VAP
   - Change to PS as tolerated
 pt may require prolonged weaning course
   - Sedation with propofol
   - Chest tube will  most likely stay in place until extubation to
   prevent new pneumothorax
   - Tumor decompression with radiation and chemotherapy to allow for
   improved ventilation (airway compression) and perfusion (vasculature
   compression)

   # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses overnight
   on tele. Cards was called
 reassuring that resumed beat is narrow
   complex
 lack of P wave suggests it may be junctional. This may have
   been positional, given that it occurred as pt was turned although it
   has continued today, less frequently. [**Month (only) 11**] be related to worsening
   pericardial effusion although no electrical alternans on EKG during
   episodes. K+ slightly elevated but not at level to demonstrate EKG
   changes. Beta blocker was restarted yesterday, so concern for toxicity,
   although restarted at dose lower than home dose and glucagon had no
   effect. Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their own without
   intervention.
   -Continue to hold metoprolol

   picture of SIADH plus hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV RTA. Pt was
   not really fluid restricted given she received fluids for chemo with
   improvement of Na, and UNa low making SIADH less likely. Would also
   expect high UNa with hypoaldosteronism.  There may be some contribution
   of SVC obstruction leading to decreased kidney perfusion. Pt may have
   hypoaldosteronism without adrenal insufficiency, as endo thinks this is
   less likely now to be adrenal insufficiency.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, admitted for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. She has multiple medical complications, including hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus pauses on telemetry, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable with continued metabolic acidosis. She requires ventilatory support and is at risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Appropriate antibiotics have been started to cover MRSA and pseudomonas.
2. Sinus pauses on telemetry: The patient has experienced episodes of sinus pauses, which could be related to worsening pericardial effusion or positional changes. Further evaluation is needed, including a repeat ECHO and monitoring of telemetry.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium levels have increased, which may be due to chemotherapy-induced tumor lysis syndrome or hypoaldosteronism. Monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary.
4. Metabolic acidosis: The patient's acid-base balance is disrupted, likely due to hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV RTA. Endocrinology consultation is recommended for further evaluation and management.
5. SVC syndrome: The patient exhibits signs of superior vena cava syndrome, including upper extremity"

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion, and electrolyte disturbances. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has hypoxic respiratory failure with an increased respiratory rate from 14 to 20 for respiratory acidosis. There is also evidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with new infiltrates on the chest X-ray and worsening respiratory parameters.
2. Adrenal Insufficiency (AI): The patient has hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis, which may suggest hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV renal tubular acidosis (RTA). This could be due to SVC syndrome causing decreased kidney perfusion or possibly related to the underlying malignancy.
3. Hyperkalemia: The patient's potassium level is elevated at 5.3, which may be due to hypoaldosteronism or other causes such as tissue breakdown from malignancy.
4. Metabolic Acidosis: The patient has a persistent metabolic acidosis, likely due to hypoaldosteronism and Type IV RTA.
5. SVC Syndrome: The patient has incomplete occlusion of the superior vena cava, leading to upper"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorisl, primarily due to extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and completes chemoRx
   and XRT.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Continue XRT and
   chemotherapy.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor
   HYPONATREMIA -- improved.  Attributed to adrenal insuff, hypaldo, SIADH
   - likely a mix of all of these.  Continue steroids.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  Appears pre-renal, however
 continue net hydration.
   RENAL FAILURE -- rising creatinine, falling urine output.  Possible
   pre-renal.  Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   MENTAL STATUS
 consider re-imaging if no improvement when sedation
   d/c
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- resolving
 could be RTA secondary to
   hypoaldosteronism.  Continue to monitor.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.  Possible
   related to hilar mass, possible invovlement of conduction system.
   Possible vagal tone.  Monitor electrolytes.  Hold beta-blocker.
   Cardiology Consultation in progress.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- NPO.  Consider TF.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in respiratory failure due to extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on a background of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The patient also has evidence of new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). He is being treated with empirical antimicrobials and mechanical ventilation. The patient's SVC syndrome has improved over the past 48 hours, and he has resolved right pleural effusion and pneumothorax. His small cell cancer is responding to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The patient has hypotension, hypertension, fluid overload, renal failure, metabolic acidosis, sinus dysrhythmia, anemia, and is receiving nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, primarily due to extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on a background of COPD. The presence of new RLL and LLL infiltrates also raises concern for VAP.
2. Pneumonia: The new infiltrates in the RLL and LLL suggest the possibility of pneumonia. VAP is a common complication in mechanically ventilated"

   CXR
 The progressive interstitial pulmonary abnormality and right
   pleural effusion probably due to pulmonary edema. More severe
   consolidative abnormalities at both lung bases are also concerning for
   pneumonia. Right apical pleural tube in place. No pneumothorax. ET tube
   and nasogastric tube in standard placements. Heart size normal,
   unchanged. The bulk of the large right upper lobe mass has decreased
   over the past several days.
   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Increased RR from 14 to 20 for
   respiratory acidosis.  Pt spiked temperature with new infiltrate on CXR
   concerning for VAP given ventilator course.  Other causes of prolonged
   respiratory failure include right upper lobe collapse due to tumor.
   Right pleural effusion appears slightly worse today.  Right
   pneumothorax appear to have resolved.  No significant secretions or
   mucus plugs seen on bronchoscopy [**8-26**].  Most likely with VQ mismatch
   because of compression of pulmonary vasculature. Most recent ABG with
   continued metabolic acidosis.
   - decrease vancomycin to q24hrs for elevated creatinine today to cover
   MRSA VAP
   - continue cefepime to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP

   not really fluid restricted given she received fluids for chemo with
   improvement of Na, and UNa low making SIADH less likely. Would also
   expect high UNa with hypoaldosteronism.  There may be some contribution

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and Superior Vena Cava (SVC) syndrome. She has been admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus pauses on telemetry, small cell lung carcinoma, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's increased respiratory rate and low oxygen saturation indicate respiratory distress. This could be due to her underlying lung disease or complications such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. Sinus pauses on telemetry: The patient's episodes of sinus pauses may be related to worsening pericardial effusion or vagally mediated. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and heart rate is recommended, and a cardiology consult has been requested.
3. Small cell lung carcinoma: The patient's prognosis is likely poor given the aggressive nature of SCLC. Close monitoring of tumor lysis labs and follow-up with oncology recommendations is essential.
4. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium levels are low, which may be due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or hypoaldosteronism. Fluid"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, presenting with symptoms such as hypoxic respiratory failure, sinus pauses, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient's increased respiratory rate and metabolic acidosis indicate a worsening respiratory status. This could be due to a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or right upper lobe collapse caused by the tumor. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation, and efforts are being made to wean her off it.

2. SVC syndrome: The patient has incomplete occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC), leading to upper extremity and facial swelling. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are planned to decompress the SVC syndrome.

3. Pleural effusion: The patient had a right pleural effusion, which appears slightly worse today. The effusion is most likely malignant. Fluid cytology and cultures should be followed up.

4. Pneumothorax: The patient had a pneumothorax, but it appears resolved on the chest X-ray. The chest tube will most likely stay in place until the patient is extubated to prevent recurrence.

5. Pericardial effusion: Cardiology suspects"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Continues to have mixed respiratory
   and metabolic acidosis despite increasing RR yesterday.  Peak pressures
   in the high 38-40 and plat pressures of 30 last night so decreased TV
   and increased RR to maintain same MV of 12 but to decrease airway
   pressures. Pressure decreased slightly with these changes with plat of
   25.  Her oxygenation was worse last night with saturation decreased to
   91%.  Her PEEP was increased.  Respiratory status also complicated by
   possible underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR.
   - decrease vancomycin to q24hrs for elevated creatinine to cover MRSA
   VAP
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - plan to titrate down propofol and trial of fentanyl for pain
   management
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy.  Will need to touch base with heme/onc
   and rad/onc regarding plans for XRT or more chemo.
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   - IP checked Y stent placement on xray and looks the same, if continued
   problems with high pressures will consider future bronch
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol for almost 24
   hours and continues to not follow commands.  She does withdraw from
   noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for neuro exam.  Differential
   includes seizure (given hx), toxic metabolic, Infection, progression of
   cancer.  Will repeat her CT head today to eval for any changes and plan
   for EEG to eval for possible non-convulsive seizure activity.  Also
   plan for LP to eval for possible leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.
   - f/u EEG (with plans to consult neuro if abnormal)
   -f/u head CT read
   - LP with CSF sent for cytology and cx
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.
   - started neupogen yesterday with plan for 10 day course
   - will discuss with heme/onc and rad/onc their plans for future
   chemo/radiation
   - f/u heme/onc recs

   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Suspect
   chemo is cause although prerenal as well based on FeNa of 0.3.  RTA may
   also play a role.
   - gently hydrate with IVFs
   - f/u renal recs, plan to spin urine to look for sediment and casts
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - check vanc level
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Resolved with Na 140 today. Unclear etiology on
   admission as appeared to be mixed picture of SIADH plus
   hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV RTA.  However now thought by
   endocrine that pt was not adrenally insufficient or hypoaldo.  There
   may be some contribution of SVC obstruction leading to decreased kidney
   perfusion.
   - f/u any endocrine recs
   - patient appears prerenal on labs, increase free water flushes to 150
   cc q4hrs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Continues to have hyperkalemia without further episodes

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorisl, primarily due to extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and completes chemoRx
   and XRT.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL > LLL --> attributed to VAP.  Now on
   antimicrobials.  Monitor.
   MENTAL STATUS
 very slow to awken, now off Propofol >24 hrs.  Repeat
   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Underlying seizure disorder
   (on kepra) --> Plan EEG (continuous) to assess for non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  LP for CSF analysis (concern for carcinomatous
   meningitis).  Consider Neurological Consultation.  [**Month (only) 11**] be toxic
   metabolic.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Completed
   chemotherapy, continue XRT.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor.
   HYPONATREMIA -- improved.  Attributed to adrenal insufficiency,
   hypaldosteronism, SIADH --> possibly a mixture.  Continue steroids.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  However, appears pre-renal --> continue net hydration.
   Monitor I/O.
   RENAL FAILURE -- rising creatinine, falling urine output.  Possible
   pre-renal, possibly related to chemotherapy and recent contrast dye.
   Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- persistent, mild
 could be RTA secondary to
   hypoaldosteronism.  Continue to monitor.
   SEIZURE DISORDER -- continue kepra.  EEG to assess for non-convulsive
   status.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.  Possible
   related to hilar mass, possible invovlement of conduction system.
   Possible vagal tone.  Monitor electrolytes.  Hold beta-blocker.
   Cardiology Consultation -- possible vagal response, and without need
   for specific intervention.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   MICU Attending Addendum:
   Experienced bradycardia (junctional rhythm), hypotension and skin
   mottling.  Some improvement with suctioning, but significant resistance
   to catheter advancement.  Urgent bronchscopy revealed tip of ETT
   migrated between silcone Y-stent  and tracheal wall.  ETT repositioned
   under fiberoptic bronchoscopy guidance, and copious milky white
   secretions aspirated.  (See complete procedure note).  Tolerated well.
   BP, HR and SaO2 improved dramatically.

","The patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and superior vena cava syndrome. He is experiencing respiratory failure, primarily due to extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on a background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are also new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient has been started on empirical antimicrobials and will continue mechanical ventilation while monitoring arterial blood gases (ABG). Sputum culture is also being monitored. 

The patient's mental status is very slow to awaken and he is off propofol for over 24 hours. A repeat head CT did not reveal any new pathology. An MRI is not possible due to the presence of intracranial surgical clips. There is a plan for an electroencephalogram (EEG) to assess for non-convulsive status epilepticus. Lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is being performed to evaluate for carcinomatous meningitis. Neurological consultation is being considered, as the patient's mental status may be toxic metabolic.

The patient had SVC syndrome but it has improved over the past 48 hours. He has completed chemotherapy and is continuing radiation therapy. The right pleural effusion has resolved after chest tube drainage, which was malignant"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorisl, primarily due to extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and completes chemoRx
   and XRT.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL > LLL --> attributed to VAP.  Now on
   antimicrobials.  Monitor.
   MENTAL STATUS
 very slow to awken, now off Propofol >24 hrs.  Repeat
   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Underlying seizure disorder
   (on kepra) --> Plan EEG (continuous) to assess for non-convulsive
   status epilepticus.  LP for CSF analysis (concern for carcinomatous
   meningitis).  Consider Neurological Consultation.  [**Month (only) 11**] be toxic
   metabolic.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Completed
   chemotherapy, continue XRT.
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor.
   HYPONATREMIA -- improved.  Attributed to adrenal insufficiency,
   hypaldosteronism, SIADH --> possibly a mixture.  Continue steroids.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  However, appears pre-renal --> continue net hydration.
   Monitor I/O.
   RENAL FAILURE -- rising creatinine, falling urine output.  Possible
   pre-renal, possibly related to chemotherapy and recent contrast dye.
   Monitor urine output, BUN, creatinine.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- persistent, mild
 could be RTA secondary to
   hypoaldosteronism.  Continue to monitor.
   SEIZURE DISORDER -- continue kepra.  EEG to assess for non-convulsive
   status.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.  Possible
   related to hilar mass, possible invovlement of conduction system.
   Possible vagal tone.  Monitor electrolytes.  Hold beta-blocker.
   Cardiology Consultation -- possible vagal response, and without need
   for specific intervention.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis

The patient's medical history is significant for small cell carcinoma with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates in the right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL), which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is on empirical antimicrobials for VAP.

The patient's mental status is very slow to awaken and they are off Propofol for over 24 hours. A repeat head CT was unrevealing for new pathology. An MRI is not possible due to the presence of intracranial surgical clips. There is an underlying seizure disorder, and the plan is to perform an EEG (continuous) to assess for non-convulsive status epilepticus. A lumbar puncture (LP) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is also planned to assess for carcinomatous meningitis. A neurological consultation is considered.

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt had transient hypoxia with skin
   mottling yesterday afternoon and bronch revealed ETT lodged between
   tracheal wall and Y stent.  ETT was repositioned and hypoxia improved
   although pt was still autoPEEPing.  This AM her RR was decreased as she
   was breathing over it.  Respiratory status also complicated by possible
   underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR.
   - holding vanc as her level is elevated; will check level in AM and
   readjust dose as needed
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - plan to titrate down propofol and trial of fentanyl for pain
   management
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol and still not
   moving extremities or grossly following commands.  She does withdraw
   from noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for neuro exam.  Differential
   includes seizure (given hx), toxic metabolic, Infection, progression of
   cancer.  Repeat CT head unchanged from prior.  EEG today to eval for
   possible non-convulsive seizure activity.  Also plan for LP to eval for
   possible leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.
   - f/u EEG (with plans to consult neuro if abnormal)
   -f/u head CT read
   - LP and will send CSF sent for cytology and cx
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   needs formal tissue planning session to reduce amount they radiate;
   will wait until new scans/doing clinically better.  Rad/onc to do
   formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a bit
   Per heme/onc, it will be a few weeks before next round of chemo.
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - start neutropenic precautions
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Renal
   spun urine yesterday and casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize
   SBP 120s-130s, consider pRBCs to keep increased intravascular delivery
   to kidneys. Ordered renal US  for obstruction.
   - gently hydrate with IVFs
   - will check SvO2 to eval oxygenation and need for possible pRBC
   transfusion
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Realize this is now a gap metabolic acidosis as
   her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is likely related to
   uremia.  Goal pH is 7.3-7.35.
   - will f/u endo recs
   - f/u renal recs
   - started on Bicitra
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Unclear etiology on admission- thought to
   be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or
   possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommends
   rechecking urine lytes with saline load.  (In SIADH, UNa should
   increase and Uosm should remain high).
   - f/u any endocrine and renal recs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Continues to have hyperkalemia without further episodes
   of sinus pauses on EKG.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to hypoaldosteronism but unlikely
   per endocrine.  Etiology unclear. Not Type IV RTA b/c urine sodium not
   >30. Checking serum renin, aldosterone.  Could be hyperkalemia in the
   setting of cell death from chemo.

   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared
   to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.  Cytology nonspecific.
   Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   .
    # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**] without any since.  Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - as per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   - no urgent need for echo, but get one before pt is discharged from
   hospital
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 3 days of
   chemotherapy. Pt most likely with VAP but leukopenia in setting of
   infection is also concerning.  [**Month (only) 11**] have also been due to inflammatory
   response given malignancy and SVC syndrome and is decreasing as they
   are treated.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   -Trend WBC
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   -f/u repeat head CT read
   .
   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c
d held in setting of pauses given
   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive.
   -Continue holding metoprolol
   -Hydralazine PRN to keep SBP 140s-160s.
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

   Disposition: ICU
","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell lung carcinoma, who is currently admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's medical complications include hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, sinus pause on telemetry, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

The patient experienced transient hypoxia with skin mottling yesterday afternoon, and bronchoscopy revealed that the endotracheal tube (ETT) was lodged between the tracheal wall and Y stent. The ETT was repositioned, and hypoxia improved, although the patient was still autoPEEPing. The respiratory status is complicated by possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) given the patient's smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other pulmonary infection, and atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.

The patient's altered mental status is likely due to several factors, including seizure, toxic metabolic, infection, or progression of cancer. The repeat head CT remains unchanged from prior, and an EEG today will evaluate for possible non-convulsive seizure activity. A lumbar puncture (LP) will also be performed to"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Continues to have mixed respiratory
   and metabolic acidosis despite increasing RR yesterday.  Peak pressures
   in the high 38-40 and plat pressures of 30 last night so decreased TV
   and increased RR to maintain same MV of 12 but to decrease airway
   pressures. Pressure decreased slightly with these changes with plat of
   25.  Her oxygenation was worse last night with saturation decreased to
   91%.  Her PEEP was increased.  Respiratory status also complicated by
   possible underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR.
   - decrease vancomycin to q24hrs for elevated creatinine to cover MRSA
   VAP
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - plan to titrate down propofol and trial of fentanyl for pain
   management
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy.  Will need to touch base with heme/onc
   and rad/onc regarding plans for XRT or more chemo.
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   - IP checked Y stent placement on xray and looks the same, if continued
   problems with high pressures will consider future bronch
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol for almost 24
   hours and continues to not follow commands.  She does withdraw from
   noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for neuro exam.  Differential
   includes seizure (given hx), toxic metabolic, Infection, progression of
   cancer.  Will repeat her CT head today to eval for any changes and plan
   for EEG to eval for possible non-convulsive seizure activity.  Also
   plan for LP to eval for possible leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.
   - f/u EEG (with plans to consult neuro if abnormal)

   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT. -RAD ONC:
   Discussing with Med Onc, Don't know when Med Onc plans to give more
   chemo. Initially, XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated
   lots of nl tissue; needs formal tissue planning session to reduce
   amount they radiate; will wait until new scans/doing clinically better;
   Will do formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a
   bit. Small cell is responsive to chemo so hoping this will shrink so
   they can irradiate less and preserve more nl tissue.  -HEM/ONC: Chemo
   completed. Will be a few weeks before next round.
   - started neupogen yesterday with plan for 10 day course
   - will discuss with heme/onc and rad/onc their plans for future
   chemo/radiation

   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Suspect
   chemo is cause although prerenal as well based on FeNa of 0.3.  RTA may
   also play a role.
   - gently hydrate with IVFs
   - f/u renal recs, plan to spin urine to look for sediment and casts
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - check vanc level
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Resolved with Na 140 today.  Not Type IV RTA b/c urine
   sodium not >30 (If RTA Type IV, SC Heparin can cause this). Most likely
   ATN [**2-10**] hypoperfusion. Low UNa does not exclude SIADH (REc: recheck
   urine lytes with saline load- in SIADH, UNa should increase and Uosm
   should remain high), optimize BP 120s-130s, consider pRBCs to keep
   increased intravascular delivery to kidneys, check serum renin,
   aldosterone. Check renal US  for obstruction (ordered).
   Unclear etiology on admission as appeared to be mixed picture of SIADH
   plus hypoaldosteronism leading to Type IV RTA.  However now thought by
   endocrine that pt was not adrenally insufficient or hypoaldo.  There
   may be some contribution of SVC obstruction leading to decreased kidney
   perfusion.
   - f/u any endocrine recs
   - patient appears prerenal on labs, increase free water flushes to 150
   cc q4hrs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Continues to have hyperkalemia without further episodes
   of sinus pauses on EKG.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to hypoaldosteronism but unlikely
   per endocrine.  Etiology unclear.

   #. Metabolic acidosis:  -Acid/Base: so, looking at her ABG, she has a
   respiratory acidosis and a gap metabolic acidosis (which is why her pH
   is lower than you'd expect from either process alone). SO, up to this
   point, we've been saying her metabolic acidosis is non-gap and
   attributed to Type IV RTA (she may have been non-gap, or we may not
   have calculated it properly given her albumin). BUT, our differential
   is now MUDPILES. Her metabolic acidosis may be due to her uremia.

   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.

   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal

   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.

   .
    # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**] without any since.  Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - as per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   - no urgent need for echo, but get one before pt is discharged from
   hospital
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 2 cycles
   chemotherapy. Pt most likely with VAP but leukopenia in setting of
   infection is also concerning.  [**Month (only) 11**] have also been due to inflammatory
   response given malignancy and SVC syndrome and is decreasing as they
   are treated.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   -Trend WBC
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course

   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.

   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to

   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c

   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive.
   -Continue holding metoprolol
   -Hydralazine PRN to keep SBP 140s-160s.
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

   Disposition: ICU
","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung. She has been admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, acute renal failure, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, superior vena cava syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, sinus pause on telemetry, leukocytosis, anemia, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient continues to have mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis despite increasing respiratory rate. Peak pressures are high, and plate pressures are also elevated. The patient's oxygenation worsened last night, with saturation decreasing to 91%. PEEP was increased to address this issue. Underlying COPD, possible air stacking/trapping, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases, and potential pneumothorax are potential complications.

2. Altered mental status: The patient has been off propofol for almost 24 hours and continues not to follow commands. She withdraws from noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for a neurologic exam. Differential includes seizure (given history), toxic metabolic, infection, and progression of cancer. A repeat head CT is planned today to evaluate for any changes, and an EEG will be performed to evaluate"

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to respiratory failure caused by malpositioning/migration of the endotracheal tube (ETT) between the stent and tracheal wall, underlying extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, and background chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient also has pulmonary infiltrates in the right lower lobe (RLL) attributed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate that resolved overnight, and evidence of sepsis with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). He is being treated with antibiotics for VAP and receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient has a history of seizure disorder and is currently off propofol. Repeat head CT scan was unrevealing for new pathology, and an MRI is not possible due to the presence of intracranial surgical clips. A lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is planned to evaluate for carcinomatous meningitis. There is also concern for toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. The patient's SVC syndrome has improved over the past 48 hours, and he has completed chemotherapy. He is scheduled to undergo radiation therapy (XRT). The patient's small cell cancer"

   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt had transient hypoxia with skin
   mottling yesterday afternoon and bronch revealed ETT lodged between
   tracheal wall and Y stent.  ETT was repositioned and hypoxia improved
   although pt was still autoPEEPing.  This AM her RR was decreased as she
   was breathing over it.  Respiratory status also complicated by possible
   underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR.
   - holding vanc as her level is elevated; will check level in AM and
   readjust dose as needed
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - plan to titrate down propofol and trial of fentanyl for pain
   management
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol and still not
   moving extremities or grossly following commands.  She does withdraw
   from noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for neuro exam.  Differential
   includes seizure (given hx), toxic metabolic, Infection, progression of
   cancer.  Repeat CT head unchanged from prior.  EEG today to eval for
   possible non-convulsive seizure activity.  Also plan for LP to eval for
   possible leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.
   - f/u EEG (with plans to consult neuro if abnormal)
   -f/u head CT read
   - LP and will send CSF sent for cytology and cx
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   needs formal tissue planning session to reduce amount they radiate;
   will wait until new scans/doing clinically better.  Rad/onc to do
   formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a bit
   Per heme/onc, it will be a few weeks before next round of chemo.
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - start neutropenic precautions
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Renal
   spun urine yesterday and casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize
   SBP 120s-130s, consider pRBCs to keep increased intravascular delivery
   to kidneys. Ordered renal US  for obstruction.
   - gently hydrate with IVFs
   - will check SvO2 to eval oxygenation and need for possible pRBC
   transfusion
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Realize this is now a gap metabolic acidosis as
   her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is likely related to
   uremia.  Goal pH is 7.3-7.35.
   - will f/u endo recs
   - f/u renal recs
   - started on Bicitra
   .
   #. Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Unclear etiology on admission- thought to
   be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or
   possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommends
   rechecking urine lytes with saline load.  (In SIADH, UNa should
   increase and Uosm should remain high).
   - f/u any endocrine and renal recs
   .
   # Hyperkalemia: Continues to have hyperkalemia without further episodes
   of sinus pauses on EKG.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to hypoaldosteronism but unlikely
   per endocrine.  Etiology unclear. Not Type IV RTA b/c urine sodium not
   >30. Checking serum renin, aldosterone.  Could be hyperkalemia in the
   setting of cell death from chemo.

   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared
   to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.  Cytology nonspecific.
   Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   .
    # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**] without any since.  Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - as per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   - no urgent need for echo, but get one before pt is discharged from
   hospital
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 3 days of
   chemotherapy. Pt most likely with VAP but leukopenia in setting of
   infection is also concerning.  [**Month (only) 11**] have also been due to inflammatory
   response given malignancy and SVC syndrome and is decreasing as they
   are treated.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   -Trend WBC
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   -f/u repeat head CT read
   .
   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c
d held in setting of pauses given
   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive.
   -Continue holding metoprolol
   -Hydralazine PRN to keep SBP 140s-160s.
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung. She was admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. The patient has multiple medical complications, including acute respiratory failure, altered mental status, tachycardia, renal failure, adrenal insufficiency, electrolyte and fluid disorder, hypoxic respiratory failure, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, SVC syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, sinus pause, leukocytosis, anemia, and a history of cerebral aneurysm repair.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has experienced hypoxic respiratory failure and acute respiratory failure. She is currently on mechanical ventilation, and her respiratory status is complicated by possible underlying COPD, air trapping, and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, which could be due to various factors such as seizure activity, toxic metabolic state, infection, or progression of cancer. An EEG is pending to evaluate for possible non-convulsive seizure activity, and a lumbar puncture has been done to evaluate for leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.

3. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, possibly related to chemotherapy with carboplatin. She is oliguric with a creatinine level of"

    # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**] without any since.  Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - as per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion, and electrolyte disturbances. She is currently admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.

The patient's current condition includes hypoxic respiratory failure, altered mental status, tachycardia, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), adrenal insufficiency, airway obstruction, central/upper, and electrolyte & fluid disorder.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had transient hypoxia with skin mottling yesterday afternoon, and an endotracheal tube (ETT) was lodged between the tracheal wall and Y-stent. The ETT was repositioned, and hypoxia improved, although the patient is still autoPEEPing. This morning, her respiratory rate decreased as she was breathing over it. The patient's respiratory status is also complicated by possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) given her smoking history with possible air stacking/trapping, possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other pulmonary infection, atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases. The chest tube will stay in place as per interventional procedure recommendations until the patient is off the ventilator.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorial, malpositioning/migration of ETT
   between stent and tracheal wall.  Also underlying extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL  --> attributed to VAP.  Now on
   antimicrobials.  Monitor.  LLL infiltrate resolved over past 24 hrs,
   suspect related to mucus plug and /or atalectasis.
   MENTAL STATUS
 very slow to awken, now off Propofol >24 hrs.  Repeat
   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Underlying seizure disorder
   (on kepra) --> await EEG interpretation.   No evidence for
   carcinomatous meningitis by LP.  Consider Neurological Consultation.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be toxic metabolic.
   SVC SYNDROME
 mucy improved over initial 48 hrs following XRT.
   Completed chemotherapy.  Limited subsequent change.  Monitor exam.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation [**Month (only) 4774**] and [**Month (only) 4774**] services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.  Plan repeat Chest CT to assess
   influence of XRT and chemotherapy on tumor mass.
   NEUTROPENIA
 continue precautions.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for ATN (muddy brown casts on UA).  Prerenal
   and contrast dye induced.  COntinue bicitra
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.  No radiographic evidence for
   reaccumulation.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  However, appears pre-renal --> continue net hydration.
   Monitor I/O.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- persistent, positive anion gap
 attributed to
   acute renal failure and ATN.  Continue to monitor.
   SEIZURE DISORDER
 No active seizures.  Continue kepra.  EEG to assess
   for non-convulsive status.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.
   Attributed to vagal tone, possible related to hilar mass, possible
   invovlement of conduction system.  No intervention at this time.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU due to respiratory failure. The patient has been treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy for his cancer.

The patient's current conditions include pulmonary infiltrates on the right lower lobe (RLL), which are attributed to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP); left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrate that resolved over the past 24 hours; mental status changes; SVC syndrome; neutropenia; renal failure with acute tubular necrosis (ATN); right pleural effusion, which has resolved; right pneumothorax; pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade; hypertension; positive fluid balance likely related to chemotherapy agents; metabolic acidosis with an anion gap; seizure disorder; sinus dysrhythmia; and anemia.

The patient is receiving nutritional support through tube feeding, and his glycemic control is being monitored. Prophylactic measures include stress ulcer prophylaxis, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, and elevation of head of bed (HOB) to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is in the ICU. The attending physician spent a total of 45 minutes with the patient. The patient is critically ill, and"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorial, malpositioning/migration of ETT
   between stent and tracheal wall.  Also underlying extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL  --> attributed to VAP.  Now on
   antimicrobials.  Monitor.  LLL infiltrate resolved over past 24 hrs,
   suspect related to mucus plug and /or atalectasis.
   MENTAL STATUS
 very slow to awken, now off Propofol >24 hrs.  Repeat
   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Underlying seizure disorder
   (on kepra) --> await EEG interpretation.   No evidence for
   carcinomatous meningitis by LP.  Consider Neurological Consultation.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be toxic metabolic.
   SVC SYNDROME -- much improved over past 48 hrs.  Completed
   chemotherapy, continue XRT.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.  Plan repeat Chest CT to assess
   influence of XRT and chemotherapy on tumor mass.
   NEUTROPENIA
 continue precautions.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for ATN (muddy brown casts on UA).  Prerenal
   and contrast dye induced.  COntinue bicitra
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.  No radiographic evidence for
   reaccumulation
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  However, appears pre-renal --> continue net hydration.
   Monitor I/O.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- persistent, positive anion gap
 attributed to
   acute renal failure and ATN.  Continue to monitor.
   SEIZURE DISORDER -- continue kepra.  EEG to assess for non-convulsive
   status.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.
   Attributed to vagal tone, possible related to hilar mass, possible
   invovlement of conduction system.  No intervention at this time.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. The patient has respiratory failure due to malpositioning/migration of the endotracheal tube (ETT), underlying extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on the background of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are also new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 

The patient has mental status changes, which are very slow to awaken and now off propofol for over 24 hours. A repeat head CT scan was unrevealing for new pathology. An MRI is not possible due to the presence of intracranial surgical clips. There is an underlying seizure disorder, but no evidence for carcinomatous meningitis by lumbar puncture. An EEG is pending for seizure disorder assessment. 

The patient has shown improvement in SVC syndrome over the past 48 hours, after completing chemotherapy and continuing radiation therapy. The small cell cancer is demonstrating a clinical response to X-ray therapy and chemotherapy. 

Other complications include neutropenia, renal failure with muddy brown casts on urinalysis indicating acute tubular necrosis (ATN), right pleural effusion that has resolved after chest tube drainage,"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yof with new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma  with SVC syndrome
   (partial compression), airway compromise (requiring Y-stent).
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE
 multifactorial, malpositioning/migration of ETT
   between stent and tracheal wall.  Also underlying extrinsic and
   intrinsic narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right, on
   background of COPD(?).  Also evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonai (VAP) -->
   empirical antimicrobials.  Continue mechanical ventilation, montior
   ABG.  Monitor sputum, await culture.  Hope to eventually work towards
   SBT and extubation once completes VAP treatment and mental status.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL  --> attributed to VAP.  Now on
   antimicrobials.  Monitor.  LLL infiltrate resolved over past 24 hrs,
   suspect related to mucus plug and /or atalectasis.
   MENTAL STATUS
 very slow to awken, now off Propofol >24 hrs.  Repeat
   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Underlying seizure disorder
   (on kepra) --> await EEG interpretation.   No evidence for
   carcinomatous meningitis by LP.  Consider Neurological Consultation.
   [**Month (only) 11**] be toxic metabolic.
   SVC SYNDROME
 mucy improved over initial 48 hrs following XRT.
   Completed chemotherapy.  Limited subsequent change.  Monitor exam.
   SMALL CELL CA -- demonstating clinical response to XRT and
   chemotherapy.   Radiation Oncology and Oncology services involve
   appreciate recommendations and guidance.  Monitor for tumor lysis.
   Need to better define prognosis.  Plan repeat Chest CT to assess
   influence of XRT and chemotherapy on tumor mass.
   NEUTROPENIA
 continue precautions.
   RENAL FAILURE -- evidence for ATN (muddy brown casts on UA).  Prerenal
   and contrast dye induced.  COntinue bicitra
   RIGHT PLEURAL EFFUSION -- resolved, s/p chest tube drainage.
   Malignant.  Chest tube now removed.  No radiographic evidence for
   reaccumulation.
   RIGHT PNEUMOTHORAX -- chest tube remains in place, lung fully
   expanded.  No evidence for air leak.
   PERICARDIAL EFFUSION -- no evidence of tamponade on exam
 continue to
   monitor.
   HYPERTENSION
 monitor BP.  Maintain SBP 140-160 mmHg
   FLUIDS -- positive fluid balance, likely related to chemotherapy
   agents.  However, appears pre-renal --> continue net hydration.
   Monitor I/O.
   METABOLIC ACIDOSIS  -- persistent, positive anion gap
 attributed to
   acute renal failure and ATN.  Continue to monitor.
   SEIZURE DISORDER
 No active seizures.  Continue kepra.  EEG to assess
   for non-convulsive status.
   SINUS DYSRHYTHMIA
 sinus pauses, no hemodynamic compromise.
   Attributed to vagal tone, possible related to hilar mass, possible
   invovlement of conduction system.  No intervention at this time.
   Monitor.
   ANEMIA -- stable, no evidence of hemolysis
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. He is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) and is experiencing respiratory failure due to malpositioning/migration of endotracheal tube (ETT), underlying extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi on the right, and new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, which are concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation and empirical antimicrobials for VAP. His mental status is very slow to awaken, possibly due to a toxic-metabolic encephalopathy. An MRI is not possible due to the presence of intracranial surgical clips, and an EEG is pending to evaluate for non-convulsive status. The patient has completed chemotherapy and radiation therapy, showing clinical response to treatment. He also has a history of seizure disorder and right-sided pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, hypertension, positive fluid balance, metabolic acidosis, and sinus dysrhythmia. The patient's nutritional support includes enteral feeding through a feeding tube (TF)."

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy and chemotherapy, now with respiratory failure,
   renal failure and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt desaturated yesterday and on
   bronchoscopy, ETT noted to be again displaced between stent and trachea
   wall. It was repositioned. Pt also with leak in ETT given it
s high
   position over stent so increasing tidal volume worsens leak. Pt still
   acidotic with RR 28
 little room to increase RR.  Respiratory status
   also complicated by possible underlying COPD given smoking history with
   possible air stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary
   infection, atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not
   seen on CXR. Also with b/l pleural effusions seen on CT although tumor
   has decreased.
   - holding vanc as her level is elevated; will check level in AM and
   readjust dose as needed
 continue holding today (d1 = [**2172-8-31**]; 8 day
   course)
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy; scheduled for formal planning for XRT
   early next week (approx [**2172-9-8**])
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol >48h and still
   not moving extremities or grossly following commands. Most likley toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy as pt is uremic. Differential includes seizure
   although EEG does not demonstrate seizure activity. LP does not
   demonstrate infection or spread of malignancy. CT head negative for
   acute process.
   - f/u  CSF studies
   - Consider neuro consult
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Urine
   casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize SBP 120s-130s.- - gently
   hydrate with IVFs
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Realize this is now a gap metabolic acidosis as
   her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is likely related to
   uremia.  Unable to increase RR due to concern for autopeeping in
   setting of possible COPD. Goal pH is 7.3-7.35.
   - will f/u endo and renal recs
   - continue on Bicitra
   - If pH continues to decrease below 7.2, will need bicarb
   .
   # Tachycardia/Hypotension
 Pt with continued tachycardia and episodes
   of hypotension. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (pulsus not helpful in setting of intubation per
   earlier cardiology note), pneumothorax. Pt appears to be in A-fib on
   monitor but difficult to tell. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged
   bed rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not
   helpful in setting of lung changes.

   -t/b with Hem/Onc re: anti-coagulation given tumor treatment
   .
   #. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt now with hypernatremia most likley due
   to dehydration with free water deficit of 1.4L, started on D5W
   overnight. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission, both
   resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte disturbances on admission-
   thought to be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now
   discarded) or possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal
   recommends rechecking urine lytes with saline load, not yet done in
   setting of pt
s other medical issues.  (In SIADH, UNa should increase
   and Uosm should remain high).
   - f/u any endocrine and renal recs

   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   needs formal tissue planning session to reduce amount they radiate;
   will wait until new scans/doing clinically better.  Rad/onc to do
   formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a bit
   Per heme/onc, it will be a few weeks before next round of chemo.
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
 per Hem/Onc, decreased WBC ct
   in setting of neupogen does not bode well.
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared
   to admission. Per family, pt did not have SVC syndrome when she came to
   hospital ([**Hospital Unit Name 10**] team thought she had it on presentation to ED). SVC
   syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor pushing
   into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent placement.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   -F/u Hem/Onc recs
   .
   # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**]. Had new episdoes, again with turning.  Cardiology
   consult thinks it
s vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency
   and duration on their own without intervention.
   - Care with turning patient
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - Per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   .
   #Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia
 most likely due to chemotherapy. Pt on
   neupogen with continued decreased counts. Per Onc, this does not bode
   well for prognosis. Low suspicion for HITT
   -F/u hem/onc recs
   -Trend CBC
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.  Cytology nonspecific.
   Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   .
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive (see above). Metoprolol d/c
d held in
   setting of pauses given concern for beta blocker toxicity. -Continue
   holding metoprolol
   -D/c hydralazine as pt is hypotensive
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion, and pneumothorax. The patient was admitted for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. She is now experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient desaturated yesterday, and bronchoscopy revealed that the endotracheal tube (ETT) was displaced between the stent and tracheal wall. The ETT was repositioned, but the patient still has a leak due to its high position over the stent. Increasing tidal volume worsens the leak. The patient is acidotic with a respiratory rate of 28, and there is little room to increase the respiratory rate. The respiratory status is also complicated by possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), possible ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases. Pneumothorax is not seen on the chest X-ray (CXR), but bilateral pleural effusions are seen on computed tomography (CT). The tumor has decreased in size.

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, and electrolytes disturbances
   admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt had transient hypoxia with skin
   mottling yesterday afternoon and bronch revealed ETT lodged between
   tracheal wall and Y stent.  ETT was repositioned and hypoxia improved
   although pt was still autoPEEPing.  This AM her RR was decreased as she
   was breathing over it.  Respiratory status also complicated by possible
   underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR.
   - holding vanc as her level is elevated; will check level in AM and
   readjust dose as needed
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - plan to titrate down propofol and trial of fentanyl for pain
   management
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol and still not
   moving extremities or grossly following commands.  She does withdraw
   from noxious stimuli but cannot cooperate for neuro exam.  Differential
   includes seizure (given hx), toxic metabolic, Infection, progression of
   cancer.  Repeat CT head unchanged from prior.  EEG today to eval for
   possible non-convulsive seizure activity.  Also plan for LP to eval for
   possible leptomeningeal spread of her cancer.
   - f/u EEG (with plans to consult neuro if abnormal)
   -f/u head CT read
   - LP and will send CSF sent for cytology and cx
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   needs formal tissue planning session to reduce amount they radiate;
   will wait until new scans/doing clinically better.  Rad/onc to do
   formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a bit
   Per heme/onc, it will be a few weeks before next round of chemo.
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - start neutropenic precautions
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Renal
   spun urine yesterday and casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize
   SBP 120s-130s, consider pRBCs to keep increased intravascular delivery
   to kidneys. Ordered renal US  for obstruction.
   - gently hydrate with IVFs
   - will check SvO2 to eval oxygenation and need for possible pRBC
   transfusion
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Realize this is now a gap metabolic acidosis as
   her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is likely related to
   uremia.  Goal pH is 7.3-7.35.

   #. Hyponatremia: Resolved.  Unclear etiology on admission- thought to
   be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now discarded) or
   possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal recommends
   rechecking urine lytes with saline load.  (In SIADH, UNa should
   increase and Uosm should remain high).
   - f/u any endocrine and renal recs

   # Hyperkalemia: Continues to have hyperkalemia without further episodes
   of sinus pauses on EKG.  [**Month (only) 11**] be due to hypoaldosteronism but unlikely
   per endocrine.  Etiology unclear. Not Type IV RTA b/c urine sodium not
   >30. Checking serum renin, aldosterone.  Could be hyperkalemia in the
   setting of cell death from chemo.

   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared
   to admission.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression

   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.  Cytology nonspecific.
   Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   .
    # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**] without any since.  Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - as per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   - no urgent need for echo, but get one before pt is discharged from
   hospital
   .
   #. Leukocytosis:  WBC trending downwards possibly due to 3 days of
   chemotherapy. Pt most likely with VAP but leukopenia in setting of
   infection is also concerning.  [**Month (only) 11**] have also been due to inflammatory
   response given malignancy and SVC syndrome and is decreasing as they
   are treated.
   - Monitor blood, urine, sputum, thoracentesis cultures
   -Trend WBC
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course

   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   -f/u repeat head CT read
   .
   #. Hypertension: Metoprolol d/c
d held in setting of pauses given
   concern for beta blocker toxicity. Pt remains hypertensive.
   -Continue holding metoprolol
   -Hydralazine PRN to keep SBP 140s-160s.
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung and several complications. She is admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy.

The patient's medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypoxic respiratory failure: The patient had transient hypoxia with skin mottling yesterday afternoon due to an endotracheal tube (ETT) lodged between the tracheal wall and Y stent. The ETT was repositioned, and hypoxia improved, but the patient is still at risk for underlying COPD, possible air stacking/trapping, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases, and pneumothorax.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been off propofol and is not moving extremities or following commands. She only withdraws from noxious stimuli. Differential includes seizure (given history), toxic metabolic, infection, and progression of cancer. An EEG today will evaluate for possible non-convulsive seizure activity, and a lumbar puncture (LP) will be done to evaluate for possible leptomeningeal spread of cancer.
3. SVC syndrome: The patient has incomplete occlusion of the superior vena cava (SVC), resulting in upper extremity and facial swelling/plethora. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy have been initiated for decompression.

   narrowing of distal trachea and bronchi on the right [**2-10**] mass,
   background of probable COPD, and evidence for new RLL and LLL
   (retrocardiac) infiltrates, concerning for pneumonia (VAP).  Continue
   empiric antimicrobials (vanco,cipro,cef) to complete 8 day course,
   following vanco levels.  Continue mechanical ventilation--AC now with
   increasing O2 requirements.  Her MS and high rate requierements
   continue to prevent weaning.  monitor ABG and adjust vent to optimize.
   Monitor sputum and f/u cx data.
   PULMONARY INFILTRATES -- RLL  --> attributed to VAP.  Now on

   suspect related to mucus plug and /or atalectasis.
   MENTAL STATUS

   head CT unrevealing for new pathology.  MRI not possible due to
   presence of intracranial surgical clips.  Prior aneurysm repai on

   evidence of sz on eeg. No evidence for carcinomatous meningitis by LP.
   Consider Neurological Consultation.  Appears most c/w toxic metabolic
   emncephalopathy. follow neuro exam.
   Tachycardia/hypotensive--DDX includes--? new infection (on broad
   empiric coverage),  tension pnx, worsening PERICARDIAL EFFUSION vs
   PE.   Bolus, repeat cxr stat and consider repeat echo to assess for
   tamponade.  Check stat ecg to better assess. Given ARF would hold onh
   repeat CTA.  Check dopplers.
   SVC SYNDROME

   NEUTROPENIA
 continue precautions.
   Thrombocytopenia--likely chemo related, low clionical suspicion for

   RENAL FAILURE -- worsening cr.  Evidence for ATN (muddy brown casts on
   UA). Renal is following.  Continue bicitra and fluids.  no indication
   for colloid at this time.  avoid nephrotoxins and renally dose meds.
   MET ACIDOSIS-- Gap--Likely from uremia in setting of renal failure.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old individual with a new diagnosis of small cell carcinoma, presenting with superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, and pneumothorax. The patient was admitted for radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including malpositioning/migration of endotracheal tube (ETT), underlying extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi, probable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and evidence for new right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates, concerning for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antimicrobials, mechanical ventilation, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is complex and multifactorial. The airway compromise due to the migration of ETT between the stent and tracheal wall, underlying extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi, probable COPD, and new LLL infiltrate attributed to VAP pose significant challenges. Continuous monitoring and optimization of mechanical ventilation, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy, are essential.

2. Pneumonia: The presence of new RLL and LLL infiltrates raises concerns for pneumonia. Continued surveillance of sputum and follow-up chest X-ray"

1. Tension pneumothorax: The patient has a history of airway collapse and right pneumonia, which increases the risk of tension pneumothorax.
2. Pericardial effusion/tamponade: The patient's tachycardia and hypotension may be indicative of cardiac tamponade, especially considering the presence of a pericardial effusion.
3. Pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient's tachycardia and hypotension could also be due to a PE, particularly given the immobilization and malignancy.
4. Infection: The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected VAP. However, there"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy and chemotherapy, now with respiratory failure,
   renal failure and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt still acidotic with RR 28
 little
   room to increase RR. Numerous changes made to ventilator and tube
   placement yesterday.  Respiratory status also complicated by possible
   underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR. Also with b/l pleural effusions seen on CT although tumor has
   decreased.
   - holding vanc as her level is elevated (therapeutic today); will check
   level in AM and readjust dose as needed
 continue holding today (d1 =
   [**2172-8-31**]; 8 day course)
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover MRSA and pseudomonas VAP
   - wean ventilator as tolerated, likely to stay on AC today
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy; scheduled for formal planning for XRT
   early next week (approx [**2172-9-8**])
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol >48h and still
   not moving extremities or grossly following commands. Most likley toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy as pt is uremic. Differential includes seizure
   although EEG does not demonstrate seizure activity. LP does not
   demonstrate infection or spread of malignancy. CT head negative for
   acute process.
   - f/u  CSF studies
   - Consider neuro consult
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: In setting of chemo with carboplatin.  Urine
   casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize SBP 120s-130s.- - gently
   hydrate with IVFs
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis:  Realize this is now a gap metabolic acidosis as
   her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is likely related to
   uremia.  Unable to increase RR due to concern for autopeeping in
   setting of possible COPD. Goal pH is 7.3-7.35.
   - will f/u endo and renal recs
   - continue on Bicitra
   - If pH continues to decrease below 7.2, will need bicarb
   .
   # Tachycardia/Hypotension
 Pt with continued tachycardia and episodes
   of hypotension. DDx includes possible enlarging pericardial
   effusion/tamponade (pulsus not helpful in setting of intubation per
   earlier cardiology note), pneumothorax. Pt appears to be in A-fib on
   monitor but difficult to tell. PE likely given malignancy and prolonged
   bed rest but unable to do CTA given renal failure and VQ scan not
   helpful in setting of lung changes.
   -CXR
   -EKG to evaluate for A-fib
   -Fluids to give preload for hypotensive episodes
   -Cardiology consult for STAT echo
   -LENI
s as unable to directly assess for PE
   -t/b with Hem/Onc re: anti-coagulation given tumor treatment
   .
   #. Electrolyte disturbances: Pt now with hypernatremia most likley due
   to dehydration with free water deficit of 1.4L, started on D5W
   overnight. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission, both
   resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte disturbances on admission-
   thought to be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now
   discarded) or possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal
   recommends rechecking urine lytes with saline load, not yet done in
   setting of pt
s other medical issues.  (In SIADH, UNa should increase
   and Uosm should remain high).
   - f/u any endocrine and renal recs
   -F/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] and renin
   .
   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   needs formal tissue planning session to reduce amount they radiate;
   will wait until new scans/doing clinically better.  Rad/onc to do
   formal planning session next Tues or so to let chemo work for a bit
   Per heme/onc, it will be a few weeks before next round of chemo.
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
 per Hem/Onc, decreased WBC ct
   in setting of neupogen does not bode well.
   - f/u heme/onc recs
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Also with scleral edema.
   Unable to assess jugular venous distension given considerable swelling.
   Seen in appoximately 10% cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared
   to admission. Per family, pt did not have SVC syndrome when she came to
   hospital ([**Hospital Unit Name 10**] team thought she had it on presentation to ED). SVC
   syndrome occurred after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor pushing
   into trachea shifted to compress SVC after stent placement.
   - Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for decompression
   -F/u Hem/Onc recs
   .
   # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**]. Had new episdoes, again with turning.  Cardiology
   consult thinks it
s vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency
   and duration on their own without intervention.
   - Care with turning patient
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - Per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, if resumed beat is wide
   complex; dopamine will be pressor of choice
   .
   #Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia
 most likely due to chemotherapy. Pt on
   neupogen with continued decreased counts. Per Onc, this does not bode
   well for prognosis. Low suspicion for HITT.
   -F/u hem/onc recs
   -Trend CBC
   .
   #. Pleural effusion:  s/p right pigtail catheter placement [**2172-8-25**],
   removed [**2172-8-31**]. LDH effusion/serum 0.68 (exudate by Light
s criteria).
   Greatest concern for malignant effusion.  Cytology nonspecific.
   Cultures of fluid all preliminary negative.
   .
   #. Pneumothorax:  appears resolved on CXR.
   - Will keep tube in place most likely until pt extubated to prevent
   recurrence of pneumothorax with removal
   .
   #. Pericardial effusion:  Suspected by cardiology to be malignant
   effusion. Felt not to be large enough for percutaneous drainage. EKG
   without signs of electrical alternans but does have low voltages.
   - F/u cardiology recs
   .
   #. Anemia:  Normocytic. Hct stable. Most acute concern would be DIC;
   LDH elevated although bilirubin normal. Haptoglobin normal. ACD
   possible given malignancy.
   - Trend hematocrit
   .
   #. s/p cerebral aneurysm repair:  Unclear why patient is disposed to
   having cerebral aneurysm. Pt mental status difficult to assess. She has
   a number of chronic changes on head CT.
   -continue antiepileptics.
   .
   #. Hypertension: Now hypotensive (see above). Metoprolol d/c
d held in
   setting of pauses given concern for beta blocker toxicity. -Continue
   holding metoprolol
   -D/c hydralazine as pt is hypotensive
   -Monitor propofol and BP carefully when giving hydralazine to avoid
   hypotensive episodes
   .
   #Goals of care: discuss with family that pt is in multisystem organ
   failure and prognosis is poor.

","The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung, complicated by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax. The patient is currently admitted to the ICU for radiation decompression therapy and chemotherapy. She is now experiencing hypoxic respiratory failure, renal failure, and altered mental status.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by possible underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), air trapping, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases. The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions seen on CT, although the tumor has decreased. The patient's chest tube will remain in place as per interventional pulmonology recommendations until the patient is off the ventilator.

The patient has altered mental status, most likely due to toxic metabolic encephalopathy as she is uremic. The differential includes seizure, although the electroencephalogram (EEG) does not demonstrate seizure activity. The lumbar puncture (LP) does not demonstrate infection or spread of malignancy. The head CT is negative for acute process.

The patient has acute renal failure in the setting of chemotherapy with carboplatin. Urine casts consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) have been observed. The plan is to optimize systemic blood pressure (SBP)"

   Assessment and Plan
   58F with likely small cell carcinoma complicated by SVC syndrome,
   airway compromise requiring Y-stent, pericardial effusion, resolved
   pleural effusion and pneumothorax, admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 10**] for radiation
   decompression therapy and chemotherapy, now with respiratory failure,
   renal failure and altered mental status.
   .
   #. Hypoxic respiratory failure:  Pt still acidotic due to repiratory
   and metabolic acidosis, improved with HCO3 administration overnight.
   However pt with high RR requirement to compensate for acidosis with
   little room to increase RR. Numerous changes made to ventilator and
   tube placement yesterday.  Respiratory status also complicated by
   possible underlying COPD given smoking history with possible air
   stacking/trapping, possible VAP or other pulmonary infection, pulm
   edema as she required lots of fluids for hypotension,
   atelectasis/consolidation seen at bilateral bases.  PTX not seen on
   CXR. Also with b/l pleural effusions seen on CT although tumor has
   decreased.
   -Vent: decrease tidal volumes as PIP high
   -Decrease FiO2 as tolerated
   -ABG to reassess oxygenation on new vent settings; goal pH > 7.2
   (7.2-7.24) with goal PaO2 >60.
   - holding vanc (for MRSA) as her level is elevated (therapeutic today);
   will check level in AM and readjust dose as needed
 continue holding
   today (d1 = [**2172-8-31**]; 8 day course)
   - continue cefepime and Cipro to cover pseudomonas VAP (Day 1= [**2172-8-31**];
   8 day course)
   - chest tube to stay in place as per IP recs until patient is off vent
   - s/p 3 days of chemotherapy; scheduled for formal planning for XRT
   early next week (approx [**2172-9-8**])
   - f/u speciation of sputum cx; BAL results
   -bladder pressure [**Hospital1 **]
   -Possible bronch to evaluate tube placement
   -Goals of care (see below)
   .
   # Altered Mental Status: Patient has been off propofol >72h and still
   not moving extremities or grossly following commands. Most likley toxic
   metabolic encephalopathy as pt is uremic. Differential includes seizure
   although EEG does not demonstrate seizure activity. LP does not
   demonstrate infection or spread of malignancy. CT head negative for
   acute process.
   - f/u  CSF studies
   -Will defer neuro consult at this time as it will most likely not
   change management
   .
   # Acute Renal failure: Pt now anuric. In setting of chemo with
   carboplatin.  Urine casts consistent with ATN.  Plan to optimize SBP
   120s-130s but pt with hypotension. Now unable to give fluids as pt is
   volume overloaded, contributing to hypoxia.  Also, increased uric acid
   suggests possible TLS although usually seen 1-2d after chemo for SCC,
   here seen 4-5d post chemo.
   - trend Cr and renally dose meds
   - continue to hold vanc as level too elevated
   .
   #. Metabolic acidosis: Now with respiratory and metabolic acidosis.
   Received HCO3 last night so pH improved. Realize this is now a gap
   metabolic acidosis as her albumin is low.  Her metabolic acidosis is
   likely related to uremia.  Unable to increase RR due to concern for
   autopeeping in setting of possible COPD. Goal pH is 7.2-7.24.
   - will f/u endo and renal recs
   - If pH continues to decrease below 7.2, unable to give more HCO3 as it
   requires much fluid and pt is fluid overloaded.
   .
   # Tachycardia/Hypotension with new [**Name (NI) 7929**]
 Pt with continued
   tachycardia and episodes of hypotension. EKG demonstrated new onset
   A-fib. LENIs negative for DVT but unable to assess for PE as pt cannot
   have CTA given renal failure and VQ scan will not be helpful in setting
   of lung pathology. Echo did not show RV strain or enlarging pericardial
   effusion. Per Hem/Onc, no anti-coagulation as tumor may hemorrhage.
   Also may have increased SVC compression with decreased preload.
   -F/u Hem/Onc re: chemo and XRT (currently scheduled for approx [**2172-9-8**])
   -[**Month (only) 11**] do small fluid boluses for hypotension although pt with pulm edema
   until d/w family
   .
   #. Electrolyte disturbances: Hypernatremia resolved after D5W
   administration. Pt had hyponatremia and hyperkalemia on admission, both
   resolved. Unclear etiology of electrolyte disturbances on admission-
   thought to be secondary to possible adrenal insufficency (now
   discarded) or possibly SIADH.  Low UNa does not exclude SIADH; renal
   recommends rechecking urine lytes with saline load, not yet done in
   setting of pt
s other medical issues.  (In SIADH, UNa should increase
   and Uosm should remain high).

   #. Small cell lung carcinoma: per pathology, the tumor probably fits
   into the spectrum of a small cell carcinoma of lung. Given associated
   SVC syndrome, prognosis is likely poor. CT [**Last Name (un) **]/pelvis/head negative
   for metastases.  s/p 3 days of chemo and 2 sessions of XRT.  Initially,
   XRT was clinical emergency - they might've treated lots of nl tissue;
   Pt was to have formal tissue planning session early this week (approx
   [**2172-9-8**]).
   - continue neupogen for 10 day course
 per Hem/Onc, decreased WBC ct
   in setting of neupogen does not bode well.
   - f/u heme/onc recs and rad/onc recs
   - continue neutropenic precautions
   .
   #. SVC syndrome:  Incomplete occlusion of SVC; near complete occlusion
   of brachiocephalic veins. Clinically identified by upper extremity and
   facial swelling/plethora and mottled skin. Seen in appoximately 10%
   cases of SSLC. Improved edema on exam compared to admission. Per
   family, pt did not have SVC syndrome when she came to hospital ([**Hospital Unit Name 10**]
   team thought she had it on presentation to ED). SVC syndrome occurred
   after Y-stent placed. Possible that tumor pushing into trachea shifted
   to compress SVC after stent placement.

   # Sinus Pause on telemetry: Pt had episodes of sinus pauses on tele
   night of [**8-30**]. Had new episodes within last few days, again with
   turning.  Resumed beat is junctional. Cardiology consult thinks it
   vagally mediated.  Pauses decreased in frequency and duration on their
   own without intervention.
   - Care with turning patient
   - continue to hold metoprolol
   - Per cardiology, no need for transcutaneous pacing
   - monitor vitals, HR, hemodynamic instability, no pressors if resumed
   beat is wide complex.
   .
   #Leukopenia/thrombocytopenia
 most likely due to chemotherapy. Pt on
   neupogen with continued decreased counts. Per Onc, this does not bode
   well for prognosis. Low suspicion for HITT.

","Summary:
The patient is a 58-year-old female with a history of small cell carcinoma of the lung (SCC) who is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure, renal failure, and altered mental status. She has a complex medical history, including SVC syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, pericardial effusion, resolved pleural effusion and pneumothorax. The patient is also experiencing hypotension and tachycardia with new onset atrial fibrillation. She has leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypernatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still acidotic due to respiratory and metabolic acidosis, and there is a concern for possible underlying COPD, air trapping, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or other pulmonary infections. The goal is to improve oxygenation and ventilation while avoiding further complications.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has anuria and is volume overloaded, which may contribute to hypoxia. There is a concern for acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). Renal function should be closely monitored, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has been off propofol for over 72 hours and is not moving extremities or following commands. Toxic metabolic encephal"

   Following am rounds, I spoke with pt
s son by phone and updated him as
   to his mother
s condition and continued decline. Explained that we are
   very limited as additional fluids are contributing to worsening
   oxygenation and significant volume overload in setting of progressive
   renal failure.  Without fluids, she is becoming progressively
   hypotensive.  We are now maxing out in terms of ventilator on 100%
   FIO2.   She remains unresponsive off all sedation. Her prognosis for
   recovery remains extremely poor and she is declining despite our
   aggressive attempts.  Pt
s son expressed his full understanding.  All
   of his questions were answered.  At this time he wishes to move toward
   CMO with terminal extubation understanding that his mother will likely
   pass quickly after removal of the ETT.  We will focus fully on her
   comfort with morphine as needed.  His uncle is headed in and he will
   let us know if his uncle wishes to be present at the time of
   extubation.  He and pt
s sisters and other family member spent time at
   bedside yesterday and do not plan to be present.
   Additional 20 minutes crit care time spent in discussion.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 58-year-old female with respiratory failure due to a newly diagnosed lung cancer (likely small cell) caused by superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome, airway compromise requiring Y-stent placement, and pneumonia. The patient has been admitted for radiation therapy and chemotherapy but has shown a progressive clinical decline and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 

The patient's respiratory failure is multifactorial, including malpositioning/migration of endotracheal tube (ETT), extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi, lung mass, underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates concerning for pneumonia (ventilator-associated pneumonia or VAP), and plugging. The patient remains tachycardic in atrial fibrillation (AFib) and hypotensive. 

The patient is unresponsive off sedation and likely toxic from metabolic uremia and infection. Other issues include thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia, hypernatremia (resolved), acute renal failure (ARF), and decreased level of consciousness.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Continue aggressive care in the ICU.
2. Stop fluids and compensate as able with ventilation.
3. Check bladder pressures for compartment syndrome.
4. Dialysis would further prolong the patient's course and is unlikely to change"

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, small cell lung cancer, airway collapse, right pleural effusion, SVC syndrome, right pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), altered mental status, tachycardia, hypotension, acute kidney injury (ARF), thrombocytopenia, hypernatremia, and pancytopenia.

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube in place. There are concerns about malpositioning/migration of the ETT, extrinsic and intrinsic narrowing of the distal trachea and bronchi, lung mass, underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and right lower lobe (RLL) and left lower lobe (LLL) infiltrates concerning for pneumonia.

The patient's respiratory status is complicated by volume overload, higher FiO2 requirements, and higher pressures. The patient's abdomen is tense, and she is nearly anuric. The patient is also showing signs of multiorgan dysfunction, including renal failure and hepatic dysfunction.
