   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected (culture
   pending).  Given her evolving picture and pending cultures, will
   continue to cover broadly.
   - vanc, zosyn, levo, and flagyl (restarted)
   - send sputum and C. Diff cultures
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - f/u cultures
   - surveillance BCx
   - tailor antibiotics per sensitivities
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and was not
   adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Now has received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer requires pressors.
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   - levophed prn when CVP < 10.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.
   - cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - unlikely to be underlying central process given normal head CT.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.7, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission.  Likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis.
   Creatinine and urine output improved with volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - cont. IVF to maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Patient has lower hct and plt this morning in
   association with an elevated INR and PTT (patient not on a heparin
   drip, LMW heparin, or warfarin).
   - LFTs added on to AM labs
   - stop sc heparin tid
   - hemolysis labs pending
   - transfuse 1 unit with follow-up BCB and lytes afterward
   - peripheral smear evaluation for DIC vs. HUS/TTP
   .
   # Sedation: Fentanyl and versed to help keep patient comfortable while
   intubated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO yesterday (>55%).  Does have severe
   diastolic dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has
   resolved.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  ROMI
d with 3 sets of
   cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # history of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now, may add in home glargine.
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.  Will consider dermatology consult given unusual bullous nature
   of lesions.
   .
   # CAD/hx of stroke: on ASA
   .
   # HTN: holding antihypertensives

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dementia. She was admitted with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The initial assessment indicates that the patient may be experiencing sepsis, possibly due to a urinary source or pneumonia. The patient has received broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), levofloxacin, and metronidazole.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 111 bpm and low blood pressure ranging from 72-153 mmHg. She is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 350-450 mL and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. The respiratory support indicates possible acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), although the lung compliance is still good.

The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with a peak creatinine level of 2.1 mg/dL, up from her baseline of 1.0-1.4 mg/dL prior to admission. This suggests acute renal failure, likely secondary to hypotension and underlying sepsis.

Other findings in the note include severe diastolic dysfunction, concerns for disseminated intravascular coagulation ("

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dementia. The patient presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

Assessment and plan:
1. Sepsis: The patient is diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to urosepsis, given her hypothermia and leukopenia. Other potential sources of infection include aspiration pneumonia and infection of foot ulcers. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated to cover gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes.
2. Congestive heart failure (CHF): The patient has a known reduced ejection fraction (20%) and pulmonary edema as evidenced by a chest X-ray. After resolving the septic picture, diuresis will be considered.
3. Possible pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient has been started on heparin due to concern for PE, but it has been temporarily discontinued for central line placement. Restarting heparin until a computed tomography angiography (CTA) can be done is being considered.
4. Chest pain: The etiology of the chest pain is unclear, but it may be related to a PE. Further evaluation, including checking cardiac enzymes, is recommended.
5. History of seizure: A recent seizure occurred, possibly related to a past stroke. Continuing kepp"

   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected (culture
   pending).  Given her evolving picture and pending cultures, will
   continue to cover broadly.

   - send sputum and C. Diff cultures
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65

   # Hypotension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and was not
   adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Now has received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer requires pressors.
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   - levophed prn when CVP < 10.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.
   - cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - unlikely to be underlying central process given normal head CT.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.7, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission.  Likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis.
   Creatinine and urine output improved with volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - cont. IVF to maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Patient has lower hct and plt this morning in
   association with an elevated INR and PTT (patient not on a heparin
   drip, LMW heparin, or warfarin).
   - LFTs added on to AM labs
   - stop sc heparin tid
   - hemolysis labs pending
   - transfuse 1 unit with follow-up BCB and lytes afterward
   - peripheral smear evaluation for DIC vs. HUS/TTP
   .
   # Sedation: Fentanyl and versed to help keep patient comfortable while
   intubated.

   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected (culture
   pending).  Given her evolving picture and pending cultures, will
   continue to cover broadly.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still
   pending.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levo, discontinued the flagyl
   - Brochoscopy today, with cultures, gram stain, and cell counts.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and was not
   adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Now has received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer requires pressors.
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Attempt diuresis with 20mg of IV lasix
 if she urinates large
   volumes, she is likely ready for diuresis in the setting of 12 L worth
   of fluid resuscitation; if, however, she does not urinate large volumes
   and her Cr increases, she would not be ready for said diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.6, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission.  Likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis.
   Creatinine and urine output improved with volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - cont. IVF to maintain CVP > 10
 treating supportively.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Patient has lower hct and plt this morning in
   association with an elevated INR and PTT (patient not on a heparin
   drip, LMW heparin, or warfarin).
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs, including following DIC labs.
   .
   # Sedation: Fentanyl and versed to help keep patient comfortable while
   intubated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO yesterday (>55%).  Does have severe
   diastolic dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has
   resolved.
   - Will attempt to diurese per the plan above.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted hypothermic, leukopenic, and with low oxygen saturation. She also presented with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient's condition has been complicated by sepsis, hypotension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, question of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sedation, congestive heart failure (CHF), possible pulmonary embolism (PE), chest pain, history of seizure, diabetes mellitus (DM), foot ulcers/bullae, coronary artery disease/stroke, hypertension, and prior procedures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, elevated lactate, and metabolic acidosis are concerning for sepsis. It is important to continue broad antibiotic coverage until culture results are available.
2. Hypotension: The patient initially had a low central venous pressure (CVP) and required volume resuscitation. Maintaining a CVP > 10 is recommended to prevent further hypotension.
3. Respiratory Failure: The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it is likely related to sepsis and may have an underlying pneumonia. There is also a concern for potential acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like picture. Close monitoring and consideration of switching to volume-cycled assist"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2 saturation and urinary tract infection symptoms. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 101.1, blood pressure of 162/63 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Fluid balance shows a deficit of 180 mL. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. Blood cultures have been negative so far. The patient is being treated for sepsis with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and other potential causes such as pneumonia and acute renal failure are also being considered.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings suggest sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread inflammation caused by infection. It can lead to organ dysfunction and failure if not promptly treated.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate impaired kidney function, which may be due to hypotension, underlying sepsis, or diuresis. This can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acidosis, and the accumulation of waste products in the body.
3. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation"

   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing.  Given her
   evolving picture and pending cultures, will continue to cover broadly.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still

   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Attempt diuresis with 20mg of IV lasix
 if she urinates large
   volumes, she is likely ready for diuresis in the setting of 12 L worth
   of fluid resuscitation; if, however, she does not urinate large volumes
   and her Cr increases, she would not be ready for said diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.6, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected (culture
   pending).  Given her evolving picture and pending cultures, will
   continue to cover broadly.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still
   pending.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levo, discontinued the flagyl
   - Brochoscopy today, with cultures, gram stain, and cell counts.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and was not
   adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Now has received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer requires pressors.
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Attempt diuresis with 20mg of IV lasix
 if she urinates large
   volumes, she is likely ready for diuresis in the setting of 12 L worth
   of fluid resuscitation; if, however, she does not urinate large volumes
   and her Cr increases, she would not be ready for said diuresis.
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.6, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission.  Likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis.
   Creatinine and urine output improved with volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - cont. IVF to maintain CVP > 10
 treating supportively.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Patient has lower hct and plt this morning in
   association with an elevated INR and PTT (patient not on a heparin
   drip, LMW heparin, or warfarin).
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs, including following DIC labs.
   .
   # Sedation: Fentanyl and versed to help keep patient comfortable while
   intubated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO yesterday (>55%).  Does have severe
   diastolic dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has
   resolved.
   - Will attempt to diurese per the plan above.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now, may add in home glargine.
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.  Will consider dermatology consult given unusual bullous nature
   of lesions.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2 saturation and urinary tract infection symptoms. The patient's condition is concerning for sepsis, with negative urine and blood cultures, suggesting possible urosepsis or pneumonia. She has been receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics coverage.

The patient's hypotension was initially not adequately volume-resuscitated, but she has now received sufficient volume overnight and no longer requires pressors. Her central venous pressure (CVP) goal is >10.

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, likely related to sepsis and may have an underlying pneumonia. There is concern for potential ARDS-like picture, but her lung compliance is good. Tidal volumes are being used to compensate for her metabolic acidosis.

The patient has acute renal failure, with elevated creatinine levels from 1.0-1.4 to 1.6. This is likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis. Creatinine and urine output improved with volume resuscitation. The goal is to maintain CVP > 10.

There is a question of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), with lower hematocrit and platelet count, elevated INR and PTT. Heparin is remaining off due to the concern for DIC.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing.  Given her
   evolving picture and pending cultures, will continue to cover broadly.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still
   pending.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levo, discontinued the flagyl
   - Resend stool for C. diff
   - CT abd & pelvis today with PO contrast but no IV contrast given ARF
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and
   was not adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer required pressors.  Now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Restart metoprolol and amlodipine at home doses, watch BP
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory status has
   improved.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today with goal of extubating if possible
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.9, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and up from 1.6 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension and
   underlying sepsis and diuresis yesterday.  Urine output improved with
   volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - no lasix today
   - No IVF unless BP & urine output drop.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs, including following DIC labs.
   .
   # Sedation: Fentanyl and versed to help keep patient comfortable while
   intubated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO yesterday (>55%).  Does have severe
   diastolic dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has
   resolved.
   - Will hold diuresis today per the plan above.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now, may add in home glargine.
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.  Will consider dermatology consult given unusual bullous nature
   of lesions.
   .
   # CAD/hx of stroke: on ASA
   .
   # HTN: holding antihypertensives
   .
   # PPx: ranitidine, bowel regimen, scd

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection. The initial assessment suggests sepsis, but no clear source has been identified yet. The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires mechanical ventilation. Her renal function has deteriorated, likely due to hypotension and underlying sepsis. The patient's blood cultures have been negative, and she has received broad-spectrum antibiotics. Other potential complications include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute renal failure, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). The patient also has a history of seizures, foot ulcers, and coronary artery disease. She is currently on sedation with fentanyl and versed, and her blood pressure is being managed with metoprolol and amlodipine. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient presents with signs of sepsis, including hypothermia, leukopenia, metabolic acidosis, and bandemia. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, no clear source of infection has been identified yet. The patient's evolving clinical picture indicates ongoing sepsis, and further investigations are needed to identify the source of infection.

   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative.  Most likely is urosepsis
   given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry was
   consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing.  Given her
   evolving picture and pending cultures, will continue to cover broadly.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures

s CVP was 7 following admission and
   was not adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer required pressors.  Now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Restart metoprolol and amlodipine at home doses, watch BP
   - Maintain CVP > 10

   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory status has
   improved.

   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.9, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and up from 1.6 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension and
   underlying sepsis and diuresis yesterday.  Urine output improved with
   volume resusciatation.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - no lasix today
   - No IVF unless BP & urine output drop.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2 saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI). She has been diagnosed with sepsis, likely due to urosepsis or pneumonia, and is currently being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Her blood cultures have consistently been negative, and she has shown improvement in her respiratory status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's symptoms, including hypothermia, leukopenia, metabolic acidosis, large IV fluid requirement, and bandemia, suggest sepsis. However, no clear source has been identified yet, making it challenging to treat effectively.

2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient initially had low central venous pressure (CVP) and required fluid resuscitation. Now, she is hypertensive, possibly due to her home medications for hypertension (amlodipine, metoprolol, and HCTZ). It is essential to monitor and manage her blood pressure while maintaining adequate CVP.

3. Respiratory Failure: The etiology of her respiratory failure is unclear, but it is likely related to sepsis and may have an underlying pneumonia. She may also have an ARDS-like picture, but her lung compliance remains good. If her respiratory status worsens, volume-cycled assist control ventilation may"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 62F severe diastolic diastolic dysfunction,
   DM, BKA, CKD, seizures, dementia found with hypoglycemia, hypothermia,
   ARF, and probable UTI c/b septic shock.
   Exam notable for Tm 101.1  Tc 98.7 BP 141/48-196/80 HR 65-107 CVP 12
   RR 9-29 with sat 90's on PSV 10/8, Fio2 0.5, RSBI 46  PERRL, opens
   eyes, tracks, but does not follow commands. Decreased BS with  rales B
   bases. RRR 2/6Sm. Soft, no tenderness, + BS. 1+ edema; well healed R
   BKA, L foot stable. Labs notable for WBC 9K, HCT 25.9, Na 144, K+ 3.7,
   Cr 1.8,
   No new CXR today
   62F DCM, DM, CKD p/w UTI c/b septic shock and MOSF (resp failure,
   shock, ARF, DIC).
   Improving from sepsis standpoint though remains without clear source.
   Agree with plan to continue broad antibiotics (vanco/zosyn/levo) and
   follow up cultures including c. diff; likely GNR/urosepsis, severe CAP
   or aspiration. Neg CT abd and pelvic.   BP better controlled with
   hydral and BB-->titrate doses. Continue PSV with slow wean back to
   [**4-15**] and recheck RSBI / SBT in am. Mental status is improving following
   episode of hypoglycemia. Will continue to hold sedation and monitor
   with serial exams. Cr stable, but elevated above baseline.  Suspect
   ATN. Continue renal dosing of meds. Goal net even
 will give gentle
   lasix if needed for u/o.  Hct and plts improving, Continue to follow
   dic labs (though picture does not appear c/w DIC). Continue TFs. Wound
   care for LLE. Remainder of plan as outlined above.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, dementia, and chronic kidney disease. She presented with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, most likely due to urosepsis given the presence of pyuria on admission. There is also a concern for pneumonia, but no clear source of infection has been identified. The patient's blood cultures are negative for bacteria, and her urine culture is pending. 

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with initial hypotension and now hypertension. She requires close monitoring and management of her blood pressure. 

The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 451 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. Her respiratory status has improved, and she is expected to undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today with the goal of extubation if possible. 

The patient's renal function has worsened, with an elevated creatinine level from 1.0-1.4 to 1.9. This is likely related to hypotension and underlying sepsis. 

There are concerns about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but the patient's laboratory results do not strongly"

   Micro: urine & BAL + yeast; blood cultures & C. Diff negative.
   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative for bacteria.  Most likely is
   urosepsis given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing.  Given her
   evolving picture and pending cultures, will continue to cover broadly.
   CT abd & pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still
   pending.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levo, discontinued the flagyl
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and
   was not adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer required pressors.  Now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Metoprolol and amlodipine restarted at home doses
   - Hydralazine added and will uptitrate for better BP control
   - Continue to hold enalapril & HCTZ
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory status has
   improved.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today with goal of extubating if possible
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.9, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and steady from 1.8 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension
   and underlying sepsis.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - attempt to maintain fluid status net even to slightly negative but
   avoid aggressive diuresis
   - No IVF unless BP & urine output drop.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.    Hct &
   plt trending upward.  DIC labs may be elevated today secondary to
   inflammation.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   .
   # Sedation: Low dose fentanyl and versed to help keep patient
   comfortable while intubated.  Patient
s daughter requests minimum
   sedation possible.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has resolved.
   - Will hold diuresis per the plan above.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now, may add in home glargine.
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.  Will consider dermatology consult given unusual bullous nature
   of lesions.
   .
   # CAD/hx of stroke: on ASA
   .
   # HTN: see above

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (today is [**5-21**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Metoprolol and amlodipine restarted at home doses
   - Hydralazine added and uptitrated for better BP control
   - will try to diurese with Lasix and increase Metoprolol to 50 PO BID
   today.
   - can consider restarting Enalapril and/or HCTZ tomorrow given improved
   renal function.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - will reassess with SBT tomorrow and possible extubation
   - try to diurese today with goal
 1L and monitor PM lytes
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.6 up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and steady from 1.8 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension
   and underlying sepsis.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - attempt diurese today with goal -1L today, monitor PM lytes and
   creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.    Hct &
   plt trending upward.  DIC labs may be elevated today secondary to
   inflammation. Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and HCT is stable.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - f/u DIC labs unchanged
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Will start diuresis per the plan above.
   - ASA

   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a medical history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dementia. The patient presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygenation and urinary tract infection (UTI). 

The assessment and plan include the following potential medical complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a systemic response to infection. The source of infection is not clear at this point, but cultures have been negative. The fever curve is trending down, and the patient is no longer hypotensive. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been continued for a total course of 10 days.

2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive and required fluids and pressors. Now the patient is hypertensive. She is already on medication for hypertension at home, including amlodipine, enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ. The plan is to restart metoprolol and amlodipine at home doses, add hydralazine for better BP control, try to diurese with Lasix, and increase metoprolol to 50 PO BID today. Considering the improved renal function, restarting enalapril and/or HCTZ may be considered tomorrow.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with multiple comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), dementia, and a below-knee amputation (BKA). She was admitted to the ICU with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI). The initial assessment revealed sepsis, likely related to UTI, with negative cultures. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and levofloxacin.

Subsequently, the patient developed hypotension and required fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support. She was also found to have acute renal failure (ARF) with an elevated creatinine level. The source of infection was not clear, and extensive workup, including bronchoscopy and abdominal/pelvic CT scan, did not reveal any specific source. DIC was considered but ruled out.

The patient's respiratory status improved, and she was weaned off mechanical ventilation. However, she failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) due to desaturation. Her blood pressure remains difficult to control despite multiple antihypertensive medications. The plan includes continuing broad-spectrum antibiotics, optimizing blood pressure control, diuresis, and close monitoring of renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: Patient
s hypothermia on presentation, elevated lactate,
   metabolic acidosis, large IVF requirement, and bandemia are all
   concerning for sepsis, however, no clear source as of yet as urine and
   blood cultures are consistently negative for bacteria.  Most likely is
   urosepsis given pyuria on admission vs. pneumonia in lungs.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing.  Given her
   evolving picture and pending cultures, will continue to cover broadly.
   CT abd & pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - CVP goal > 10
   - MAP goal > 65
   - F/u cultures
   - Surveillance BCx to send.
   - Tailor antibiotics per sensitivities, many of which are still
   pending.
   - Vanc, zosyn, levo, discontinued the flagyl
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Patient
s CVP was 7 following admission and
   was not adequately volume resuscitated initially.  Received sufficient
   volume overnight and no longer required pressors.  Now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Metoprolol and amlodipine restarted at home doses
   - Hydralazine added and will uptitrate for better BP control
   - Continue to hold enalapril & HCTZ
   - Maintain CVP > 10
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung
   compliance.  If clinically worsens or changes may consider switching to
   volume-cycled assist control 350-380 at 22-25 to keep tidal volumes
   lower.  Patient currently has large tidal volumes, likely to help
   compensate for her metabolic acidosis.  Respiratory status has
   improved.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - Spontaneous breathing trial today with goal of extubating if possible
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.9, up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and steady from 1.8 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension
   and underlying sepsis.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - attempt to maintain fluid status net even to slightly negative but
   avoid aggressive diuresis
   - No IVF unless BP & urine output drop.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.    Hct &
   plt trending upward.  DIC labs may be elevated today secondary to
   inflammation.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   .
   # Sedation: Low dose fentanyl and versed to help keep patient
   comfortable while intubated.  Patient
s daughter requests minimum
   sedation possible.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.  [**Month (only) 11**] be able to diurese after septic picture has resolved.
   - Will hold diuresis per the plan above.
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), dementia, who presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2 saturation and urinary tract infection (UTI). She is currently intubated in the ICU due to respiratory failure of unclear etiology, likely related to sepsis and potential pneumonia. The patient's CVP was initially low but has been adequately volume resuscitated. She is now hypertensive and requires titration of hydralazine for better blood pressure control. The patient's renal function has deteriorated from a baseline creatinine level of 1.0-1.4 to 1.9, suggesting acute renal failure possibly related to hypotension and underlying sepsis. There are concerns about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it seems unlikely. The patient's condition requires careful monitoring and management of various medical complications, including sepsis, hypotension/hypertension, respiratory failure, acute renal failure, and potential pulmonary embolism (PE). Other issues include a history of seizure, diabetes mellitus, foot ulcers/bullae, CAD/hx of stroke, and hypertension. The patient's family has been informed about the situation and the plan for her care."

   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function; check vanc trough
   - discuss with podiatry whether they think the foot is just colonized
   or infected
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Pt. is now somewhat bradycardic today.
   - Decrease metoprolol from 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - can consider restarting Enalapril and/or HCTZ tomorrow given improved
   renal function if BP is elevated.

   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.

   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward again, though FDP normal today.  Pt has no
   clear bleeding or hemolysis and HCT is stable.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history, and the current clinical findings, there are several potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status has been concerning, with the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The presence of diffuse alveolar edema on imaging suggests ARDS, which is a serious lung condition that can develop due to sepsis or other underlying causes.

2. Sepsis: The patient's presentation includes fever, hypotension, and leukopenia, indicating a systemic infection. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, the source of sepsis remains unclear. Monitoring for any signs of worsening sepsis is crucial.

3. Hypertension/Bradycardia: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, initially requiring fluids and vasopressors, but now presenting with hypertension. Adjustments in antihypertensive medications may be necessary, considering the patient's renal function and overall clinical stability.

4. Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels have been elevated, indicating acute kidney injury. Close monitoring of renal function, fluid balance, and medication dosing adjustments are essential to prevent further deterioration.

5. Possible Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's lab results show a decreasing platelet count, prolonged PTT, and elevated D-dimer levels, raising concerns for DIC. However, other diagnostic criteria"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (today is [**5-21**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.
   - Metoprolol and amlodipine restarted at home doses
   - Hydralazine added and uptitrated for better BP control
   - will try to diurese with Lasix and increase Metoprolol to 50 PO BID
   today.
   - can consider restarting Enalapril and/or HCTZ tomorrow given improved
   renal function.
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - will reassess with SBT tomorrow and possible extubation
   - try to diurese today with goal
 1L and monitor PM lytes
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now 1.6 up from baseline of 1.0-1.4 prior to
   admission and steady from 1.8 yesterday.  Likely related to hypotension
   and underlying sepsis.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - attempt diurese today with goal -1L today, monitor PM lytes and
   creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.    Hct &
   plt trending upward.  DIC labs may be elevated today secondary to
   inflammation. Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and HCT is stable.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - f/u DIC labs unchanged
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Will start diuresis per the plan above.
   - ASA
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now, may add in home glargine.
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.
   .
   # CAD/hx of stroke: on ASA
   .
   # HTN: see above
   .
   # PPx: ranitidine, bowel regimen, scd

   Assessment and Plan
   62 yo female admitted with sepsis related to urinary tract infection
   and now in ICU with persistent ventilatory failure with re-intubation
   with hypoxemic respiratory failure.
   1)Respiratory Failure
   -Versed
   -Continue with A/C support with lung protective stragegy
   -Patient with non-hydrostatic edema contributing and will continue to
   move to diuresis as possible.
   -Move to negative fluid balance as tolerated but patient with some
   intra-vascular depletion with CVP=2 and 1000cc negative yesterday
   2)Pneumonia-Possible aspiration but pattern is not classic for
   bacterial pneumonia
   -Vanco/Zosyn/Levofloxacin
   -Aspiration is a concern as possible source so will have to continue
   with reasonable broad spectrum antibiotic support
   -Encouraging decrease in WBC count
   3)Foot Ulcer-
   -Wound care to continue
   -Will need podiatry eval for any worsening
   -Antibiotic treatment to be driven by concern for systemic insult from
   foot
   Hypertension-
   -Decrease beta-blockers with decrease in HR
   -Will need to continue with anit-hypertensives
   Thrombocytopenia-
   -In part likely related to Sepsis and no evidence of DIC
   -Heparin held and some improvement in PLT count prior to restart

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 62-year-old female who was admitted with sepsis related to a urinary tract infection and is now in the ICU with persistent ventilatory failure requiring re-intubation. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation and is experiencing hypoxemic respiratory failure. There are concerns about possible pneumonia, possibly due to aspiration, as well as a foot ulcer that may be contributing to systemic infection. The patient also has hypertension, thrombocytopenia, and a history of diabetes mellitus type I.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent ventilatory failure and re-intubation indicate a high risk of respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring and management of the patient's respiratory status are crucial.
2. Pneumonia: The possibility of pneumonia, potentially caused by aspiration, needs to be closely monitored and treated promptly to prevent further complications.
3. Foot Ulcer: The presence of a foot ulcer increases the risk of infection spreading systemically. Close wound care and evaluation by a podiatrist are necessary to prevent worsening of the condition.
4. Hypertension: The patient's hypertension requires ongoing management to prevent complications associated with high blood pressure.
5. Thrombocytopenia: The low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitoring and appropriate management are essential to prevent bleeding complications.
6. Delirium/Confusion: Given the patient's critical condition and prolonged sedation, there is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function; check vanc trough
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Pt. is now somewhat bradycardic today.
   - Decrease metoprolol from 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Enalapril restarted, can titrate up for optimal BP control
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - will reassess with SBT tomorrow and possible extubation
   - place on ARDSnet protocol
   - diurese with Lasix gtt
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.4.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward.  Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and
   HCT is stable.  SC heparin stopped.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - check HIT panel
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Lasix gtt
   - ASA
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.

   # DM: SSI for now, will decrease home glargine given hypoglycemia
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care

The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygen saturation and urinary tract infection. The initial assessment indicates sepsis with no clear source, negative cultures, and a fever curve trending down. The patient is no longer hypotensive and does not have an infection in her left foot according to podiatry consultation. Bronchoscopy and CT abdomen/pelvis did not reveal any sources of infection.

The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring fluids and pressors initially, but now she is hypertensive. She has a history of hypertension at home and takes medications including amlodipine, enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ. Metoprolol and amlodipine were restarted at home doses, and hydralazine was added for better blood pressure control. The patient is also bradycardic today.

Respiratory failure is still present, possibly related to sepsis and underlying pneumonia. There is a concern for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the patient's lung compliance remains good. The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she is close to extubation, although she failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. Broad antibiotic coverage will continue pending microbiology results. She will be reassessed tomorrow for another SBT and possible"

   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function; check vanc trough
   - discuss with podiatry whether they think the foot is just colonized
   or infected
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Pt. is now somewhat bradycardic today.
   - Decrease metoprolol from 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - can consider restarting Enalapril and/or HCTZ tomorrow given improved
   renal function if BP is elevated.

   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - will reassess with SBT tomorrow and possible extubation
   - place on ARDSnet protocol
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.6.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   - as urine output is down despite normal to elevated BP will bolus with
   250 cc and monitor response.
   - hold on diurese today pending fluid bolus trial.
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward again, though FDP normal today.  Pt has no
   clear bleeding or hemolysis and HCT is stable.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - stop heparin sc
   - check HIT panel

   # Sedation: No longer sedated.

   dysfunction.
   - Will start diuresis per the plan above.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She presented with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection. She was found to have sepsis but with no clear source of infection. Her blood cultures were negative. She also had hypotension initially but is now hypertensive. She required fluids and vasopressors for blood pressure control. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her renal function is improving, but she has acute kidney injury. There is a concern for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but it is not confirmed. She has a history of seizures, diabetes mellitus, foot ulcers, and coronary artery disease with previous stroke. Her current medications include metoprolol, enalapril, HCTZ, amlodipine, glargine, and levofoxacin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, there was no clear source of infection identified. The sepsis curve is trending down, indicating improvement.
2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive and required fluids and vasopressors for blood pressure control. Now she is hypertensive, which may be"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female admitted with sepsis and respiratory failure. She required re-intubation due to non-hydrostatic pulmonary edema, possibly exacerbated by mild aspiration during the intubation process. The patient has been weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) and is being considered for extubation with PSV and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). She is currently receiving intravenous (IV) medications including vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn), and levofloxacin for broad-spectrum coverage. The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and her thrombocytopenia does not show evidence of new thrombosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status should be closely monitored, as there is a risk of recurrence or worsening of respiratory failure, particularly during extubation and weaning from mechanical ventilation.

2. Sepsis: The patient's sepsis requires ongoing management with appropriate antibiotic therapy and monitoring of vital signs and organ function. There is a risk of progression to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

3. Acute renal failure: The patient's renal function should continue to be monitored, as there is a risk of further deterioration or development of chronic kidney disease. Dose adjustments of medications may be necessary based on renal function.

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**])
   - dose meds for changing renal function; check vanc trough
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Pt. is now somewhat bradycardic today.
   - Decrease metoprolol from 50 [**Hospital1 **] to 25 [**Hospital1 **]
   - Enalapril restarted, can titrate up for optimal BP control
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and pt is close to extubation although
   failed SBT today.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage pending micro results
   - will reassess with SBT tomorrow and possible extubation
   - place on ARDSnet protocol
   - diurese with Lasix gtt
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.4.
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward.  Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and
   HCT is stable.  SC heparin stopped.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - f/u DIC labs
   - check HIT panel
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Lasix gtt
   - ASA
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygen saturation and a urinary tract infection.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:

1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. The note mentions that the source of infection is unclear and that cultures have been negative so far. It is important to continue broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage to prevent further complications related to sepsis.

2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive on admission but is now hypertensive. This fluctuation in blood pressure should be managed carefully to prevent complications such as organ damage or increased cardiovascular risk.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is improving, but the etiology of respiratory failure is unclear. It is likely related to sepsis and may have an underlying pneumonia. The concern for ARDS-like picture should be monitored closely. The patient is close to extubation but failed a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today. Continuous broad antibiotic coverage is necessary until microbiological results are available.

4. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine levels were elevated on admission and peaked at 2.1 yesterday before returning to 1.4. This indicates acute renal failure"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2 saturation and urinary tract infection (UTI). The patient was initially hypotensive but is now hypertensive. She has been on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, but no clear source of infection has been identified. The patient's respiratory status has improved, and she is expected to be extubated soon. However, there are concerns about flash pulmonary edema, and she may need labetalol IV to manage her blood pressure. The patient also has acute renal failure with a peak creatinine level of 2.1, which has now decreased to 1.3. Her platelet count is trending downward, but there are no signs of bleeding or hemolysis. The question of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is being considered, but it is likely not present. The patient's cardiac function is normal, but she has severe diastolic dysfunction. She may have a possible pulmonary embolism (PE), but further testing has been deferred due to worsening renal failure and concern for sepsis.

   62 yo female wtih initial intubation in the setting of sepsis and with
   hospital course complicated by recurrent hypoxemia and respiratory
   failure.  This has been primarily attribuitable to non hydrostatic
   edema.  Over pas 24 hours patient has had evolution of significant
   diuresis and improved altertness and quite favorable RSBI and tolerance
   of SBT,
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Patient with persistent infiltrates on CXR but substantial improvement
   in mental status, pulmonary compliance and no evidence of recurrence of
   pulmonary edema
   -Extubation today
   -CPAP if needed post extubation
   -Control of rate x pressure product post extubation will be essential
   to success
   Sepsis-
   -Zosyn/Vanco/Levofloxacin to continue for 14 day course
   -Continue diuresis today
   Hypertension-
   -Enalapril/Lopressor given this morning
   -IV as needed to control BP and would favor labetolol
   -Renal failure is improving in the setting of diuresis but would avoid
   nitroprusside if needed

","The patient is a 62-year-old female who was initially intubated due to sepsis and has had a hospital course complicated by recurrent hypoxemia and respiratory failure, primarily attributed to non-hydrostatic edema. Over the past 24 hours, the patient has had significant diuresis and improved alertness, with a favorable respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) and tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials. 

The patient's current condition includes persistent infiltrates on chest X-ray but substantial improvement in mental status, pulmonary compliance, and no evidence of recurrence of pulmonary edema. The plan is to extubate the patient today and provide CPAP if needed post-extubation. Control of rate-pressure product post-extubation will be essential for success. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension, benign; diarrhea; acute respiratory failure (not ARDS); pain control (acute and chronic); acute renal failure (ARF); impaired skin integrity; delirium/confusion; diabetes mellitus type I; sepsis without organ dysfunction; hypoglycemia; hypothermia; hypoxemia; urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient is currently receiving the following ICU care: nutrition, glycemic control, arterial line, multi-lumen line, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), stress ulcer prevention with an H2 blocker, and elevation of head of bed (HOB), mouth care"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**]) today is day 8.
   - vanc trough this AM was 28.0; however dosing should be at 8am and
   trough drawn at 4:30am
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Metoprolol was decreased to 25mg PO BID, then increased to
   25mg PO TID.  Pt was bradycardic at times.
   - Enalapril restarted and will titrate up to 10mg TID for optimal BP
   control
   - continue Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Amlodipine
   - continue Lasix as tolerated by BP
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and will likely be extubated but may
   experience flash pulmonary edema and may need Labetolol IV to reduce
   BP.  On lasix.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage
   - extubation today with Labetolol IV PRN if pt becomes hypertensive and
   concerns for flash pulmonary edema
   - diurese with Lasix gtt today
 currently negative 1.8L with improving
   creatinine.  Will continue at current dosing as tolerated by BP and
   check lytes at noon and 6pm
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.3
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward.  Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and
   HCT is stable.  SC heparin stopped.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - HIT panel pending
   - continue to hold heparin products and trend platelets and HCT
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Lasix gtt
   - ASA
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.
   - cont keppra
   .
   # DM: SSI for now
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.

   .
   # FEN: holding tube feeds pending extubation; may restart diet with
   sips, clears and advance pending extubation today.  Diurese today at
   current lasix gtt dose and monitor electrolytes and creatinine.
   .
   # Access: A-line & IJ.  Will plan for PICC line tomorrow once extubated
   and more stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 62-year-old female with diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia, presented hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygen saturation and urinary tract infection. She required fluids and pressors for hypotension on admission but is now hypertensive. She was extubated and tolerating positive pressure ventilation. A consult for social services was ordered. The patient's diuresis goals were met with a negative fluid balance of 4 liters. An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was scheduled for placement tomorrow, and she was NPO after midnight for the procedure. Enalapril was increased to 7.5 mg due to hypertension overnight in the 160s. The patient's blood glucose level was 66 mg/dL in the morning and was given an ampule of D50. No known drug allergies were reported. The patient received antibiotics including levofloxacin, vancomycin, and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn). She was receiving various infusions and medications in the ICU. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Vital signs and Hemodynamic Monitoring:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F) and 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 69 beats per minute (bpm), blood pressure ranging from 147/58 mmHg to"

   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**]) today is day 8.
   - vanc trough this AM was 28.0; however dosing should be at 8am and
   trough drawn at 4:30am
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Metoprolol was decreased to 25mg PO BID, then increased to
   25mg PO TID.  Pt was bradycardic at times.
   - Enalapril restarted and will titrate up to 10mg TID for optimal BP
   control
   - continue Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Amlodipine
   - continue Lasix as tolerated by BP
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and will likely be extubated but may
   experience flash pulmonary edema and may need Labetolol IV to reduce
   BP.  On lasix.

   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.2
   - cont. to follow creatinine

   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward.  Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and
   HCT is stable.  SC heparin stopped.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 62-year-old female with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted hypothermic, leukopenic, with low oxygen saturation and urinary tract infection symptoms. The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected sepsis, which has since improved. She is no longer hypotensive and has been extubated. Her respiratory status is improving, but there are concerns for potential flash pulmonary edema and underlying pneumonia.

The patient's blood pressure has fluctuated, initially requiring fluids and pressors, now she is hypertensive. She is on multiple antihypertensive medications, including enalapril, amlodipine, and metoprolol, with ongoing titration for optimal blood pressure control.

She experienced acute renal failure with elevated creatinine levels, but this has since improved. The question of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was raised due to declining platelets, but it is likely not present. Her platelet levels are being monitored, and heparin products have been withheld.

There are concerns for congestive heart failure (CHF) due to severe diastolic dysfunction despite a normal ejection fraction on echo. Diuretics have been initiated.

The patient may have experienced a pulmonary embolism (PE), but further investigation has been limited due to worsening renal function and the current picture of sepsis. Heparin was held"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and dementia. She was admitted with hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection. The patient had sepsis with no clear source, negative cultures, and is now improving. She also had hypotension requiring fluids and pressors, but now is hypertensive. She has respiratory failure of unclear etiology, possibly related to sepsis and underlying pneumonia, with concerns for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's acute renal failure is improving, and there are questions about disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Other conditions include sedation, congestive heart failure, possible pulmonary embolism, chest pain, history of seizure, diabetes mellitus, foot ulcers/bullae, coronary artery disease/histroke, hypertension, and previous surgeries.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient initially presented with sepsis, and although the cultures were negative, broad-spectrum antibiotics are being continued for a total course of 10 days.
2. Hypotension/Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive and required fluids and pressors. Now, she is hypertensive, which may need to be managed with antihypertensive medications.
3. Respiratory Failure: The etiology of respiratory failure is unclear, but it may be related to sepsis"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 62 yo female with DM, HTN, CAD, dementia, who presents
   hypothermic, leukopenic, with low O2, and UTI.
   .
   # Sepsis: No clear source at this point with negative cultures.  Fever
   curve is trending down and patient is no longer hypotensive.  Podiatry
   was consulted and does not feel that the left foot is infected, culture
   results thus far underwhelming.  Bronchoscopy not revealing. CT abd &
   pelvis unremarkable for source.
   - continue Vanc, zosyn, levo, for broad-spectrum antibiotics, total
   course 10 days (started [**10-15**]) today is day 8.
   - vanc trough this AM was 28.0; however dosing should be at 8am and
   trough drawn at 4:30am
   .
   # Hypotension/Hypertension: Was hypotensive on admission requiring
   fluids and pressors.  No longer on pressors and now patient is
   hypertensive.  She is hypertensive at home and on amlodipine,
   enalapril, metoprolol, and HCTZ.  Metoprolol and amlodipine were
   restarted at home doses and hydralazine was added for better BP
   control.  Metoprolol was decreased to 25mg PO BID, then increased to
   25mg PO TID.  Pt was bradycardic at times.
   - Enalapril restarted and will titrate up to 10mg TID for optimal BP
   control
   - continue Hydralazine, Metoprolol, Amlodipine
   - continue Lasix as tolerated by BP
   .
   # Respiratory Failure: Etiology unclear, but likely related to sepsis
   and may have an underlying pneumonia.  Also concern for potential
   ARDS-like picture, however, pt. continues to have good lung compliance.
   Respiratory status improving and will likely be extubated but may
   experience flash pulmonary edema and may need Labetolol IV to reduce
   BP.  On lasix.
   - Cont. broad abx coverage
   - extubation today with Labetolol IV PRN if pt becomes hypertensive and
   concerns for flash pulmonary edema
   - diurese with Lasix gtt today
 currently negative 1.8L with improving
   creatinine.  Will continue at current dosing as tolerated by BP and
   check lytes at noon and 6pm
   .
   # Acute Renal Failure: Creatinine elevated to 1.8 on admission, peaked
   at 2.1 yesterday and now back down to 1.2
   - cont. to follow creatinine
   .
   # Question of DIC?: Per heme & repeat labs, likely not DIC.   However,
   plt are trending downward.  Pt has no clear bleeding or hemolysis and
   HCT is stable.  SC heparin stopped.
   - Follow up with Heme/Onc recs.
   - HIT panel pending
   - continue to hold heparin products and trend platelets and HCT
   .
   # Sedation: No longer sedated.
   .
   # CHF: Pt. with normal EF on ECHO (>55%).  Does have severe diastolic
   dysfunction.
   - Lasix gtt
   - ASA
   .
   # ? PE: sent up on heparin out of concern for PE.  Did not do CTA b/c
   of worsening renal failure and picture concerning for sepsis instead of
   PE.  Heparin remaining off given picture concerning for DIC.
   .
   # Chest pain: see 'PE' above.  Unclear history.  R/O
d mi with 3 sets
   of cardiac enzymes.
   .
   # History of seizure: recent seizure reported. etiology unclear, but
   may be related to past stroke.

   # DM: SSI for now
   .
   # Foot ulcers/bullae: Podiatry following, appreciate their wound care
   recs.  They feel that the foot is colonized, but not infected.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 62-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), and dementia. She was admitted to the ICU due to hypothermia, leukopenia, low oxygen saturation, and urinary tract infection (UTI).

The patient has been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for an unclear source of infection. She has shown improvement in her condition, with a decreasing fever curve and no longer requiring vasopressors. However, she is now hypertensive, which was not previously mentioned.

The patient's respiratory status is improving, and she is expected to be extubated soon. There are concerns about potential flash pulmonary edema, and she may need Labetolol IV to reduce blood pressure.

Her renal function has fluctuated, with an initial creatinine level of 1.8, peaking at 2.1, and now back down to 1.2. Acute renal failure is suspected, but further evaluation is needed.

There is also a question of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but the patient does not meet the criteria for this diagnosis. Her platelets are trending downward, and she has no clear bleeding or hemolysis.

The patient has a history of seizure, possibly related to a past stroke. She is currently on keppra for seizure management.

The patient's foot ulcers/bullae are being managed by pod"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-inch tall, 47.8 kg adult who was admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 69 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 136/58 to 147/83 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is currently receiving invasive ventilation support and has undergone arterial line removal.

The patient's fluid balance indicates a total intake of 1,324 mL and a total output of 5,615 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -4,291 mL. The patient's respiratory support consists of PSV/SBT mode on the ventilator, with a tidal volume of 462 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0 cmH2O, fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 6 cmH2O. The patient's blood gases show a pH level of 7.30, indicating respiratory acidosis.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count (WBC) at 143 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hb) at 8.6 g/dL, platelet count (Plt) at 55 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) at 1.4 mg/dL, and lactate level at 2.0 mmol/L. Other lab results are within normal range.

The patient has several ongoing problems including hypertension, respiratory failure, pain control, renal failure, impaired skin integrity, delirium/confusion, sepsis without organ dysfunction, hypoglycemia, hypothermia, hypoxemia, urinary tract infection (UTI), and diabetes mellitus (DM), type I.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory rate is slightly below the expected range, indicating possible respiratory failure. The low PEEP value suggests that the patient may not be receiving adequate ventilatory support.
2. Renal failure: The elevated creatinine level and decreased urine output suggest acute renal failure.
3. Sepsis: The patient's elevated WBC count and lactate level indicate possible sepsis, which could lead to organ dysfunction if not treated promptly.
4. Impaired skin integrity: The negative fluid balance and impaired circulation may contribute to skin breakdown and potential pressure ulcers.
5. Delirium/confusion: The patient's mental status changes suggest delirium or confusion, which can be caused by various factors including sepsis, medications, or organ dysfunction.
6. Hypothermia: The patient's low core temperature indicates hypothermia, which can increase the risk of further complications.
7. Hypoxemia: The patient's oxygen saturation of 99% suggests that they may not be receiving"

   Assessment and Plan
   26 yo female with history of DM, dementia now admit with urosepsis and
   respiratory failure who had recurrent intubation in the setting of
   persistent [**Doctor Last Name 2**] and non-cardiogenic edema.  She now in the setting of
   improved mobilization of fluids has tolerated extubation without event.
   1)Respiratory Failure-
   -Wean O2 as possible
   -OOB to chair
   -Will need suction and chest PT to facilitate secretion clearance
   2)Sepsis-
   -Afebrile overnight
   -Will complete course for urine source of sepsis
   -Excellent diuresis noted over past 24 hours
continue over time with
   negative fluid balance
   -Vanco to continue
   3)HYpertension-
   -Titrate Enalapril for dosing
   -[**Month (only) 11**] need second [**Doctor Last Name 23**] if persistent hypertention seen.

","The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of diabetes mellitus and dementia, admitted with urosepsis and respiratory failure. She had recurrent intubation due to persistent pulmonary edema and non-cardiogenic edema. The patient has now been successfully extubated without any complications.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 62 bpm, blood pressure of 142/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is hemodynamically stable with a sinus rhythm and a central venous pressure of 2 mmHg.

The patient has been receiving intravenous fluids, including dextrose 50%, and various medications such as enalapril for blood pressure control, levofloxacin, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin for sepsis treatment. The patient's fluid balance shows a negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count of 10.5 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 8.6 g/dL, elevated potassium level of 5.5 mEq/L, and slightly elevated lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits.
