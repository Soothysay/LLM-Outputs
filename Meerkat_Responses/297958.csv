   Assessment and Plan
   46 yo M w/ vasculopathy, ESRD and GIB w/ hyperkalemia
   #GIB: Hct dropped 7 points since yesterday. Could all be due to diffuse
   bruising and hematochezia. Given elevated potassium would consider
   intermittent upper GIB as the source vs. hemolysis. Pt. has antibodies
   to blood products from 2 failed transplants, will need special blood
   from blood bank. INR therapeutic, but likely causing bleeding.
   - Transfuse when blood ready
   - FFP
   - Hold warfarin
   - f/u vascular surgery, reconsider necessity of warfarin
   - check haptoglobin/LDH/bili
   - Appreciate GI recs
   - Hold metoprolol, amlodipine
   - Vitamin K
   .
   # Vasculopathy: Started on warfarin on previous admission to vascular
   for occlusion of DP/PT arteries.
   - Hold warfarin
   - Continue ASA/plavix for now given fresh stent
   - cilostazol, atorvastatin
   .
   #Hyperkalemia: Strange that it developed so quickly, source of K likely
   from RBCs either hemolysis or blood in the GI tract. Got kayexelate,
   insulin and glucose in ED. Will get dialyzed in ICU.
   - Dialyze
   - Repeat EKG
   - Albuterol/calcium gluconate acutely
   - Repeat lytes
   .
   #ESRD: Still makes urine from transplant kidney, so has been maintained
   on prednisone and  sirolimus but is dialysis dependent. Urgent dialysis
   indicated given potassium.
   - dialyze.
   - Prednisone, sirolimus
   - sevelamer
   - HD dose meds
   .
   #Failed renal transplant: appears he is still taking immunosuppresants
   as he still makes urine and is in the process of being relisted.
   - sirolimus, prednisone
   - f/u renal recs
   .
   #Afib: On metoprolol for rate control at home
   - low dose metoprolol for rate control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and failed renal transplant. He is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications including hyperkalemia, atrial fibrillation, and possible upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hemodynamic instability due to ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. Increased risk of thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation and vasculopathy.
3. Acute kidney injury or worsening of ESRD due to hyperkalemia and possible hemolysis.
4. Infection related to indwelling lines or devices.
5. Poor glycemic control in the setting of ongoing stress and nutritional support.
6. Risk of pressure injuries due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
7. Potential complications from immunosuppressive therapy in the context of failed renal transplant.
8. Respiratory complications due to inadequate oxygenation or ventilation.

Please note that this summary and potential complications are based on the provided information. A thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary for accurate assessment and management of the patient."

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and a history of failed renal transplant. 

The patient presented to the hospital with symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AF) and was found to have a food bolus in his stomach. He underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) but no source of bleeding was identified. The patient was started on metoprolol for rate control of AF.

The patient has allergies to sulfonamides and has been experiencing melena, indicating ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. His vital signs show tachycardia and low blood pressure. He is on multiple medications including aspirin, Plavix, warfarin, metoprolol, pantoprazole, midazolam, and fentanyl.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of creatinine, potassium, and low levels of calcium and hemoglobin. The physical examination reveals signs of cachexia, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, and dusky toes on the left foot.

The assessment and plan section of the note indicates several concerns. The patient's gastrointestinal bleeding is ongoing despite receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs). The plan includes administering fresh frozen plasma (FFP), holding warfarin, and considering a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and peripheral vascular disease (PVD), who has been admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). He is on anticoagulation therapy for his recent stent and PVD. 

During the 24-hour period, the patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) without a clear source of active bleeding. However, he became hemodynamically unstable with a low systolic blood pressure in the 80s post-procedure, which improved with a bolus of fluids. His hematocrit level increased from 22 to 29 due to the transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and his INR decreased from 2.2 to 1.8. He continued to have small amounts of watery melena.

Additionally, the patient developed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) after holding metoprolol, for which he was given beta-blockers and showed improvement in his heart rate.

The patient's allergies include sulfonamides, which cause rash. He is currently receiving various medications such as midazolam, fentanyl, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, sevelamer, gabapentin, prednisone, nephrocaps, atorvastatin, Plavix, ASA, protonix, Lop"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's medical history and current conditions can be summarized as follows:

1. The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and atrial fibrillation (AFIB).

2. The patient recently underwent an endoscopy which revealed a duodenal ulcer with evidence of recent bleeding but no active bleeding.

3. The patient has been experiencing melena (black, tarry stools) which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding.

4. The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels have been declining, despite receiving 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) yesterday. This suggests ongoing bleeding.

5. The patient has a history of chronic renal failure (CRF) and is currently on dialysis.

6. The patient also has a history of a failed renal transplant and is still taking immunosuppressive medications.

7. The patient's heart rhythm is irregularly irregular, consistent with AFIB.

8. The patient has peripheral vascular disease (PVD) without critical limb ischemia and is at risk for further complications.

9. The patient has a small hiatal hernia, thick exudates and erythema of the esophageal mucosa, and a duodenal ulcer seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

10. The patient's abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows moderate per"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleed, atrial fibrillation (AFib), and failed renal transplant. He is currently admitted to the ICU for further evaluation and management. The patient has been experiencing ineffective coping, peripheral vascular disease without critical limb ischemia, chronic renal failure, and gastrointestinal bleed. He is on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, Coumadin, metoprolol, amlodipine, warfarin, fentanyl, amiodarone, and pantoprazole. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 108 bpm, blood pressure of 151/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleed: The patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and is currently being managed with pantoprazole (PPI) and blood transfusions. There is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition.
2. Renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure and is on dialysis. There is a risk of further deterioration of renal function or complications related to dialysis.
3. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on medications for rate control. There is a risk"

","Summary of the patient's progress note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism.
- He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an endoscopy without finding a clear source of bleeding.
- The patient has several medical conditions, including atrial fibrillation, renal issues, and hypoxemia.
- He received various treatments and interventions, including anticoagulation, a transesophageal echocardiogram (TTE) with bubble study, hemodialysis (HD) for hyperkalemia, and administration of medications such as amiodarone, midazolam, fentanyl, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate.
- The patient's vital signs are within normal range, except for elevated blood pressure and heart rate.
- The patient's blood work shows elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as low calcium and magnesium levels.
- The patient's physical examination was not fully assessed due to various reasons.
- The patient's disposition is unclear from the provided information.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient was admitted with GIB and the source of bleeding has not been clearly identified. If the bleeding continues or recurs, it may lead to significant blood loss and require additional interventions such as transfusions or surgery.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism. He was admitted for gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU). The patient has a history of duodenal ulcer, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, and hypoxemia. He is currently on various medications including amiodarone, pantoprazole, morphine sulfate, sevelamer, gabapentin, atorvastatin, Plavix, ASA, sirolimus, fluconazole, and nystatin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: Despite having an endoscopy that showed no active bleeding, the patient continues to have maroon stools, indicating ongoing blood loss. There is a possibility of an aorto-enteric fistula, which needs to be ruled out.
2. Atrial fibrillation: The patient remains in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. This increases the risk of clot formation, potentially leading to a stroke or other complications.
3. Renal failure: The patient's renal function may deteriorate further due to factors such as hypotension, use of nephrotoxic medications, or ongoing bleeding.
4. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels suggest impaired respiratory function. This could be due to lung infection,"

   quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.
   Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF=
   50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global
   free wall hypokinesis. There is a small pericardial effusion.

","The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and underwent an endoscopy that showed a duodenal ulcer with a clean base and no active bleeding. However, he continues to have maroon stools, indicating ongoing bleeding. His hemoglobin (Hct) level is drifting down.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.9°C (100.2°F), heart rate of 109 bpm with irregular rhythm, blood pressure ranging from 182/112 to 109/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94% on nasal cannula. He is in atrial fibrillation (AF) and receiving amiodarone.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 1758 mL, including 616 mL of IV fluids, 360 mL of oral intake, and 768 mL of blood products. The total output includes 110 mL of urine, 80 mL of NG drainage, and 630 mL of blood loss. He has a JVP of 8 cm and no murmurs on cardiovascular examination. His abdomen is soft with no tenderness or guarding. There is slight edema in both lower extremities, with a popliteal pulse present but diminished on the right side.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 47-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed a duodenal ulcer with a clean base and no active bleeding. However, he continues to have episodes of maroon stools, indicating ongoing bleeding.
- The patient's hemoglobin (Hct) levels are drifting down, and there are concerns about a potential aorto-enteric fistula.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is on amiodarone. His INR is elevated, and he is at risk of bleeding.
- The patient has chronic kidney disease and requires hemodialysis (HD).
- The patient also has hypoxemia, possibly due to atelectasis. A chest X-ray is planned.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) - The patient continues to have episodes of maroon stools, indicating ongoing bleeding despite the clean base of the duodenal ulcer observed during endoscopy. This could lead to further decrease in Hct levels and potential shock.
2. Aorto-enteric fistula - There are concerns about the possibility of an aorto-enteric fistula given the patient's ongoing bleeding and history of arterial disease. If present, it can cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding and seps"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a medical history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (Afib), and a failed renal transplant. He presented to the ICU with fevers, hemodynamic instability, and melena, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. The patient has been on aspirin, Plavix, and Coumadin. His current medications include amiodarone, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature of 101.2°F (38.4°C), blood pressure ranging from 109/44 mmHg to 148/49 mmHg, heart rate between 78-137 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation at 93% on nasal cannula, and irregularly irregular heart rhythm.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has developed fevers, which could be indicative of pneumonia, especially considering his immunocompromised state due to ESRD and ongoing immunosuppressive therapy for the failed renal transplant.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's melena and low hemoglobin levels suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation with a GI scope is planned.
3. Vasculopathy: The patient has a history of vasculopathy, and his left foot appears stable. Monitoring and follow-up"

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and failed renal transplant. He was admitted to the ICU for pain control and is currently experiencing fevers, loose brown stool, and an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. The patient has been diagnosed with urinary retention, likely secondary to opiate use, and his left foot shows signs of dusky toes. His lab results indicate elevated levels of potassium, creatinine, and glucose. The patient is on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, Coumadin, lorazepam, amiodarone, morphine sulfate, pantoprazole, and various immunosuppressants.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers, coupled with his recent conversion to non-sustained rhythm (NSR) and chest X-ray findings, raise concerns for possible pneumonia. Empiric antibiotic coverage has been initiated.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's history of GIB and the presence of melena suggest ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding. Further investigation, such as a GI scope, is planned to identify the source of bleeding.
3. Thromboembolic Events: Due to the patient's vasculopathy and anticoagulation therapy, there is a risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embol"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with a history of vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), atrial fibrillation (Afib), urinary retention, failed renal transplant, and on multiple medications including ASA, Plavix, Coumadin, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. 

The patient presented with melena, which indicates gastrointestinal bleeding. A tagged RBC scan was performed and a CT abdomen with contrast was ordered to localize the bleeding source. The patient also experienced a spike in temperature to 101 degrees Fahrenheit with rigors, suggesting an infection. Cultures were obtained and antibiotics (Vanc/Zosyn) were started. 

The patient's hemodynamic monitoring showed an elevated blood pressure of 148/49 mmHg and a heart rate of 83 bpm. The respiratory rate was stable at 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation was 93% on nasal cannula. 

Laboratory results indicated elevated levels of creatinine (Cr) at 8.1 and potassium (K+) at 5.7 mEq/L. The white blood cell count (WBC) was within normal range at 10.2, while the platelet count was significantly low at 55 K/uL. 

The patient has several ongoing medical issues, including vasculopathy, ESRD, GIB, urinary retention, and a failed renal transplant. Management plans include holding warfarin and antiplatelet medications, initiating foley catheter for urinary retention, and considering transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for source of emboli given atrial fibrillation.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening gastrointestinal bleeding, infections due to immunosuppression from renal transplant medications, further deterioration of renal function, and potential cardiac complications related to atrial fibrillation and vasculopathy."

","Summary:
- The patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism.
- He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB).
- The patient has been experiencing fever and has a history of allergies to sulfonamides.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 148/57 to 197/132 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 137 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 93%.
- The patient is receiving several medications, including amiodarone, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate.
- The patient has a medical history of atrial fibrillation, renal disease, and other conditions.
- Lab results show abnormalities in hemoglobin, white blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, blood glucose levels, and electrolyte levels.
- The patient has been undergoing various diagnostic tests and procedures.
- The assessment and plan include management of gastrointestinal bleeding, atrial fibrillation, renal issues, and hypoxemia.
- The patient is being closely monitored and treated in the ICU.

Potential medical complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's ongoing maroon stools and drifting hematocrit indicate ongoing bleeding, which could lead to hypotension, shock, and organ failure if not controlled.
2. Aorto-enteric fistula: The possibility of an aorto-enteric fistula needs to be ruled out, as it can cause severe gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. Infection: The patient's fever and elevated white blood cell count suggest an infection. Proper identification and treatment of the infection is crucial.
4. Renal dysfunction: The patient's renal disease and recent hemodialysis indicate ongoing renal issues. Monitoring kidney function and adjusting treatment accordingly is important.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
6. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate respiratory issues or cardiac dysfunction. Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to improve oxygenation.
7. Contrast-induced nephropathy: The patient's upcoming contrast CT scan increases the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy, especially in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.
8. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility in the ICU increases the risk of developing DVT. Prophylaxis measures should be implemented to prevent this complication.
9. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged intubation increases the risk of developing VAP. Close monitoring for respiratory symptoms and infection is important.
10. Drug interactions: The patient's multiple medications and renal disease require careful monitoring for drug interactions and adjustments in dosages.

","Summary:
The patient is a 47-year-old man with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient has been experiencing fever and has been receiving various medications, including antibiotics. He has a history of allergies to sulfonamides and has received fluconazole and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) in the past. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure ranging from 109/44 mmHg to 148/80 mmHg, heart rate between 76 and 137 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving amiodarone, lorazepam, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. His fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,300 mL and output of 2,927 mL, with urine output of 327 mL. The patient's blood cultures were drawn at 6:00 PM and 6:42 PM on [**2117-11-20**]. He also underwent a red-tagged cell scan, and urine culture was taken at 6:43 PM on [**2117-11-20**].

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's fever and recent blood cultures indicate a possible infection. The presence of fever along with leukocytosis may suggest a bacterial infection, which could potentially lead to sepsis if not promptly treated.
2. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). If not managed appropriately, there is a risk of re-bleeding or worsening of the current condition.
3. Chronic Kidney Disease: The patient has chronic renal failure, which puts him at an increased risk for complications related to fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Close monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels is crucial.
4. Peripheral Vascular Disease: The patient has PVD without critical limb ischemia. If left untreated, it can lead to further complications such as tissue necrosis or amputation.
5. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation (AFib), which increases the risk of clot formation and subsequent embolic events. Anticoagulation therapy may be necessary to prevent complications.
6. Respiratory Support: The patient's oxygen saturation is below normal, indicating inadequate respiratory function. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and potential adjustment of respiratory support may be necessary to maintain adequate oxygen levels."

   development
   of small pleural effusions. The left hemidiaphragm is indistinct and
   the left
   basilar infiltrate cannot be excluded. The heart and mediastinal
   structures
   are unchanged. The bony thorax is grossly intact.
   IMPRESSION: Development of small pleural effusions on the right. A

   view may be helpful for further evaluation.
   Assessment and Plan
   47yoM with ESRD, admitted with GIB in setting of anticoagulation for
   recent stent and PVD.
   1.  GIB:  s/p endoscopy Thursday without clear source of bleeding;
   Friday repeat EGD showed a duodenal ulcer with a clean base and no
   active bleeding. C. diff negative, h. pylori pending.  Tagged red scan
   negative, CTA done and no read back.
   - appreciate GI recommendations
   - continue to trend Hct Q8hours, goal > 25, goal INR < 1.5
   - f/up h. pylori
   - f/up CTA read
   2. Fever: new fever yesterday with rigors, new productive cough and RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Started on vanco/zosyn, CTA at lung bases looks
   like B atelectasis vs. PNA, not enough windows to evaluate fully.
   Sputum cx with oral flora.
   - continue vanco + zosyn
   - f/up cultures
   3.  Atrial fibrillation: developed AF with RVR here with GIB, BBL held
   given HoTN yesterday.  No PFO or ASD on TTE.  Now back in NSR.
   - d/c amio gtt
   - restart lopressor at low dose
   - coumadin on hold given GIB
   - replete Mg to > 2, K to goal of 4 (low dose repletion given ESRD)
   4.  Renal: had HD thursday for hyperkalemia, now K low and in AF. s/p
   HD yesterday after CTA.
   - continue immunosuppresant regimen: prednisone and sirolimus
   - next HD tuesday
   5. PVD: s/p recent LLE vascular stent, now with more foot pain and
   erythema
   - continue asa and plavix, coumadin on hold given GID
   - will t/b with vascular team today for them to reexamine L foot

1. GIB: The patient had maroon stools yesterday morning, with last bowel movement being brown. A tagged red blood cell (RBC) scan was negative, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen is pending. The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since 10 pm. The gastrointestinal (GI) team wants to hold off on re-scopes.
2. Fevers: The patient had a temperature of 101.2 degrees yesterday evening, with a new RLL infiltrate on the chest X-ray (CXR). Pan-cultures have been started, and the patient has been placed on antibiotics.
3. Hemodialysis (HD): The patient had HD yesterday for hyperkalemia. His potassium levels are now low, and he is in atrial fibrillation (AF). He had another HD yesterday after the CTA.

Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): The patient's GI bleeding has not been fully resolved, as indicated by the presence of maroon stools"

   Assessment and Plan
   47yoM with ESRD, admitted with GIB in setting of anticoagulation for
   recent stent and PVD.
   1.  GIB:  s/p endoscopy Thursday without clear source of bleeding;
   Friday repeat EGD showed a duodenal ulcer with a clean base and no
   active bleeding. C. diff negative, h. pylori pending.  Tagged red scan
   negative, CTA done and no read back.
   - appreciate GI recommendations
   - continue to trend Hct Q8hours, goal > 25, goal INR < 1.5
   - f/up h. pylori
   - f/up CTA read
   2. Fever: new fever yesterday with rigors, new productive cough and RLL
   infiltrate on CXR.  Started on vanco/zosyn, CTA at lung bases looks
   like B atelectasis vs. PNA, not enough windows to evaluate fully.
   Sputum cx with oral flora.
   - continue vanco + zosyn
   - f/up cultures
   3.  Atrial fibrillation: developed AF with RVR here with GIB, BBL held
   given HoTN yesterday.  No PFO or ASD on TTE.  Now back in NSR.
   - d/c amio gtt
   - restart lopressor at low dose
   - coumadin on hold given GIB
   - replete Mg to > 2, K to goal of 4 (low dose repletion given ESRD)
   4.  Renal: had HD thursday for hyperkalemia, now K low and in AF. s/p
   HD yesterday after CTA.
   - continue immunosuppresant regimen: prednisone and sirolimus
   - next HD tuesday
   5. PVD: s/p recent LLE vascular stent, now with more foot pain and
   erythema
   - continue asa and plavix, coumadin on hold given GID
   - will t/b with vascular team today for them to reexamine L foot

   Pt is critically ill.
   Total time spent:  32 min CCT
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 47-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and a recent lower extremity arterial embolism. He was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The patient's recent events include:
1. GIB: The patient had maroon stools yesterday morning, with a positive guaiac test. A tagged red blood cell scan was negative, and a computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the abdomen is pending. The patient has been in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) since 10 pm and is not scheduled for re-scopy. The gastrointestinal team wants to hold off on re-scopes.
2. Fevers: The patient had a temperature of 101.2 degrees yesterday evening, and a new right lower lobe infiltrate was noted on the chest X-ray. Pan-cultures have been started, and the patient has been placed on antibiotics.
3. Hemodialysis (HD): The patient underwent HD yesterday for hyperkalemia and is now back in NSR.
4. Atrial fibrillation (AF): The patient developed AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) here with GIB, but it resolved. No patent foramen ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD) was found on trans-thoracic echocardiogram (TTE).
5. Renal: The patient had HD on Thursday and yesterday after CTA. He will have another HD session next Tuesday.
6. PVD: The patient recently underwent a left lower extremity vascular stent and is now experiencing more foot pain and erythema.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.4 degrees Celsius (101.2 degrees Fahrenheit)

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 46-year-old male with multiple medical conditions including vasculopathy, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), gastrointestinal bleed (GIB), atrial fibrillation (AFIB), and chronic renal failure (CRF). The patient has been admitted to the ICU due to various reasons.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.3°C, heart rate of 77 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 165/24 to 193/133 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen.

The patient's physical examination reveals diminished pulses in both lower extremities and evidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The patient also has bilateral pleural effusions and ascites, as indicated by imaging studies. His neurological examination is unremarkable.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, indicating renal impairment. Other notable lab values include low hemoglobin, elevated white blood cell count, and abnormal coagulation studies.

The patient's current medications include aspirin, Plavix, warfarin, amiodarone, metoprolol, pantoprazole, and morphine sulfate. The patient is also on immunosuppressive therapy for his failed renal transplant.

   Assessment and Plan
   46M with ESRD s/p failed renal transplants now on HD; here with GIB
   which is stable.  Other issues include peripheral vascular disease with
   likely embolic event to left toes.
   1.       GI:  Stable HCT, BP, evaluation unrevealing for significant
   source of bleeding except for possible non-bleeding duodenal ulcer on
   EGD.
   - Stable HCT; follow daily
   2.       Peripheral vascular disease:
   - ASA/plavix; holding coumadin for time being
   - vascular to consider OR pending demarcation of ischemic digits
   3.       PNA:  febrile over the weekend, CXR with possible RLL
   infiltrate.
   - continue vancomycin/zosyn; repeat CXR.  If cultures negative, would
   likely continue vancomycin x 8 days and change to cefpodoxime for GN
   coverage
   4.       Renal:
   - HD tomorrow
   5.       CV: atrial fibrillation, HTN
   - uptitrate lopressor
   - restart norvasc

","Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old male with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who has undergone failed renal transplants and is currently on hemodialysis (HD). He presents with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), which is stable. The patient also has peripheral vascular disease (PVD) with a likely embolic event to the left toes. He was febrile over the weekend and has a possible right lower lobe (RLL) infiltrate on chest X-ray. His atrial fibrillation and hypertension are being managed, and he is scheduled for an amputation/debridement due to left lower limb (LLL) progression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding: The patient's GIB may continue or worsen, leading to further blood loss and hemodynamic instability.
2. Peripheral vascular disease: The patient's PVD could progress, potentially leading to additional complications such as limb ischemia or gangrene, especially if there is no improvement in blood flow.
3. Pneumonia: The patient's febrile episode and RLL infiltrate suggest the possibility of pneumonia. If left untreated, this could lead to worsening respiratory symptoms and potential sepsis.
4. Cardiac issues: The patient has atrial fibrillation and hypertension, which require ongoing management. If not adequately controlled, these conditions could increase the risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke.
5. Renal function: The patient's renal function needs"
