","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of invasive bladder cancer, who underwent a radical cystectomy with ileal loop conduit and anterolateral exeneration. She is currently in the ICU due to post-operative hypotension and hyperbarbic respiratory failure. 

24-hour events include the start of arterial line and non-invasive ventilation. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 92/60 mmHg to 138/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 175 mL and output of 209 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 34 mL. Respiratory support is provided through a nasal cannula with standby ventilator mode, with a tidal volume of 1,087 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%. 

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, with normal cardiovascular and respiratory findings. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, following simple commands, and responding to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results include a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, platelet count of 228 K/uL, blood glucose level of 180 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Imaging shows small lung volumes, rotation, and atelectasis, while the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows flattened T waves.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's assessment includes hypotension likely due to underresuscitation, hyperbarbic respiratory failure, leukocytosis possibly secondary to post-operative stress, anemia due to blood loss during surgery and fluid resuscitation, hypercarbia that has improved with non-invasive ventilation (BIPAP), and elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels likely related to surgery.

The plan includes continuing prophylactic antibiotic coverage, transfusing packed red blood cells (PRBCs), monitoring urine output, and providing intermittent BIPAP pending CO2 levels. The patient is also recommended for incentive spirometry and to receive regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control. Prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers is also provided."

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of invasive bladder cancer who underwent a radical cystectomy with neobladder. She was transiently hypotensive in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and required brief use of pressors. The patient is now hemodynamically stable, extubated, and being managed for pain and monitoring hematocrit (HCT). She received a blood transfusion for her HCT level of 26.9. The arterial line was changed, and all other medications and infusions are as previously noted.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient experienced transient hypotension in the PACU, which required the use of pressors. Although she is currently hemodynamically stable, close monitoring of her blood pressure is necessary to detect any further episodes of hypotension.
2. Hypercarbia Respiratory Failure/Atelectasis: The patient has a mild respiratory acidosis, which may be due to hypercarbia respiratory failure or atelectasis. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) was attempted but did not improve her ABGs. Therefore, intermittent bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) may be required pending CO2 levels.
3. Anemia: The patient has anemia likely due to blood loss during surgery and dilutional from fluid resuscitation. She received a blood transfusion, and further monitoring of her HCT levels is necessary to determine if"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with a history of invasive bladder cancer, who underwent a radical cystectomy with ileal loop conduit and antegrade extirpation. She is currently one day post-operation and is experiencing post-operative hypotension and hyperbarbic respiratory failure. 

The patient's arterial line was stopped and then restarted on 05/10/2127 at 02:23 PM. She received a blood transfusion of 1 unit packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and her morphine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) dose was weaned. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), heart rate of 94 bpm with a range of 86-104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/57 mmHg to 136/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute with inspiration, oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 94%, and sinus rhythm heart rhythm. 

Fluid balance shows a total intake of 2,650 mL with 100 mL given intravenously, and total output of 2,180 mL including 845 mL of urine output. 

The patient is receiving supplemental oxygen through a nasal cannula and her arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a pH of 7.33, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 55 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 264, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94%. 

Physical examination reveals the patient to be well-nourished and overweight/obese. Her cardiovascular examination is normal, but her respiratory examination shows diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Her extremities show trace edema on both sides, but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurological examination is also unremarkable. 

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 17.0 to 19.3 thousand cells/mm³, hemoglobin (Hct) ranging from 26.9% to 31.1%, platelet count (Plt) ranging from 205 to 228 thousand cells/mm³, creatinine (Cr) level of 0.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of less than 0.01 ng/mL, and lactic acid level of 0.9 mmol/L. Other lab values are within normal limits or not significantly abnormal. 

Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is likely experiencing post-operative hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids and discontinuation of vasopressors. She also has leukocytosis, likely due to post-operative stress or infection, and anemia, possibly caused by blood loss during surgery or dilutional from fluid resuscitation. 

The patient's hypercarbic respiratory failure improved"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy with ileal loop conduit and antegrade ejaculation one day post-operation. She presented with hypotension and hyperbarbic respiratory failure. The patient responded well to intravenous fluid resuscitation and did not require vasopressors. Her lactates are being trended, and she is receiving colloid and IV fluids with normal saline/lactated Ringer's solution. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's initial post-operative hypotension was likely due to under-resuscitation. She responded to IV fluids and did not require vasopressors, indicating good response to fluid resuscitation. Close monitoring of lactates and continued IV fluids with NS/LR are advised.

2. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which is likely secondary to post-operative stress. It is trending down, so further follow-up is needed to ensure resolution.

3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are stable, indicating no significant ongoing blood loss or ongoing bleeding.

4. Hypercarbia/Respiratory Failure/Atelectasis: The patient initially had hypercarbia and respiratory failure, but has shown improvement. Continued monitoring and respiratory support may be required.

5. NG Acidosis: The patient had resolved NG tube-related acidosis.

6. Post-Op Complications: The patient is at risk for"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with invasive bladder cancer who underwent radical cystectomy with ileal loop conduit and antegrade ejaculation one day post-operation. She presented with post-operative hypotension and hyperbaric respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs have been stable, and she has been responding well to intravenous fluids. Her leukocyte count is slightly elevated but is likely due to post-operative stress or reaction. The patient also has anemia, likely caused by blood loss during the surgery and fluid resuscitation. Her respiratory failure improved with BiPAP, and she has been monitored for obstructive sleep apnea. The patient is also experiencing atelectasis and is being treated accordingly. Pain control has been adequate with patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). The patient's nutritional status is currently being managed through a nasogastric tube (NGT) and bowel rest. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with post-operative hypotension, which responded to intravenous fluids. However, close monitoring of blood pressure and appropriate management are necessary to prevent further episodes of hypotension.
2. Hypercarbia Respiratory Failure: The patient experienced hypercarbic respiratory failure, which improved with the use of BiPAP. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and ensure adequate oxygenation.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated leukocyte count, which may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 63-year-old female with invasive bladder cancer who underwent a radical cystectomy with ileal loop conduit and antegrade ejaculation one day prior. She presented with post-operative hypotension and hyperbarbic respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure of 116/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 2 liters of oxygen. She is alert and oriented to person, place, and time, with no acute distress. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen, tender to palpation, and absent peripheral pulses bilaterally. Neurological examination shows normal tone and purposeful movement.

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 9.2 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 19.3 K/uL. The patient's platelet count is within normal range at 206 K/uL. Other laboratory values include elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.18 mg/dL, sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 3.2 mEq/L, chloride of 105 mEq/L, and glucose of 166 mg/dL. Imaging and microbiology results are unremarkable.
