   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung. He was admitted to the MICU for bradycardia and respiratory distress and was recently discharged. He is now back in the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. The patient has several medical complications, including hypoxemia, potential pneumonia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, hypothyroidism, and a history of pulmonary embolism. He also has metastatic papillary cancer, lower gastrointestinal bleeding, and pseudomonas ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient requires increased oxygen levels and has desaturated to the 80s. There may be an infiltrate on chest X-ray, suggesting possible pneumonia or effusion.
2. Potential Pneumonia: The patient has been on Zosyn for pseudomonas since 8/23 and now has added vanc and cipro. There is concern for pneumonia given the hypoxemia and CXR findings.
3. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count is stable at around 10,000 cells per microliter. Cultures are pending to evaluate for infection.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has recovered from a nadir of 38,000/L to"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with multiple medical complications. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Upon admission, the patient was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory distress.

Medical interventions include administration of antibiotics (Piperacillin and Vancomycin), initiation of IV fluids, and management of blood glucose levels. The patient's oxygenation has been supported with supplemental oxygen and FiO2 adjustments. Synthroid dose was changed to 100mcg IV for better dosing and absorption.

Neurosurgery is planned for the patient, with a medical consult already provided. The patient has allergies to iodine and unknown substances. The patient's allergies, last doses of antibiotics, and ongoing infusions are documented.

Flow sheet data indicates stable vital signs, with a heart rate ranging from 69-94 bpm, blood pressure between 83-120 mmHg, respiratory rate between 15-28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight positive fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

Laboratory results reveal elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin levels, and increased creatinine levels. Electrolyte imbalances include low potassium and magnesium levels. Other lab values, including cardiac enzymes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

Plan of care includes continued ICU management, nutrition support, glyc"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - F/u LENIs to eval for DVT though would be quite difficult to
   anticoagulate (recent GIB and h/o hemoptysis).  If LENIs negative, will
   stop workup given issues with CTA.  If LENIs possible, will discuss
   filter placement vs anticoagulation.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Consider diuresis if CXR wet, though appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - Decrease FiO2 as able
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past.  3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path.
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. Now at end 10 day course.
   -          Will continue course for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro today, f/u cx and
   readdress Vanc pending results
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -Continue Synthroid at home dosing; will look into dosing of
   levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered in
   transfer orders).
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

1. The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung. He underwent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**].

2. The patient was admitted to the MICU for bronchial respiratory bronchiolitis-associated pulmonary edema (BRBPR) and is now being transferred back to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR).

3. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 85 bpm, blood pressure of 106/58 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%.

4. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows an initial total in of 2,382 mL and total out of 3,305 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -923 mL. The fluid balance since 12 AM shows a total in of 502 mL and total out of 680 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -178 mL.

5. The patient is receiving respiratory support through a tracheostomy mask with supplemental oxygen. His ABG results show a pH of 7.52, PaCO2 of 30 mmHg"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung. He underwent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**]. The patient was previously admitted to the MICU for bronchial respiratory bronchiolitis-associated pneumonia (BRBPR) and is now back in the ICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR). 

The patient's current condition includes hypoxemia requiring higher levels of oxygen than previously, dryness on examination, and an episode of rapid heart rate this morning that responded to fluids and Lopressor. His blood pressure is holding above 90 mmHg and is responsive to a 500cc bolus. He is receiving amiodarone, metoprolol, and has been switched from esmolol to metoprolol PO.

The patient also has a history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), as well as metastatic papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. He has undergone palliative decompression and fusion for his condition. 

The patient is being treated for lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), possibly due to anticoagulation therapy. He received a 3-unit PRBC transfusion but is now stable. Colonoscopy revealed ulcers, and a biopsy"

   Assessment and Plan
   A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO.
   - Episode of a. fib with rapid rates this morning as above, responsive
   to fluid and lopressor
   - Increase amiodarone to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - Pt reports he is thirsty and appears dry on exam.
   - ABG [**9-2**] (7.52/30/69/25/1) showed alkalosis.
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - FiO2 down to 50% today, continue to monitor
   - BNP 1249 down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, will discuss long-term plan of care with
   Neurosurgery today
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - followup path- should be available [**9-4**].
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn for now given hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Will plan on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for 14 day course
   -          Added vanc/cipro yesterday, will d/c cipro [**9-2**]
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; will
   d/c  Vanc and can restart  if cultures change
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
   # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - Will culture as above.
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Current transfer meds do not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -          Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will look into
   dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not reordered
   in transfer orders).
   -          Now changed to 100 mg IV daily to ensure consistent dosing
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old man with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lungs. He underwent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**]. The patient was previously admitted to the MICU for bronchial restrictive pulmonary embolism (BRBPR) and is now back in the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR).

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:

1. Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (Afib with RVR): The patient has had intermittent episodes of atrial fibrillation in the past and is currently being treated with amiodarone and metoprolol for rhythm control. The precipitant of the current episode is unclear, but it could be related to hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), other pulmonary disease, or hyperthyroidism. The patient is responding to fluids and lopressor.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient requires more oxygen than previously required (70-100% TM), and there was a desaturation episode to the 80s on [**9-2**]. This could be due to an infiltrate on chest X-ray, possibly small amount of effusion, or another underlying"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lungs. He has undergone T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**]. The patient was recently in the MICU for BRBPR and is now being transferred back to the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). 

The precipitant of the RVR is unclear, but it could be due to hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), other pulmonary disease, or hyperthyroidism. The patient appears slightly dry on examination and has crackles asymmetrically. He is receiving T4 replacement but it seems that he has lost it during transfer (last [**8-21**]). He has been on diltiazem gtt in the past during admission. Initially, he did not respond to 10 IV diltiazem and 10 IV lopressor. His blood pressure is holding above 90 mmHg and is responsive to a 500 cc bolus. He is no longer on esmolol gtt and is getting metoprolol PO.

The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid rates this morning, which was responsive to fluid and lopressor. His amiodarone dosage has been increased to 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] [**9-3**]. He will continue on metoprolol at the current dosing. An echo showed no effusion, ejection fraction (EF) of 55%, and normal leaflets. His TSH level is elevated at 15, indicating possible hypothyroidism. An infection workup is planned, and follow-up cultures are pending.

The patient is also experiencing hypoxemia, requiring more oxygen than previously observed (50% titration mask at the time, now 70-100%). He desaturated to the 80s on [**9-2**] but improved after receiving an Atrovent nebulizer. A chest X-ray shows possible infiltrate and a small amount of effusion. The patient reports thirst and appears dry on examination. An arterial blood gas (ABG) from [**9-2**] showed alkalosis. A pulmonary embolism workup is being considered, although a CT angiography (CTA) cannot be done due to an iodine allergy and post-operative hardware. The patient's FiO2 has been decreased to 50% today, and his BNP has decreased from 1727 to 1249.

The patient has metastatic papillary thyroid cancer with known brain, bone, and soft tissue metastases. No active treatment is planned for now, and a long-term plan of care will be discussed with neurosurgery today. The patient has also experienced lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) while on anticoagulation therapy for a history of PE. He received a 3-unit packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion but is now stable. Colonoscopy showed ulcers, and a biopsy is pending. Daily hemoglobin (Hct) monitoring is planned, and follow-up pathology should be available on [**9-4**].

The patient has developed pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in his sputum since [**8-25**] and has been on Zosyn (piperacillin/tazobactam) since [**8-23**]. He completed a 10-day course of Zosyn on [**9-2**]. He will continue on Zosyn through [**9-6**] for a 14-day course. Vanc (vancomycin) and ciprofloxacin were added yesterday, but ciprofloxacin will be discontinued on [**9-2**]. The patient's sputum from [**9-1**] showed only sparse gram-negative rods as of [**9-3**], and Vanc will be discontinued if cultures change.

The patient has a history of delirium that began this admission. He previously worked but is now experiencing agitation. Reorientation is being performed, and Zyprexa (olanzapine) is given as needed for agitation. Oxycodone dosing will be decreased to q6 from q4.

The patient's leukocyte count has remained stable in the 10K range, and cultures have been obtained. He has a history of PE and is currently on anticoagulation therapy at therapeutic dosing earlier during admission. However, due to the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), therapeutic anticoagulation will be held for now. Prophylactic antibiotics, including pnuemoboots, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and stress ulcer prophylaxis, are being administered. The patient has two 20-gauge peripheral IV lines. His enteral nutrition (ProBalance) will continue via a J-tube at 60 mL/hour. He had a speech/swallow evaluation on [**9-3**], which was difficult to assess for safety, and a written request for video on [**9-5**] has been made."

   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor

   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.

   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.

   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**]; d/c
     Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lungs. He underwent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on 08/07/20. The patient was previously admitted to the MICU for bronchial respiratory bronchiolitis-associated pneumonia (BRBPR) and is now back in the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AFib with RVR). 

Medical Complications:
1. Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response (AFib with RVR): The patient has a history of intermittent AFib and is currently being treated with amiodarone for rhythm control. Metoprolol was also restarted today. The precipitant of the current episode is unclear, but it could be due to hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), other pulmonary disease, or hyperthyroidism. The patient's blood pressure is stable and responsive to fluid and lopressor.

2. Hypoxemia: The patient requires more oxygen than previously required (50% titrated mask at the time, now 70-100%). The patient's oxygen requirement decreased to 50% titrated mask on 09/03. A chest X-ray shows an infiltrate, possibly a small amount of effusion, and the patient's I/Os are even. The patient continues to monitor, and Atrovent nebs are given as needed. A pulmonary embolism workup is considered, although a CT angiogram (CTA) is unable to be performed due to the patient's iodine contrast allergy and post-operative hardware. 

3. Brain Metastasis: The patient has known brain metastases.

4. Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding (LGIB): The patient has a history of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) and is on anticoagulation with Lovenox (60 mg) for a past pulmonary embolism. The patient received a 3-unit PRBC transfusion but is now stable. Ulcers were found on colonoscopy, and a biopsy is pending. The path showed no malignancy but acute and chronic inflammation consistent with ulcer.

5. Pseudomonas Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient had Pseudomonas in the sputum from 08/25 and has been on Zosyn since 08/23. The patient received a 13-day course of Zosyn and is now off it since there are no continued signs of infection. The most recent sputum culture from 09/01 showed only sparse Gram-negative rods, and vancomycin was discontinued.

6. Delirium: The patient has a history of delirium that began this admission. He is occasionally confused and reoriented. Zyprexa is given prn for agitation, and oxycodone is decreased to q6 from q4.

7. Leukocytosis: The patient's white blood cell count has been stable in the 10K range. Further evaluation is pending.

8. History of Pulmonary Embolism (PE): The patient has a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/PE from 01/22/19. He is currently on therapeutic anticoagulation but will be held due to his current condition.

9. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's platelet count has recovered from a nadir of 38K to 89K and 59K on 09/02.

10. Hypothyroidism: The patient's medication did not include levothyroxine, and it is unclear how long he has been off. He is currently being given 100 mg IV daily and will be changed to 200 mcg daily upon discharge to rehab.

Prophylaxis:
The patient is receiving prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."

   Assessment and Plan
 A/P: 66 yo man with history of papillary thyroid cancer metastatic to
   the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lung s/p T1-T12 palliative
   decompression and fusion on [**2160-8-7**], s/p recent MICU stay for BRBPR,
   now transferred back to MICU for Afib with RVR.
   # Afib with RVR.  Has had intermittent Afib in past, on amio for rhythm
   control as well as metoprolol.  Metoprolol just restarted today.
   Precipitant now unclear - hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis,
   PE, other pulmonary disease, hyperthyroidism.  Appears slightly dry on
   exam (crackles asymmetric).  Getting T4 replacement though not
   currently, appears to have been lost during transfer (last [**8-21**]).  Has
   been on dilt gtt in past during admit.  Did not respond to 10 IV dilt
   and 10 IV lopressor.  BP holding >90.  BP responsive to 500 cc bolus.
   Initially on esmolol gtt, now d/c
d and getting Metoprolol PO. [**9-3**]
   episode of  a. fib with rapid rates, responsive to fluid and lopressor
   - No recurrence of a fib in 24 hrs, continue to monitor
   - Continue amiodarone at 100 mg [**Hospital1 **] ([**9-3**])
   - Continue metoprolol at current dosing
   - Echo showed no effusion, EF 55%, leaflets normal
   - TSH 15, see Hypothyroidism below
   - Infection workup, f/u cx
   - LENIs negative [**9-2**], pt has iodine contrast allergy and post-op
   hardware, decreasing utility of CTA.  Also has decreased O2
   requirement.
   # Hypoxemia.  Requiring more O2 than prior transfer (50% TM at the
   time, now 70-100%).  Desat to 80s on [**9-2**], improved after Atrovent
   neb.  O2 requirement decreased to 50% TM on [**9-3**]
   - Now ranging from 50-70% FiO2 trach mask, stable
   - CXR shows ? Infiltrate, possibly small amount of effusion,
   - I/O even
   - continue to monitor, atrovent nebs as needed
   - Consider PE workup as above, though CTA unable to be done (given
   I-allergy); would be very difficult to anticoagulate.
   - BNP 1249 ([**9-3**]) down from 1727
   #Metastatic papillary CA: S/p recent T1-T12 palliative decompression
   and fusion on [**2160-8-7**] with known brain, bone and soft tissue mets.
   -No active treatment for now, planning on d/c to rehab in next several
   days
   # LGIB: In the setting of anticoagulation with Lovenox (60mg [**Hospital1 **]) for a
   history of PE in the past. 3 unit PRBC transfusion but now stable.
   Ulcers on colonoscopy, bx pending.
   - Daily Hct.
   - Path showed no malignancy, but acute and chronic inflammation
   consistent with ulcer
   # Pseudomonas VAP: Pt with Pseudomonas in sputum from [**8-25**] and on Zosyn
   since [**8-23**]. [**9-2**] end 10 day course.
   -          Continued Zosyn on readmission to MICU given
   hypoxemia/instability.
   -          Has now received 13 days of Zosyn, will d/c as no continued
   signs of infection.
   -          Sputum from [**9-1**] showing only sparse GNRs as of [**9-3**];
   d/c
d   Vanc as no change in cultures after 48 hrs
   # Delirium: Pt with history of delirium that began this admission.
   Previously had been working.
   - Seems improved over last 2 days, though still occasionally confused
   - Reorient often
   - Zyprexa prn agitation
   - Will decrease oxycodone to q6 from q4
    # Leukocytosis: Stable in the 10K range.
   - F/u pending cx
   # h/o PE: Pt with history of DVT/PE in [**2159-1-22**]. On anticoag at
   therapeutic dosing earlier during admit (when had GIB); also with
   history of hemoptysis presumably from lung mets; also known brain mets.
   -Hold therapeutic anticoagulation for now as above.  Would be high risk
   if restarted given the above.  Continue ppx dosing.
   #Thrombocytopenia: Plt count recovering from nadir of 38LK --> 89K, 59
   on [**9-2**]
   Unclear if thrombocytopenia was medication related. Stable.
   - Continue to monitor
   #Hypothyroidism.  Meds on transfer did not include levothyroxine.
   Unclear how long this has been off.
   -                 Initially continued Synthroid at home dosing; will
   look into dosing of levothyroxine. -- held since transfer on [**8-21**] (not
   reordered in transfer orders).  Given 100 mg IV daily to ensure
   consistent dosing.
   -                 Changed to 200 mcg daily on [**9-4**] given anticipated
   discharge to rehab
   #Prophy: Pneumoboots, HSQ, PPI
   #Access: 2 20 gauge peripheral IVs
   #FEN: Continue feeds via J Tube.  Had speech/swallow [**9-3**], difficult to
   assess safety, written for video on [**9-5**].  Increased tube feeds to
   Beneprotein at 70 mL/hr.

","The patient is a 66-year-old male with a history of papillary thyroid cancer that has metastasized to the brain, bone, soft tissues, and lungs. He underwent T1-T12 palliative decompression and fusion on 08/07/20. The patient was previously in the MICU for BRBPR and is now back in the MICU for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR). The precipitant of his current condition is unclear, but it could be due to hypovolemia, hypervolemia, infection/sepsis, pulmonary embolism (PE), other pulmonary disease, or hyperthyroidism. The patient appears slightly dry on examination with crackles asymmetrically. He is receiving T4 replacement, but it seems to have been lost during transfer. He has been on diltiazem gel in the past during admission and did not respond to intravenous diltiazem and lopressor. His blood pressure is holding above 90 mmHg and is responsive to a 500 mL fluid bolus. Initially, he was on esmolol infusion, which has been discontinued and replaced with metoprolol PO. The patient had an episode of atrial fibrillation with rapid rates, which responded to fluids and lopressor. There has been no recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the last 24 hours, so monitoring will continue. He will continue on amiodarone at a dose"
