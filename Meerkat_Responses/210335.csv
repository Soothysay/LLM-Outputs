 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   44 yo male with HIV on HAART, S/P AVR and DES, EtOH abuse, and
   progressive dyspnea over 6 mos transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 2 after sz while
   having thoracentesis.
   1) Unresponsiveness: now alert and awake, patient never became
   pulseless, but did appear to be cyanotic but improvement of O2 sats on
   NRB.  Unclear precipitant, but based on history from MDs caring for him
   at the time of thoracentesis, a vagal episode is possible.  Given his
   confusion shortly after the multiple episodes, he may be having
   seizures as well, particularly given his significant ETOH history and
   last drink was 2 days ago.  He may have become hypoxic in the setting
   of aspiration as well, though CXR doesn't seem to show any significant
   abnormalities.  A large PTX could also cause these symptoms, but again,
   CXR does not show any evidence of that.  Hypoglycemia could also cause
   similar symptoms, especially given ETOH history, but BG have been wnl
   here.  Overall DDX includes vagal episode vs. seizures vs. aspiration
   vs. ptx vs. hypoglycemia (or a combination of the above).
   - oxygenating and ventilating satisfactorily based on ABG
   - normal fingersticks
   - f/u CXR
   - currently trending lactates
   - diazepam CIWA Q2H
   - lorazepam PRN for active seizures
   - most likely etiology is alcohol withdrawal seizures; pt falls within
   the [**1-25**] day window when seizures are most likely.  Cont above Rx and
   monitor for aspiration.
   2) Progressive dyspnea on exertion: so far, the etiology of this DOE
   over 6 months has not been entirely clear.  Cath on [**2163-3-1**] without
   obvious disease or intervention.  PFTs showing mild obstructive pattern
   with response to MDI.  BNP elevated to 10,600 on admission.  DDX
   includes heart failure, pleural effusions, overall deconditioning in
   the setting of significant ETOH abuse, or pulm htn.  Of note, primary
   team has been diuresing pt for ? CHF exacerbation/ volume overload.
   - CXR with bilateral effusions, patchy airspace dz c/w mutifocal
   process, cardiomegaly.
   - [**Female First Name (un) **] appears as transudative effusion by Light
s criteria.
   - check ECHO for LV/RV function and valve function (particularly pulm
   pressures)
   - s/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion
   - diuresis once BP improves
   - unclear if this is CHF now in absence of cardiac event or valvular
   lesion.  Can consider pulm htn related to HIV, medications, or
   cirrhosis.  Plan for echo in am.
   - no signs of overt infection; no need for abx
   3) Transaminitis: significant elevation in transaminases without clear
   etiology at this point.  Acute ETOH hepatitis is possible given the
   ETOH abuse, though at this point, LFTs are still upwards trending.
   Also medication effect with ETOH is possible (HAART, statins, etc).
   Could be viral hepatitis superimposed on HIV.
   - appreciate hepatology recommendations; if this is EtOH hepatitis,
   will require new Rx plan
   - attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been
   weaned, have decreased dose of paroxetine
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   - no e/o thrombosis on US
   4) Acute kidney injury: creatinine to 1.4 today, slightly up from
   baseline of 1.0/1.1.  Likely this is secondary to diuresis given
   elevated BUN and hyponatremia as well
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - hold off on further diuresis today
   - trend creatinine for now
   5) Hypotension
 slightly hypotensive overnight, and required 4L IVF
   boluses to keep SBP in the 90s
 100s.  Suspect he was overly diuresed,
   or that he is systemically vasodilated [**1-24**] his liver disease.
   Currently stable.
   6) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DDX includes diarrhea (which pt
   denies), RTA, early renal failure, dilutional, or more likely NS IVF
   replacement.  Pt
s urine osmolarity is high and urine sodium is low,
   suggesting that he is volume down.  His FENa is also < 1.  Will plan to
   bolus to correct volume/dehydration status.
   7) Hyponatremia: mild decrease in Na, likely in the setting of
   diuresis. Also possibly med effect (SSRIs).  Could also be secondary to
   liver disease
   - free H20 restrict
   - check serum/urine osms
   8) HIV: on HAART as outpatient; currently being held in the setting of
   acute hepatitis
   - cont to hold HAART for now
   9) Macrocytic anemia: likely in the setting of ETOH abuse
   - thiamine/folate repletion
   - guaiac all stools
   10) CAD s/p PCI: on ASA daily, no b-blocker. statin held in the setting
   of acute hepatitis
   - cont ASA
   11) F/E/N: regular diet, replete lytes PRN
   12) Access: PIVs

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with HIV on HAART, who underwent AVR and DES, has a history of EtOH abuse, and presented with progressive dyspnea over 6 months. He experienced a seizure while having a thoracentesis and was transferred to the ICU. The patient's main concerns include unresponsiveness, dyspnea, renal failure, and other medical conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Seizures: The patient had a seizure episode, which could be due to alcohol withdrawal seizures or aspiration. It is important to continue monitoring for any further seizure activity and provide appropriate treatment.
2. Respiratory distress: The patient's dyspnea may be caused by various factors such as heart failure, pleural effusions, overall deconditioning in the setting of significant EtOH abuse, or pulmonary hypertension. Further evaluation is needed to determine the exact cause and provide appropriate treatment.
3. Acute renal failure: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute kidney injury, which may be secondary to diuresis, dehydration, or systemic vasodilation associated with liver disease. It is necessary to closely monitor the patient's renal function and manage accordingly.
4. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient exhibits signs of non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could be due to diarrhea, renal tubular acidosis, early renal failure, dilutional, or more likely IV fluid replacement. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the cause"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and recent procedures including AVR and DES. He presented with progressive dyspnea over 6 months and was found unresponsive with cyanosis but without pulselessness. He had a seizure episode, which may be related to alcohol withdrawal or aspiration. The patient's respiratory support consists of a nasal cannula with SpO2 at 98%. His ABG shows a pH of 7.38, PaCO2 of 30, HCO3- of 112, BE of -5, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 224.

Physical examination reveals mid inspiratory crackles bilaterally, dullness at the bases, regular heart rhythm with no edema, and a liver edge felt 2-3 cm below the costal margin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on the nasal cannula.

Lab results show a sodium level of 141 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, glucose level of 101 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.3 mg/dL, TCO2 of 18, and lactic acid level of 2.0 mmol/L. Other labs reveal elevated BNP, mildly elevated liver enzymes, and signs of renal failure with a creatinine rise from baseline.

Plan:
1) Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure episode likely due to alcohol withdrawal or aspiration. Diazepam and lorazepam are prescribed for seizure management.
2) Progressive Dyspnea on Exertion: The patient has been experiencing dyspnea for 6 months, and the etiology is unclear. Possible causes include heart failure, pleural effusions, or overall deconditioning due to ETOH abuse. A chest X-ray shows bilateral effusions, patchy airspace disease, and cardiomegaly. An echo is planned to assess LV/RV function and valve function.
3) Transaminitis: The patient has elevated transaminases without a clear etiology. Acute ETOH hepatitis is a possibility, as well as medication effects or viral hepatitis superimposed on HIV.
4) Acute Kidney Injury: The patient's creatinine has increased from baseline, possibly due to diuresis. Further evaluation of urine lytes and urine eos is planned.
5) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: The patient has non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, which could be due to diarrhea, RTA, early renal failure, or dilutional causes. The patient's urine osmolarity is high, and urine sodium is low, suggesting volume depletion. Bolus administration is planned to correct volume status.
6) Hyponatremia: The patient has mild hyponatremia likely secondary to diuresis or medication effects. Further evaluation of serum and urine osms is planned.
7) HIV: The patient is on HAART but it is being held in the setting of acute hepatitis.
8) Macrocytic anemia: The patient has macrocytic anemia likely related to ETOH abuse.
9) CAD s/p PCI: The patient has a history of CAD and recent PCI. He is currently on ASA daily.
10) Other issues include macrocytic anemia, possible liver disease, and dehydration.

Potential Medical Complications:

 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 RENAL FAILURE, ACUTE (ACUTE RENAL FAILURE, ARF)
   44 yo male with HIV on HAART, S/P AVR and DES, EtOH abuse, and
   progressive dyspnea over 6 mos transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 2 after sz while
   having thoracentesis.
   1) Unresponsiveness: now alert and awake, patient never became
   pulseless, but did appear to be cyanotic but improvement of O2 sats on
   NRB.  Unclear precipitant, but based on history from MDs caring for him
   at the time of thoracentesis, a vagal episode is possible.  Given his
   confusion shortly after the multiple episodes, he may be having
   seizures as well, particularly given his significant ETOH history and
   last drink was 2 days ago.  He may have become hypoxic in the setting
   of aspiration as well, though CXR doesn't seem to show any significant
   abnormalities.  A large PTX could also cause these symptoms, but again,
   CXR does not show any evidence of that.  Hypoglycemia could also cause
   similar symptoms, especially given ETOH history, but BG have been wnl
   here.  Overall DDX includes vagal episode vs. seizures vs. aspiration
   vs. ptx vs. hypoglycemia (or a combination of the above).
   - oxygenating and ventilating satisfactorily based on ABG
   - normal fingersticks
   - f/u CXR
   - currently trending lactates
   - diazepam CIWA Q2H
   - lorazepam PRN for active seizures
   - most likely etiology is alcohol withdrawal seizures; pt falls within
   the [**1-25**] day window when seizures are most likely.  Cont above Rx and
   monitor for aspiration.
   2) Progressive dyspnea on exertion: so far, the etiology of this DOE
   over 6 months has not been entirely clear.  Cath on [**2163-3-1**] without
   obvious disease or intervention.  PFTs showing mild obstructive pattern
   with response to MDI.  BNP elevated to 10,600 on admission.  DDX
   includes heart failure, pleural effusions, or overall deconditioning in
   the setting of significant ETOH abuse.  Of note, primary team has been
   diuresing pt for ? CHF exacerbation/ volume overload.
   - CXR with bilateral effusions, patchy airspace dz c/w mutifocal
   process, cardiomegaly.
   - [**Female First Name (un) **] appears as transudative effusion by Light
s criteria.
   - check ECHO for LV/RV function and valve function
   - s/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion
   - diuresis once BP improves
   - unclear if this is CHF now in absence of cardiac event or valvular
   lesion.  Can consider pulm htn related to HIV, medications, or
   cirrhosis.  Plan for echo in am.
   - no signs of overt infection; no need for abx
   3) Transaminitis: significant elevation in transaminases without clear
   etiology at this point.  Acute ETOH hepatitis is possible given the
   ETOH abuse, though at this point, LFTs are still upwards trending.
   Also medication effect with ETOH is possible (HAART, statins, etc).
   Could be viral hepatitis superimposed on HIV.
   - appreciate hepatology recommendations
   - attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been
   weaned, have decreased dose of paroxetine
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   - no e/o thrombosis on US
   4) Acute kidney injury: creatinine to 1.4 today, slightly up from
   baseline of 1.0/1.1.  Likely this is secondary to diuresis given
   elevated BUN and hyponatremia as well
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - hold off on further diuresis today
   - trend creatinine for now
   5) Hyponatremia: mild decrease in Na, likely in the setting of
   diuresis. Also possibly med effect (SSRIs).  Could also be secondary to
   liver disease
   - free H20 restrict
   - check serum/urine osms
   6) HIV: on HAART as outpatient; currently being held in the setting of
   acute hepatitis
   - cont to hold HAART for now
   7) Macrocytic anemia: likely in the setting of ETOH abuse
   - thiamine/folate repletion
   - guaiac all stools
   8) CAD s/p PCI: on ASA daily, no b-blocker. statin held in the setting
   of acute hepatitis
   - cont ASA

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, alcohol abuse, and recent AVR and DES procedures. He presented with unresponsiveness and was found to have a seizure. The possible causes for the seizure include a vagal episode, seizures, aspiration, pneumothorax, or hypoglycemia. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals mid inspiratory crackles bilaterally, dullness at the bases, regular heart rhythm with normal sounds, and no peripheral edema. 

The patient has several medical complications:
1. Seizure: The patient experienced a seizure likely related to alcohol withdrawal.
2. Dyspnea on exertion: The patient has been experiencing progressive dyspnea over the past 6 months. The possible causes include heart failure, pleural effusions, or deconditioning due to alcohol abuse. A chest X-ray showed bilateral effusions and patchy airspace disease, suggesting a multifocal process, as well as cardiomegaly. A thoracentesis was performed for the right pleural effusion, and diuretics may be initiated once blood pressure improves.
3. Renal failure, acute: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 1"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 35-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for seizure and dyspnea. The patient has a history of allergies to Bactrim and unknown hives. On infusion are lorazepam and heparin sodium. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission, except for the events mentioned below.

Vital signs include a temperature of 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/60 to 71/20 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient received a total of 4 liters of fluids overnight to maintain blood pressure and has shown signs of volume depletion, as indicated by a urine sodium level less than 10 and fractional excretion of sodium less than 1. Urine electrolytes have been ordered to further investigate non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's lab results show a blood glucose level of 141 mg/dL, potassium level of 1.3 mg/dL, sodium level of 16 mEq/L, chloride level of 4.2 mEq/L, bicarbonate level of 33 mEq/L, BUN level of 101 mEq/L, creatinine level of 1.3, calcium level of 7.7 mg/dL, magnesium level of 2.1 mg/dL, and phosphate level of 4.3 mg/dL. The patient's lactic acid level is elevated at 2.0 mmol/L.

Assessment and plan include seizure without status epilepticus, dyspnea, and acute renal failure. The patient is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic medications for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcer, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, potential medical complications that can arise for this patient include worsening of renal function, electrolyte imbalances (especially hypokalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis), seizures, and complications related to the patient's current medications. The patient's unstable blood pressure and low urine output indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which may contribute to further renal dysfunction. Additionally, the elevated lactic acid level suggests inadequate tissue perfusion or poor oxygen utilization, which could be associated with the patient's dyspnea and seizures. Close monitoring and management of the patient's fluid status, electrolytes, renal function, and seizure activity will be crucial in preventing and managing potential complications."

   progressive dyspnea over 6 mos transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 2 after sz while
   having thoracentesis.
   1) Unresponsiveness: now alert and awake, patient never became
   pulseless, but did appear to be cyanotic but improvement of O2 sats on
   NRB.  Unclear precipitant, but based on history from MDs caring for him
   at the time of thoracentesis, a vagal episode is possible.  Given his
   confusion shortly after the multiple episodes, he may be having
   seizures as well, particularly given his significant ETOH history and
   last drink was 3 days ago.  He may have become hypoxic in the setting
   of aspiration as well, though CXR doesn't seem to show any significant
   abnormalities.  A large PTX could also cause these symptoms, but again,
   CXR does not show any evidence of that.  Hypoglycemia could also cause
   similar symptoms, especially given ETOh history
   - will check ABG
   - f/u CXR
   - check fingerstick
   - check lactate
   - diazepam CIWA Q2H
   - lorazepam PRN for active seizures
   2) Progressive dyspnea on exertion: so far, the etiology of this has
   not been entirely clear.  possible causes include heart failure,
   pleural effusions, or overall deconditioning in the setting of
   significant ETOH abuse
   - check ECHO for LV/RV function and valve function
   - s/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion
   - diuresis once BP improves
   3) Transaminitis: significant elevation in transaminases without clear
   etiology at this point.  Acute ETOH hepatitis is possible given the
   ETOH abuse, though at this point, LFTs are still upwards trending.
   Also medication effect with ETOH is possible (HAART, statins, etc).
   Could be viral hepatitis superimposed on HIV.
   - appreciate hepatology recommendations
   - attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been
   weaned, will decrease dose of paroxetine though needs to be done slowly
   given risk for withdrawals
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   - no e/o thrombosis on US
   4) Acute kidney injury: creatinine to 1.4 today, slightly up from
   baseline of 1.0/1.1.  Likely this is secondary to diuresis given
   elevated BUN and hyponatremia as well
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - hold off on further diuresis today
   - trend creatinine for now
   5) Hyponatremia: mild decrease in Na, likely in the setting of

   liver disease

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with HIV on HAART, who presented with progressive dyspnea over the past six months. He has a history of alcohol abuse, recent thoracentesis, and was found unresponsive during the procedure. The patient experienced seizures and was given lorazepam for control. He is currently alert and awake but remains lethargic. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 125/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. 

Assessment and Plan:
1) Seizure: The patient had an episode of unresponsiveness that was initially thought to be a seizure. Although he did not become pulseless, he appeared cyanotic. The improvement in oxygen saturation on nasal cannula suggests that the episode may have been a vagal response. However, considering the patient's significant history of alcohol abuse and last drink being three days ago, hypoglycemia could also be a possible cause. Further evaluation is needed to confirm the cause of the unresponsiveness. 
- Check ABG
- Follow-up CXR
- Check fingerstick blood glucose
- Check lactate levels
- Administer diazepam every two hours for active seizures
- Administer lorazepam as needed for active seizures

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, who presented to the ICU with seizures and progressive dyspnea. The patient has multiple comorbidities including alcohol abuse, previous atrioventricular replacement (AVR), and desensitization (DES). 

Upon admission, the patient was alert and awake but confused, with unresponsiveness lasting for a short period. The initial assessment indicated the possibility of a seizure, but the exact cause is still unclear. The patient's oxygen saturation levels were satisfactory, and his ABG results showed normal values. 

The patient's dyspnea has been progressively worsening over the past six months, and the etiology of this symptom has not been fully determined. Pulmonary function tests revealed a mild obstructive pattern with a response to MDI (medication inhaler). The BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) level was elevated on admission, suggesting the possibility of heart failure or pleural effusions. A chest X-ray showed bilateral effusions, patchy airspace disease, and cardiomegaly. 

The patient underwent thoracentesis for a right pleural effusion, which was determined to be transudative by Light criteria. Further evaluation, including an echocardiogram, is planned to assess left ventricular/right ventricular function and valve function.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of acute hepatitis and liver failure. The patient has a history of a bioprosthetic valve and requires repair or replacement due to atrial regurgitation (AR) seen on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The patient's allergies include Bactrim, with unknown severity. 

The patient is currently on several medications, including heparin sodium for prophylaxis. Review of systems remains unchanged from admission. 

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate between 100-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/77 mmHg to 63/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. Hemodynamic monitoring and fluid balance are also provided.

Laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver enzymes (ALT/AST), total bilirubin, lactate, and lactate dehydrogenase. Other lab values such as potassium, sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, albumin, glucose, and arterial blood gases are within normal ranges.

Physical examination findings are not mentioned in the progress note. The patient's respiratory support includes nasal cannula oxygen delivery with a SpO2 of 99%.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old male with a chief complaint of acute onset of shortness of breath, hypotension, and altered mental status. The patient has a history of bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. The patient's echocardiogram shows severe aortic stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation, and moderate tricuspid regurgitation with significant elevation of pulmonary pressures. This suggests that the patient's initial seizure was due to hypoperfusion caused by bradycardia. The patient's liver function tests are elevated, indicating shock liver rather than alcohol or medication-induced liver injury. The patient's blood pressure remains below his baseline, and he is being transferred to cardiology for further evaluation and possible cardiac surgery. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Valve replacement: The patient may require surgical intervention to replace his bioprosthetic valve due to severe aortic stenosis.
2. Hepatitis/acute liver failure: The etiology of the patient's acute hepatitis/acute liver failure is unclear, but possible causes include medication, alcohol, or viral infection. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause.
3. Seizure: The patient experienced an initial seizure, which may be related to hypoperfusion caused by bradycardia.
4. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains below his baseline, indicating ongoing hypotension.

   44 yo male with HIV on HAART, S/P AVR and DES, EtOH abuse, and
   progressive dyspnea over 6 mos transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 2 after sz while
   having thoracentesis.
   1) Unresponsiveness: now alert and awake, patient never became
   pulseless, but did appear to be cyanotic but improvement of O2 sats on
   NRB.  Unclear precipitant, but based on history from MDs caring for him
   at the time of thoracentesis, a vagal episode is possible.  Given his
   confusion shortly after the multiple episodes, he may be having
   seizures as well, particularly given his significant ETOH history and
   last drink was 2 days ago.  He may have become hypoxic in the setting
   of aspiration as well, though CXR doesn't seem to show any significant
   abnormalities.  A large PTX could also cause these symptoms, but again,
   CXR does not show any evidence of that.  Hypoglycemia could also cause
   similar symptoms, especially given ETOH history, but BG have been wnl
   here.  Overall DDX includes vagal episode vs. seizures vs. aspiration
   vs. ptx vs. hypoglycemia (or a combination of the above).
   - oxygenating and ventilating satisfactorily based on ABG
   - normal fingersticks
   - f/u CXR
   - currently trending lactates
   - diazepam CIWA Q2H
   - lorazepam PRN for active seizures
   - most likely etiology is alcohol withdrawal seizures; pt falls within
   the [**1-25**] day window when seizures are most likely.  Cont above Rx and
   monitor for aspiration.
   2) Progressive dyspnea on exertion: so far, the etiology of this DOE
   over 6 months has not been entirely clear.  Cath on [**2163-3-1**] without
   obvious disease or intervention.  PFTs showing mild obstructive pattern
   with response to MDI.  BNP elevated to 10,600 on admission.  DDX
   includes heart failure, pleural effusions, overall deconditioning in
   the setting of significant ETOH abuse, or pulm htn.  Of note, primary
   team has been diuresing pt for ? CHF exacerbation/ volume overload.
   - CXR with bilateral effusions, patchy airspace dz c/w mutifocal
   process, cardiomegaly.
   - [**Female First Name (un) **] appears as transudative effusion by Light
s criteria.
   - check ECHO for LV/RV function and valve function (particularly pulm
   pressures)
   - s/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion
   - diuresis once BP improves
   - unclear if this is CHF now in absence of cardiac event or valvular
   lesion.  Can consider pulm htn related to HIV, medications, or
   cirrhosis.  Plan for echo in am.
   - no signs of overt infection; no need for abx
   3) Transaminitis: significant elevation in transaminases without clear
   etiology at this point.  Acute ETOH hepatitis is possible given the
   ETOH abuse, though at this point, LFTs are still upwards trending.
   Also medication effect with ETOH is possible (HAART, statins, etc).
   Could be viral hepatitis superimposed on HIV.
   - appreciate hepatology recommendations; if this is EtOH hepatitis,
   will require new Rx plan
   - attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been
   weaned, have decreased dose of paroxetine
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   - no e/o thrombosis on US
   4) Acute kidney injury: creatinine to 1.4 today, slightly up from
   baseline of 1.0/1.1.  Likely this is secondary to diuresis given
   elevated BUN and hyponatremia as well
   - check urine lytes, urine eos
   - hold off on further diuresis today
   - trend creatinine for now
   5) Hypotension
 slightly hypotensive overnight, and required 4L IVF
   boluses to keep SBP in the 90s
 100s.  Suspect he was overly diuresed,
   or that he is systemically vasodilated [**1-24**] his liver disease.
   Currently stable.
   6) Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
 DDX includes diarrhea (which pt
   denies), RTA, early renal failure, dilutional, or more likely NS IVF
   replacement.  Pt
s urine osmolarity is high and urine sodium is low,
   suggesting that he is volume down.  His FENa is also < 1.  Will plan to
   bolus to correct volume/dehydration status.
   7) Hyponatremia: mild decrease in Na, likely in the setting of
   diuresis. Also possibly med effect (SSRIs).  Could also be secondary to
   liver disease
   - free H20 restrict
   - check serum/urine osms
   8) HIV: on HAART as outpatient; currently being held in the setting of
   acute hepatitis
   - cont to hold HAART for now
   9) Macrocytic anemia: likely in the setting of ETOH abuse
   - thiamine/folate repletion
   - guaiac all stools
   10) CAD s/p PCI: on ASA daily, no b-blocker. statin held in the setting
   of acute hepatitis
   - cont ASA
   11) F/E/N: regular diet, replete lytes PRN

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with HIV on HAART, recent aortic valve replacement (AVR) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DES), history of EtOH abuse, and progressive dyspnea over 6 months. He presented to the hospital after experiencing a seizure while undergoing thoracentesis. The patient's unresponsiveness improved, but he appeared cyanotic. His oxygen saturation levels were low, indicating possible hypoxia. The cause of the seizure is unclear, with potential precipitants including a vagal episode, seizure, aspiration, pleural effusion, or hypoglycemia.

The patient has been diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and severe aortic stenosis (AS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR). There is a significant elevation in pulmonary pressures, suggesting that his initial seizure may have been due to hypoperfusion caused by bradycardia. This also suggests that his elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are likely due to ""shock liver"" rather than EtOH or medication use.

The patient's blood pressure remains below his baseline, and he requires ongoing cardiac monitoring. It is concerning that his brady event suggests some urgency for valve replacement. The patient has allergies to Bactrim and an unknown allergy causing hives. His last dose of antibiotics was on [**2163-6-27**] at 08:39 PM. He is currently receiving infusions of Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate of 100 bpm (95-107), blood pressure of 105/77 mmHg (82), respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute (22-33), and oxygen saturation of 99% on a nasal cannula. His heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show a white blood cell count of 7.1 K/uL, hemoglobin of 12.3 g/dL, platelet count of 163 K/uL, creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 141 mg/dL, and lactate levels of 2.7 mmol/L. His liver enzymes are significantly elevated, with ALT at 858 U/L and AST at 736 U/L. Other lab results are also provided.

The patient's assessment and plan include several diagnoses and treatment options. These include unresponsiveness, likely due to seizures or aspiration; progressive dyspnea on exertion, possibly caused by heart failure, pleural effusions, deconditioning, or pulmonary hypertension; transaminitis with unclear etiology; acute kidney injury likely secondary to diuresis; hypotension requiring fluid resuscitation; non-anion gap metabolic acidosis; hyponatremia; HIV on HA"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART, recent aortic valve replacement (AVR), and ethanol abuse. He was transferred to the ICU after experiencing a seizure during a thoracentesis procedure. The patient has been diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis (AS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and elevated pulmonary pressures. He also has acute hepatitis/acute liver failure with unclear etiology, possibly due to medication or alcohol.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C (97%), heart rate between 100-107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/77 to 63/42 mmHg, respiratory rate between 22-33 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 99%. His heart rhythm is in sinus rhythm.

The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 199 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hct) of 35.0-36.0%, platelet count (Plt) of 163-199 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) of 1.1-1.3 mg/dL, blood glucose of 112-115 mg/dL, and liver function tests (LFTs) significantly elevated in the thousands. Other lab values indicate possible electrolyte imbalances.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Progressive dyspnea on exertion: Severe AS, moderate MR, and moderate TR with significant elevation of pulmonary pressures.
   - S/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion.
   - No signs of overt pulmonary infection.
   - The patient's blood pressure remains below baseline.
   - Transfer to Cardiology, alert Cardiac Surgery, and start preoperative preparation.
   - Question: Should the patient abstain from alcohol before surgery?

2. Seizure resolved. Most likely etiology is hypoperfusion in the setting of bradycardia.
   - Oxygenating and ventilating satisfactorily based on ABG.
   - Diazepam CIWA Q2H (has not required).
   - Lorazepam PRN for active seizures.

3. Transaminitis: Significant elevation in transaminases (baseline 100s, currently in 1000s). Suspect shock liver rather than EtOH or medication effect.
   - Less likely etiologies include acute ETOH hepatitis, medication effect, or viral etiologies.
   - Appreciate hepatology recommendations.
   - Attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been weaned, have decreased dose of paroxetine.
   - Follow up hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies.
   - No evidence of thrombosis on US.

4. Acute kidney injury: Creatinine at baseline today. Resolving by [**Month (only) 60**].
   - Trend Cr and UOP.

5. Hypotension currently stable and appears euvolemic. Previously was volume down and given 4L bolus IVF.

6. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis resolving. Urine osmolarity was high and urine sodium low, suggesting volume down. His FEurea was also < 35. We bolused to correct volume/dehydration status.

7. Hyponatremia: Improving. Mild decrease in Na, likely in the setting of prior diuresis. Also possibly med effect (SSRIs). Could also be secondary to liver disease.
   - Free H20 restrict
   - Check serum/urine osms

8. HIV: On HAART as outpatient; currently being held in the setting of acute hepatitis.
   - Continue to hold HAART for now.

9. Macrocytic anemia: Likely in the setting of ETOH abuse.
   - Thiamine/folate repletion
   - Guaiac all stools

10. CAD s/p PCI: On ASA daily, no beta-blocker. Statin held in the setting of acute hepatitis.
    - Continue ASA.

11. F/E/N: Regular diet, replete lytes PRN.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Severe aortic stenosis (AS) with moderate mitral regurgitation (MR) and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) can lead to heart failure and potential cardiac arrest if not managed properly.
2. Acute hepatitis/acute liver failure can progress to hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy, leading to increased risk of bleeding.
3. Macrocytic anemia may indicate chronic alcohol abuse, which can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. Acute kidney injury may progress to chronic kidney disease if not treated promptly.
5. Hyponatremia can lead to seizures or neurological complications if not corrected.
6. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis can progress to severe metabolic acidosis if not managed appropriately.
7. Hypotension can lead to organ perfusion failure and shock.
8. The patient's history of HIV and HAART therapy may increase the risk of opportunistic infections.

   44 yo male with HIV on HAART, S/P AVR and DES, EtOH abuse, and
   progressive dyspnea over 6 mos transferred from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 2 after sz while
   having thoracentesis.
   1) Progressive dyspnea on exertion: Cath on [**2163-3-1**] without obvious
   disease or intervention.  PFTs showing mild obstructive pattern with
   slight response to MDI.  Most likely etiology is severe AS, mod MR and
   mod TR with significant elevation of pulm pressures (as seen on recent
   TEE).
   - s/p thoracentesis for right pleural effusion (transudative by Light
   criteria)
   - no signs of overt pulm infection
   - of note, his BP remains below his baseline.
   - We will transfer to Cardiology, alert Cardiac Surgery and start
   preop. One major question is whether there is any value to having him
   abstinent for some period pre-op or whether his brady event suggests
   some urgency to aortic valve replacement.
   2) Seizure
 resolved.  At least the initial one, was likely [**1-24**]
   hypoperfusion in the setting of bradycardia.
   - oxygenating and ventilating satisfactorily based on ABG
   - diazepam CIWA Q2H (has not required)
   - lorazepam PRN for active seizures
   - most likely etiology is hypoperfusion in setting of bradycardia
   rather than alcohol withdrawal seizures
   3) Transaminitis: significant elevation in transaminases (baseline
   100s, currently in 1000s).   Suspect his elevated LFTs are shock liver
   rather than EtOH or meds.   Less likely etiologies include acute ETOH
   hepatitis, medication effect, or viral etiologies.
   - appreciate hepatology recommendations
   - attempt to decrease hepatotoxic medications; buspirone has been
   weaned, have decreased dose of paroxetine
   - f/u hepatitis serologies, autoimmune serologies
   - no e/o thrombosis on US
   4) Acute kidney injury: creatinine at baseline today.  [**Month (only) 60**] be resolving

   high and urine sodium low, suggesting that he was  volume down.  His
   FEurea was also < 35.  We bolused to correct volume/dehydration status.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DES) in the past. He has also been diagnosed with alcohol abuse and is currently experiencing progressive dyspnea. The patient was transferred from another hospital after experiencing a seizure while undergoing thoracentesis for a right pleural effusion.

Medical Complications:
1. Progressive Dyspnea: The patient has been experiencing progressive dyspnea on exertion. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show a mild obstructive pattern with slight response to MDI. The most likely etiology is severe aortic stenosis (AS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with significant elevation of pulmonary pressures.
2. Seizure: The patient had a seizure that was likely caused by hypoperfusion in the setting of bradycardia. He is currently being treated with diazepam CIWA Q2H and lorazepam PRN for active seizures.
3. Transaminitis: The patient has significant elevation in transaminases (baseline 100s, currently in 1000s). The elevated liver function tests (LFTs) are suspected to be due to ""shock liver"" rather than alcohol withdrawal or medication effects. Less likely etiologies include acute alcohol hepatitis, medication effect, or viral eti"

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of HIV, severe aortic stenosis (AS), moderate mitral regurgitation (MR), moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and elevated pulmonary pressures. He has been experiencing progressive dyspnea on exertion and was recently admitted to the ICU after experiencing a seizure while undergoing thoracentesis for a right pleural effusion.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 105/77 mmHg to 63/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a nasal cannula.

The patient has a history of ethanol abuse and is currently being evaluated for possible aortic valve replacement. The medical team is considering the potential benefits of alcohol abstinence prior to surgery.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, likely due to shock liver or acute ETOH hepatitis. Other notable lab findings include hyponatremia, acute kidney injury with a creatinine increase, macrocytic anemia, and non-anion gap metabolic acidosis.

The patient's urine output has been low, possibly due to poor forward flow caused by critical AS. The patient's fluid balance has been monitored, and he received a 5L bolus of intravenous fluids.

The patient is currently stable,"
