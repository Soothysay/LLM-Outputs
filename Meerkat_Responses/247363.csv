   Chief Complaint: Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure
   24 Hour Events:
   - Tried to wean dopamine but patient
s blood pressure wouldn
t tolerate
   weaning
   - Gave fluids with bicarb x 1L in D5W,  then restarted NS@75/hr
   - Didn't wake up enough to extubate during the day, changed to propofol
   and stopped all other sedating meds.
   - Changed briefly to PS because it seemed like he was waking up, but
   was only breathing 7-9 times per minute so put him back on CMV in the
   afternoon. Repeat ABG showed 7.23/46/107/20, so increased RR from 12 to
   14.
   - Did SBT without sedation at 4am and he did well, woke up and was
   following some commands although still somewhat somnolent off
   sedation.  Decided to resedate with propofol and reevaluate in the
   morning.

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation. The patient has been receiving Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy, which can cause various side effects including cardiovascular collapse, acute renal failure, and metabolic disturbances.

The potential medical complications that can arise from this patient's conditions are as follows:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is due to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration. The patient's respiratory support has been managed with mechanical ventilation, and the recent respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) was 15, indicating a good response to commands without sedation.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require pressors for maintaining mean arterial pressure (MAP) below 65. Hypotension is likely due to recent IL-2 administration, possibly exacerbated by intubation. There is also a concern for sepsis, as indicated by leukocytosis and hypotension in the setting of an immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.

3. Respiratory acidosis and nongap metabolic acidosis: These are likely due to hypoventilation from benzodiazepine administration, body habitus, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect. Serial arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis will be performed during ventilation and after ext"

   Assessment and Plan
   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight
 will wean sedation again and retry spontaneous
   breathing trial with likely extubation this morning
   - Consider extubation to BiPap and may be difficult to extubate given
   body habitus and uncooperativeness at baseline
   - Continue propofol for sedation for now until extubation
   - Could consider steroids for cardiovascular collapse (would give
   high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not start to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure. The patient had been receiving interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy and experienced an episode of agitation requiring the use of Ativan. He also required pressor support due to the administration of IL-2.

The patient's current condition includes hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, respiratory acidosis with non-gap metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. The hypercarbic respiratory failure is believed to be caused by oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.

The plan of care includes weaning off sedation and attempting another spontaneous breathing trial with likely extubation this morning. The patient's hypotension is being managed with pressors, and the possibility of steroid administration for cardiovascular collapse is being considered. The patient's respiratory acidosis is likely due to hypoventilation from benzodiazepine administration and body habitus, as well as a component of IL-2 treatment effect. The non-gap metabolic acidosis is characteristic of IL-2 treatment.

Acute renal failure is suspected to be related to IL-2 administration, but there may also be a component of prerenal azotemia due to low blood pressures. The patient's leukocytosis may"

   Hypotension likely related to IL-2. Leukocytosis and eosinophilia,
   known effect of IL-2 but also at more risk for baceterial infection.
   24 Hour Events:
   Plan yesterday was to get benzos out of his system-- propofol at
   low-mod dose, maintain some fentanyl and try to d/c versed.  That was
   done, pt was on propofol only overnight and pt was evaluated off
   propofol. He was awake, agitated, but did not follow commands.

   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan and recent pressor support due to IL-2 administration. The patient has a history of hypercarbic respiratory failure, hypotension, acute renal failure, leukocytosis, hyponatremia/hyperkalemia, and stress ulcer. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This condition is caused by hypoventilation, which can be due to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration. The patient's recent respiratory support index (RSBI) was 15, and he responded well to commands without sedation overnight but was very agitated. Extubation will be attempted with Precedex around noon today, overlapping with propofol for the next 1-2 hours. Considering the patient's body habitus and uncooperativeness at baseline, extubation may be difficult.

2. Hypotension: The patient continues to require pressors for a mean arterial pressure (MAP) less than 65. Pressor support is necessary due to recent IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation. It is less likely that the patient is septic, but there is leukocytosis and hypotension in the setting of an immune defect with recent IL-"

   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.  Now cdiff negative

   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan and recent pressor support due to IL-2 administration. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's condition include:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This is caused by hypoventilation, which may be due to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.

2. Hypotension: This is likely due to recent IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation. It could also be related to sepsis, considering the patient has leukocytosis and hypotension in the setting of an immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.

3. Respiratory acidosis: This is likely due to hypoventilation from benzodiazepine administration and body habitus, as well as a component of IL-2 treatment effect. The patient also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect and diarrhea.

4. Acute renal failure: This is likely related to IL-2 administration but could have some component of pre-renal azotemia in the setting of low blood pressures. The patient also had a left nephrectomy, and creatinine levels are improving slowly.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 34-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a history of severe sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome. The patient required invasive ventilation and has been on various medications including dopamine, phenylephrine, propofol, and lorazepam.

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 100/60 to 68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight imbalance in fluid intake and output, with a total input of 3,018 mL and total output of 1,795 mL.

The patient has been receiving multiple medications and IV fluids. Notably, the patient has been on heparin sodium for prophylaxis and cefazolin as an antibiotic. The patient's respiratory support has been gradually weaned off, currently on standby mode with a VT of 663 mL, PS of 5 cmH2O, RR of 13 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 70%, PIP of 11 cmH2O, and SpO2 of 97%.

Laboratory results indicate renal failure with elevated creatinine levels and low urine output. The patient also shows signs of respiratory failure, but not ARDS, as per the"

   58 yo male with metastatic RCC receiving IL-2 therapy who presented
   with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan
   and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2
   administration.
   #.  Hypercarbic respiratory failure: Felt to be due to oversedation
   with benzos, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
   - Pressors for MAP<65, will wean as tolerated.  Will preferentially
   wean dopamine per biologics team
   - Recent RSBI was 15, and patient responding to commands without
   sedation overnight but very agitated
   - Will try extubation with Precedex around noon today, and will overlap
   propofol for the next 1-2 hours
   - [**Month (only) 8**] be difficult to extubate given body habitus and uncooperativeness
   at baseline
   - Could consider steroids for significant cardiovascular collapse
   (would give high-dose dexamethasone)
   #.  Hypotension: Continues on pressors.  Likely due to recent IL-2
   administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.  Less
   likely he is septic but does have leukocytosis and hypotension in the
   setting of immune defect with recent IL-2 administration.
   - FU sputum culture and gram stain
   - FU blood cx x 2
   - FU urinalysis and culture
   - Support blood pressure as above
   - Add on diff to AM labs to evaluate for sepsis
   #. Respiratory acidosis and nongap met acidosis.  Respiratory acidosis
   likely due to hypoventilation from benzo administration and body
   habitus as above, and some component of IL-2 treatment effect as well.
   Also has nongap metabolic acidosis characteristic of IL-2 effect.
   - gave bicarb yesterday with good effect (bicarb from 17 to 20 today)
   - Serial ABG during ventilation and after extubation
   #. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 adminsitration but could
   have some component of prerenal azotemia in setting of low blood
   pressures.  Less likely ATN but possible.  Patient also is s/p left
   nephrectomy.  Creatinine improving, but slowly.
   - Monitor creatinine and urine output
   - Check pm lytes
   - Consider urine lytes if creatinine does not continue to improve
   #. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL2, but may represent underlying
   infection.  Will send infectious workup as above.
   - Consider C Diff although less likely given only recent Abx exposure
   was cephalexin during this hospitalization
   - On Cefazolin for skin infection
   #. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal
   insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal
   glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.  Hyperkalemia also likely
   to be due to acute renal failure.  Both conditions resolved today after
   fluid administration, and ventilatory support.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 58-year-old male with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who presented with respiratory failure after an episode of agitation requiring Ativan and in the setting of recent pressor support due to IL-2 administration. The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise:

1. Hypercarbic respiratory failure: This could be due to oversedation with benzodiazepines, underlying sleep apnea, and IL-2 administration.
2. Hypotension: The patient continues on pressors and likely due to recent IL-2 administration and possibly some contribution of intubation.
3. Acute renal failure: Likely related to IL-2 administration but could have some component of prerenal azotemia in the setting of low blood pressures.
4. Respiratory acidosis: Likely due to hypoventilation from benzodiazepine administration and body habitus as well as some component of IL-2 treatment effect.
5. Nongap metabolic acidosis: Characteristic of IL-2 effect.
6. Leukocytosis: Likely due to IL-2 but may represent underlying infection.
7. Hyponatremia/Hyperkalemia: Could be consistent with adrenal insufficiency, and could consider tumor involvement of the adrenal glands in this patient with metastatic RCC.

","Summary:
The patient presented with respiratory failure, which has since resolved. They also experienced delirium and diarrhea overnight. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 37.7°C (99.8°F), heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/78 mmHg to 93/38 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 663 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 70%. 

Physical examination reveals a well-nourished patient who appears comfortable without signs of distress. The patient's cardiovascular system is within normal limits, and there are no abnormal findings in the respiratory or abdominal examinations. The patient has trace edema in both lower extremities but no cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologically, the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal stimuli. 

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count (22.9 K/uL), hemoglobin (11.4 g/dL), and creatinine (7.8 mg/dL) levels. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 86 mg/dL and 128 mg/dL. The patient's electrolytes indicate hyponatremia (Na+: 130 mEq/L) and hypokalemia (K+: 3.4 mEq/L). 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is diagnosed with acute renal failure, acute respiratory failure (not associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome), hypotension (not in shock), delirium, and diarrhea. The patient is slowly improving, with declining creatinine levels, stable blood pressure, and improved breathing. The plan includes monitoring creatinine levels, observing for autodiuresis, and transferring the patient back to the open medical floor. The patient's nutritional needs will be addressed, and glycemic control will be maintained. Prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia are also in place. The patient's code status is full code, and they will be transferred to the floor."
