   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Initially suspicious for pneumonia/aspiration
   given  presentation and CXR findings with possible right lower lobe
   infiltrate.  However, given altered mental status and recent lethargy,
   ? if respiratory failure is mental status related versus C
   diff/abdominal discomfort associated.  Pt has been on pressure support
   with minimal setting since arrival to ICU. No evidence for volume
   overload, CT without evidence of lobar consolidation.  Nevertheless,
   good blood gas and high RSBI.
   - cont mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated
   - reinitiate pain meds
   - trend fever curve, WBC
   - hold abx treatment for pneumonia at this time, so no radiographical
   evidence.
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of extensive colitis.  Started on
   Flagyl/Vanc.  Pt has had several loose bowels since admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # Hypotension: Now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly hypertensive.  Have
   been holding home antihypertensives in the setting of initial concern
   fro sepsis.
   -          monitor urine output and signs of volume status.
   -          reinitiate BP meds (- holding dig, metoprolol, lasix,
   lisinopril)
   # Elavated Lactate: 4.9 on arrival here, now 2.9.  Likely due to
   colitis.
   - cont to monitor
   - bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30 cc/h
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Elevated troponin with lateral ST depressions: Likely myocardial
   strain causing troponin leak.  Trending down.
   - consider ECHO
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH 4.8.  Was off levothyroxine; will reinitate home
   meds

   Disposition:  ICU
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and Clostridium difficile infection who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient's condition is complicated by several factors including suspected pneumonia, C. diff colitis, hypotension, elevated lactate levels, unresponsiveness, myocardial strain, and hypothyroidism.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's altered mental status and recent lethargy raise suspicion for pneumonia or aspiration. The presence of a possible right lower lobe infiltrate on the chest X-ray further supports this concern. If left untreated, pneumonia can progress and lead to severe respiratory distress and sepsis.
2. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, as evidenced by positive toxin A and B tests in the stool. If not properly managed with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care, the colitis can worsen and lead to complications such as toxic megacolon, perforation, or sepsis.
3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has since resolved. However, there is a concern for recurrent hypotension, especially if the patient's blood pressure drops again. This could indicate ongoing sepsis or inadequate fluid resuscitation, potentially leading to organ dysfunction.
4. Elevated lactate levels: The"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, and previous C. diff infection. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, suspected to be due to pneumonia or aspiration. She has been weaned off mechanical ventilation and is now on CPAP. Her fever curve and WBC count should be trended. There is a possibility of pain-related respiratory failure. The patient also has C. diff colitis, with CT showing evidence of extensive colitis. She is being treated with vancomycin and flagyl. Her hypotension has resolved after IV fluid administration, and lactate levels are improving. Sepsis is likely from the colitis. Unresponsiveness is likely secondary to underlying infection and sedating medications, but she is now responsive and following commands. Troponin levels are elevated with lateral ST depressions, indicating myocardial strain rather than an acute coronary syndrome. CK levels are not elevated. Lateral ST depressions are old but more pronounced on EKG today, possibly representing a resolving MI. The patient's history of C. diff should be further explored. She is in atrial fibrillation, and her digoxin and metoprolol should be held due to infection and recent hypotension. Her CHF status is unknown, and a TTE should be obtained when clinically stable. Lasix and lisinopril should be held as well. Hypertension medications should"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   Plan:
   # Respiratory failure: Initially suspicious for pneumonia/aspiration
   given  presentation and CXR findings with possible right lower lobe
   infiltrate.  However, given altered mental status and recent lethargy,
   ? if respiratory failure is mental status related?  She has been able
   to wean to pressure support and FiO2 of 40% upon arrival to ICU. No
   evidence for volume overload, CT without evidence of lobar
   consolidation.  Nevertheless, good blood gas and high RSBI.
   - cont mechanical ventilation and wean as tolerated
   -  urine legionella
   - trend fever curve, WBC
   - trend lactate
   - repeat CXR given discordance between ICU team read and clinical
   concern for pneumonia and radiology read reporting clear CXR
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of extensive colitis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly hypertensive. Lactate
   was elevated to 4.9 on arrival here, now 2.9.  Likely source of sepsis
   would be colitis.
    - cont to monitor
   - bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30 cc/h
   - f/u urine cx
   - send blood cx and f/u OSH blood cx drawn at [**Hospital1 **] earlier today
   - trend lactate as above
   .
   # Unresponsiveness: Likely secondary to underlying infection. Also on
   multiple sedating pain medications. Now appears to be waking up and is
   responsive and following commands. Likely close to her baseline.
   - cont to monitor
   - hold all sedating medications
   - check TSH and dig level
   .
   # Elevated troponin with lateral ST depressions: Likely myocardial
   strain causing troponin leak. ACS less likely. CK not elevated. Lateral
   ST depressions are old but more pronounced on EKG today. Could
   represent a resolving MI.
   - cont to trend CE
   - repeat EKG
   - check TTE in a few days after acute episode
   .
   # h/o C diff: Per records was on PO vanco and flagyl, unclear when
   started and how long projected course was.
   - cont PO vanco and flagyl for now
   - will obtain further history from NH
   .
   # Afib: On coumadin, digoxin, and metoprolol, and dilt as an
   outpatient. Currently rate is well controlled and she is in afib.
   - hold coumadin in setting of supratherapeutic INR
   - check dig level and continue if not elevated
   - holding dilt and metoprolol in setting of infection and recent
   hypotension
   .
   # CHF: Unknown EF as no records in our system. Currently appears
   euvolemic.
   - obtain TTE as above when clinically stable
   - holding dig, metoprolol, lasix, lisinopril for hypotension and
   infection
   .
   # Hypertension: Holding all anti-hypertensives in setting of infection
   and hypotension.

Summary:
- The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), fib, congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection.
- The patient presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, which is suspected to be due to pneumonia or aspiration given the presentation and chest X-ray findings.
- The patient has been weaned to pressure support and FiO2 of 40% upon arrival to the ICU.
- There is no evidence of volume overload or lobar consolidation on the CT scan.
- The patient's blood gas is good, but the respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) is high.
- The patient has extensive colitis on CT, indicating C. diff colitis.
- The patient's initial hypotension has resolved after receiving intravenous fluids (IVF), but the source of sepsis would likely be the colitis.
- The patient's unresponsiveness is likely secondary to underlying infection and sedating medications. Now she appears to be waking up and is responsive.
- The patient has elevated troponin levels with lateral ST depressions on EKG, suggesting myocardial strain rather than an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The lateral ST depressions are old but more pronounced today.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an unresponsive individual with a chief complaint of being unresponsive. The patient has a history of diverticulitis with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding, phlegmon, and right basilar airspace opacification concerning for pneumonic consolidation. The patient's blood cultures were negative, but they tested positive for Clostridium difficile (C. diff) once. Urine Legionella was negative. The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating and required treatment with hydralazine and lisinopril. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.7°F), heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure of 169/45 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on mechanical ventilation. The patient is currently on CPAP/PSV mode with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but normal creatinine levels. The patient's troponin-T levels are within normal range, as well as most other lab values such as glucose, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and lactic acid. The patient has a history of pneumonia, and there are plans to repeat sputum samples. The patient is receiving various medications including antibiotics, analgesics, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's disposition is in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has evidence of right basilar airspace opacification concerning for pneumonic consolidation, indicating a possible pneumonia. If left untreated, this can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and organ dysfunction.
2. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating and was elevated at times. If not managed properly, hypertension can lead to end-organ damage such as cardiovascular events, stroke, or renal impairment.
3. C. diff infection: The patient tested positive for C. diff once. If not treated appropriately, this infection can lead to severe diarrhea, dehydration, and increased risk of mortality.
4. DVT: The patient is receiving prophylactic treatment for DVT. If this prophylaxis fails, the patient may develop a deep vein thrombosis, which can potentially lead to pulmonary embolism and subsequent respiratory and circulatory complications.
5. Stress ulcers: The patient is receiving treatment for stress ulcers. If not managed correctly, stress ulcers can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and subsequent hypotension and shock."

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:   Improved this am.  ? if this is due to pain
   control as initiated yesterday.  Pt with RSBI of 67
   - spontaneous
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of extensive colitis.  Started on
   Flagyl/Vanc.  Pt has had several loose bowels since admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # Hypotension: Now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly hypertensive.  Have
   been holding home antihypertensives in the setting of initial concern
   fro sepsis.
   -          monitor urine output and signs of volume status.
   -          reinitiate BP meds (- holding dig, metoprolol, lasix,
   lisinopril)
   # Elavated Lactate: 4.9 on arrival here, now 2.9.  Likely due to
   colitis.
   - cont to monitor
   - bolus prn for MAP<65 or UOP<30 cc/h

   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   - cont to monitor
   .
   # Elevated troponin with lateral ST depressions: Likely myocardial
   strain causing troponin leak.  Trending down.
   - consider ECHO
   .
   # Hypothyroidism:  TSH 4.8.  Was off levothyroxine; will reinitate home
   meds

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, atrial fibrillation, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.

The potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has shown improvement in respiratory function, but there is still a concern regarding the underlying cause of this failure. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's respiratory status and ensuring adequate oxygenation.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has evidence of extensive colitis on CT scan, and treatment with Flagyl and Vanc has been initiated. The patient also had several loose bowels since admission. It is essential to monitor the abdomen exam and continue the antibiotic treatment for a minimum of two weeks.

3. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but now is mildly hypertensive. Home antihypertensive medications have been held due to concerns of sepsis. It is necessary to monitor urine output and signs of volume status. Once stabilized, reinitiation of blood pressure medications should be considered.

4. Elevated lactate: The patient had an initial lactate level of 4.9, which has now decreased to 2.9. This change is likely due to colitis. Continuous monitoring of lactate levels is important, and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is unresponsiveness. The patient has a history of hypertension, pneumonia, and diverticulitis with associated phlegmon. 

The patient's vital signs show a blood pressure of 170/44 mmHg, heart rate of 62 bpm, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count (460 K/uL), slightly elevated hemoglobin level (11.3 g/dL), elevated potassium levels (5.6 mEq/L), and elevated blood glucose levels (173 mg/dL). The creatinine level is within normal range (0.3 mg/dL). 

The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins and erythromycin base. The patient has been receiving various medications including hydralazine, fentanyl, cefipime, metronidazole, and vancomycin.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sepsis: Given the patient's unresponsiveness and elevated white blood cell count, there is a possibility of sepsis, especially considering the history of pneumonia and diverticulitis.
2. Acute kidney injury (AKI): The elevated creatinine level may indicate an impairment in kidney function, which can be associated with sepsis or other"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, fib, CHF, c diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's current condition include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she does not improve with pain control measures.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a recent diagnosis of pneumonia, and there is a risk of progression or complications associated with the infection.
3. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has evidence of extensive colitis on CT and is being treated with Flagyl/Vanc. It is important to monitor for any worsening of symptoms or complications related to C. diff infection.
4. Hypotension: The patient initially had hypotension but has now resolved. However, there is a risk of recurrence or development of other cardiovascular complications.
5. Elevated lactate levels: The patient's elevated lactate levels are likely due to colitis but should be monitored closely for any signs of tissue hypoperfusion or organ dysfunction.
6. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be secondary to underlying infection and should be monitored for any changes in mental status or neurological function.
7. Myocardial strain: The patient has elevated troponin levels and lateral ST depressions"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and c-diff who presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. She has been admitted to the ICU and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her initial CT scan showed diverticulitis with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding, phlegmon, and right basilar airspace opacification concerning for pneumonic consolidation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has improved with pain management. It is important to continue monitoring her respiratory status and reinitiate pain medications as needed.
2. Clostridium Difficile (C. diff) Colitis: The patient has extensive colitis on CT and has been started on Flagyl and Vanc. Loose bowels have been present since admission, so it is important to continue monitoring the abdomen exam and continue the antibiotic treatment for at least a two-week course.
3. Hypotension: The patient was initially hypotensive but has now resolved with IV fluids. It is important to monitor urine output and signs of volume status, and reinitiate blood pressure medications once sepsis concerns are addressed.
4. Elevated Lactate: The patient's lactate levels were initially elevated but are now trending down. Continued monitoring and bolusing as needed for MAP < 65 or UOP < 30"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. The patient presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia or inadequate pain management. It is important to monitor the patient's oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and ventilator settings.

2. Clostridium difficile colitis: The patient has evidence of extensive colitis on CT scan and has been started on Flagyl/Vanc. It is important to continue monitoring the patient's abdomen exam and ensure completion of the antibiotic course.

3. Hypotension: The patient initially presented with hypotension, which has now resolved. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and urine output. The patient's home antihypertensive medications should be restarted.

4. Elevated lactate: The patient's initial lactate level was 4.9, which has decreased to 2.9. This may be related to colitis. Continuous monitoring of lactate levels is necessary, and appropriate interventions such as fluid resuscitation and correction of metabolic abnormalities should be considered.

5. Unresponsiveness: The patient's unresponsiveness may be secondary to underlying infection"

The patient's vital signs show an elevated blood pressure and heart rate, with a respiratory rate within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is at 100% on CPAP/PSV ventilation support.

The patient has been diagnosed with diverticulitis with adjacent inflammatory fat stranding and phlegmon, along with right basilar airspace opacification concerning for pneumonic consolidation. She has been receiving antibiotics for c-diff and pneumonia.

The patient's recent lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Electrolyte levels are within normal range, except for slightly elevated sodium levels. Other lab results indicate elevated lactic acid levels and normal troponin-T levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include the following:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has improved, but she still requires a spontaneous breathing trial. An attempt at extubation will be made today, and daily chest X-rays will be performed.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill with multiple medical conditions, including respiratory failure, Clostridium difficile (C diff) infection, diverticulitis, coagulopathy, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is intubated and on CPAP/PSV ventilator support. Blood pressure is elevated, but responding well to medication. Urine output has improved after fluids were given. The patient's white blood cell count is trending down, indicating improvement. They are afebrile and able to follow simple commands. Laboratory results show elevated sodium levels, indicating hypernatremia, and an elevated INR. The patient is being treated for C diff and has a free water deficit that needs to be addressed. The patient's code status is full code, and they are currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure, which can lead to further deterioration of lung function and potential ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
2. C Diff Infection: The patient has a C diff infection, which can lead to worsening symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dehydration if not treated appropriately.
3. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which increases the risk of bleeding complications if invasive procedures are performed or if anticoagulant medications are used.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, which is an imbalance of"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c.diff who was admitted with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been extubated and is currently on supplemental oxygen. She has been given D5 NS for hypernatremia, and her blood pressure is being managed with hydralazine and nitroprusside. The patient is also receiving antibiotics for suspected c.diff colitis and pneumonia. Her renal function is stable, and her sodium levels are being monitored closely.

Potential Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which has improved after extubation. However, there is still a possibility of recurrent respiratory failure due to underlying pneumonia or other factors.
2. C Diff Colitis: The patient has evidence of c.diff colitis, for which she is receiving Flagyl and Vancomycin. There is a risk of worsening colitis and potential complications such as toxic megacolon or perforation.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced hypotension, which has been resolved with IV fluids and adjustment of antihypertensive medication. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely and adjust medication as needed.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has atrial fibrillation, and her digoxin level is elevated. It is important to monitor her heart rate and repeat digoxin levels to ensure appropriate"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 57-year-old male with a chief complaint of unresponsiveness. The patient was extubated and given D5 NS, 1L, for hypernatremia. He continues to receive Vancomycin and Flagyl. Lisinopril was advanced to 40 BID, but there was poor pressure control with systolic readings in the 190's. Hydralazine was given, followed by the initiation of a 0.15 nitro drip, resulting in an improvement to a systolic reading of 160.

The patient exhibited wheezing on examination and increased risk of breathing. A chest X-ray showed increased pulmonary edema, likely due to the administration of 1.5 L fluids for hypernatremia. Fluids were stopped, and Lasix 40 was given in the afternoon, followed by 30 mg in the evening. Morphine was also administered, leading to good results.

The patient has allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and an unknown allergy to erythromycin lactobionate. The last doses of antibiotics received were cefepime on 2194-12-22 at 07:45 PM, Vancomycin on 2194-12-24 at 08:24 PM, and Metronidazole on 2194-12-25 at 02:11 AM.

The patient is currently receiving various infusions, including Furosemide (Lasix) started on 2194-12-24 at 08:50 PM, Hydralazine started on 2194-12-24 at 08:50 PM, and Morphine sulfate started on 2194-12-24 at 09:00 PM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below. The flow sheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Hemodynamic monitoring reveals that the patient's maximum temperature was 36.9°C (98.5°F) and current temperature was 35.6°C (96°F). The patient's heart rhythm is atrial flutter, with blood pressures ranging from 125/58 mmHg to 196/92 mmHg. The respiratory rate is within normal limits, and oxygen saturation remains at 99%.

The patient has received a total of 1,638 mL of fluids, with an output of 1,030 mL through urine. The respiratory support includes delivery via a face tent, ventilator mode on standby, tidal volume (Vt) of 244 mL, peak inspiratory pressure (PS) of 10 cmH2O, respiratory rate (RR) of 22, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 8 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) set at 50%. The arterial blood gas (ABG) values indicate a pH"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated yesterday. Likely had episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am rounds. HTN with wheezing and crackles in respiratory
   distress for 2 hrs yesterday, unresponsive to nebulizer tx, but rapidly
   improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt. Hydal and lasix continuing, but
   nitro gtt off since 0600.
   -          Continue cautious diuresis
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff.  Pt has had several loose bowels since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive.  Reinitiated
 dose lisinopril last night.
   -          reinitiate BP meds as tolerated.
   -          CVP check now that pt has central line
   # Afib- holding digoxin for elevated level on admission.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restart digoxin
   -          Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic inr. Likely [**2-8**]
   flagyl. Check LFTs.
   # Hypernatremia:  149 this AM. Free water deficit 2 L.  Pt also appears
   dry on exam and UOP down.
   -          Will plan to give 250 cc q4 with Tfs
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Restart TFs today (were held for colitis and
   ? re-intubation).

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. She was extubated yesterday and received D5NS, 1L for hypernatremia. She is currently on vancomycin and flagyl for c-diff. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, requiring adjustment of medications. She also has evidence of increased pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and the presence of crackles at the bases of the lungs indicate ongoing pulmonary issues. This may require further interventions such as non-invasive ventilation or re-intubation if necessary.

2. C-diff colitis: The patient is already on flagyl and vancomycin for c-diff. Monitoring the abdomen exam and ensuring a minimum two-week course of antibiotics are essential to prevent worsening of symptoms.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure has been fluctuating, with episodes of hypotension and now mild hypertension. Reinitiating BP meds as tolerated and checking CVP with the central line are necessary.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is holding digoxin due to elevated levels on admission. Restarting digoxin and monitoring for any signs of toxicity are important.

5. Hypernatremia: The patient"

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated yesterday. Likely had episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am rounds. HTN with wheezing and crackles in respiratory
   distress for 2 hrs yesterday, unresponsive to nebulizer tx, but rapidly
   improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   -          Continue cautious diuresis
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr

   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff.  Pt has had several loose bowels since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive.  Reinitiated
 dose lisinopril last night.
   -          reinitiate BP meds as tolerated.
   # Afib- holding digoxin for elevated level on admission.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Add level to tommorow
s labs and dose appropriately
   # Hypernatremia:  149 this AM. Free water deficit 2 L.  Pt also appears
   dry on exam and UOP down.
   -          Will plan to give 1 L D5 W
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr

   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG tube placement, fib, CHF, and c.diff who presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and is currently extubated.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema and required aggressive diuresis with Lasix, hydralazine, and nitroglycerin. Close monitoring of the patient's respiratory status is necessary, and consideration should be given to non-invasive ventilation if hypoxia occurs.

2. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis: The patient has been treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin for C. diff. It is important to continue monitoring the abdomen for any signs of worsening colitis. The current course of antibiotics should be continued for a minimum of two weeks.

3. Hypertension: The patient was initially hypotensive but improved with IV fluids. Lisinopril was reinitiated last night. Regular monitoring of blood pressure is required, and medications should be adjusted accordingly.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, and digoxin levels were elevated on admission. No evidence of toxicity is currently observed. The digoxin dose should be adjusted appropriately based on the latest lab results.

- The patient was extubated, given D5 NS to correct hypernatremia, and continued on Vancomycin and Flagyl for c-diff.
- Her blood pressure was poorly controlled with systolic readings in the 190's, so she was given hydralazine and started on a nitro drip.
- The patient exhibited wheezing and increased risk of breathing, with increased pulmonary edema seen on chest X-ray.
- Fluids were stopped, Lasix was given, and morphine resulted in good outcomes.
- The patient's last doses of antibiotics were cefipime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.
- Vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/36 (55) mmHg to 196/92 (113) mmHg, respiratory rate of 15-24 insp/min, and oxygen saturation of 99%.

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated yesterday. Likely had episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am rounds. HTN with wheezing and crackles in respiratory
   distress for 2 hrs yesterday, unresponsive to nebulizer tx, but rapidly
   improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   -          Continue cautious diuresis
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff.  Pt has had several loose bowels since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive.  Reinitiated
 dose lisinopril last night.
   -          reinitiate BP meds as tolerated.
   # Afib- holding digoxin for elevated level on admission.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Add level to tommorow
s labs and dose appropriately
   # Hypernatremia:  149 this AM. Free water deficit 2 L.  Pt also appears
   dry on exam and UOP down.
   -          Will plan to give 1 L D5 W
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Restart TFs today (were held for colitis and
   ? re-intubation).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG tube, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely due to pneumonia. She was extubated yesterday and given D5NS for hypernatremia. Her blood pressure has been fluctuating, with recent improvement after administration of Hydralazine and nitro drip. She also has increased pulmonary edema, which was managed with Lasix. The patient is currently on Vancomycin and Flagyl for c-diff colitis and has shown loose bowels since admission. Her electrolytes are somewhat imbalanced, including hypernatremia. She has been unresponsive, but minimally interactive, and appears to be responsive to examination. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's recent episode of respiratory failure suggests that she may be at risk for further respiratory complications. This could include worsening pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or the need for re-intubation.

2. Fluid Overload: The patient's history of CHF and the recent administration of 1.5 L D5NS suggest that she may be at risk for fluid overload. This can lead to pulmonary edema, worsening heart failure, and potentially cardiogenic shock.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium level indicates hypernatremia. If not corrected, this can"

The patient has a history of pneumonia, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), hypernatremia, and coagulopathy. 

During the night, the patient experienced hypertension and wheezing. Treatment included starting a titranium infusion and administering Lasix. The patient's respiratory distress improved, and they are now on supplemental oxygen via a 50% mask with acceptable oxygen saturation levels.

The patient has achieved a negative fluid balance, and their blood pressure has improved. They are currently on various medications, including furosemide (Lasix), hydralazine, morphine sulfate, insulin, flagyl, vancomycin orally, fentanyl patch, and lisinopril. The patient also requires free water flushes.

Physical examination reveals that the patient is well-nourished, overweight, and not in acute distress. They have diffuse expiratory wheezes, more prominent when awake. Other findings include symmetric chest expansion, normal heart rhythm, and no peripheral edema or cyanosis.

Lab results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, increased potassium levels, and abnormal liver function tests. Imaging shows moderate left pleural effusion with increased interstitial markings.

Assessment and Plan:
- Hypertension, benign

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had several loose bowels
   since admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**]). Transition Flagyl to po today.
          -      daughter has requested probiotics which I advised she
   bring in herself, as per hospital policy
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated [**12-24**]. On [**12-25**], had an episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am. Was hypertensive with wheezing and crackles unresponsive
   to nebulizer tx, but rapidly improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          TTE to evaluate EF in setting of pleural effusions and known
   heart failure
   # CHF: Restart carvedilol and diuretics prn.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive. CVP 8.  Reinitiated home dose lisinopril and have been
   providing lasix prn. Also takes Carvedilol, Lasix, Spirnolactone at
   home.
   -          Continue lisinopril and reinitiate other home BP meds as
   tolerated.
   -          Restart carvedilol
   -          Follow cvp
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restart digoxin. Restart Carvedilol today with holding
   parameters.
   -          Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic inr. Likely [**2-8**]
   flagyl. LFTs wnl.
   # Hypernatremia:  149 yesterday but improved to 141 today with free
   water via PEG tube. UOP improved with lasix.
   -          Will plan to decrease free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Calciium corrects to 8.4 On TFs (were held
   for colitis and ? re-intubation).

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, and C. difficile infection. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and her stool specimens are positive for C. difficile colitis. Her CT scan shows evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon. She has been on Flagyl/Vanc for C. difficile and has had loose bowels since admission. Her recent medical interventions include being exubated, experiencing flash pulmonary edema, and having an episode of hypernatremia. She has a history of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and hypertension.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with respiratory failure, which required intubation. She was later exubated but had an episode of flash pulmonary edema. Continuous monitoring and oxygen supplementation via facemask are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation.

2. C. Difficile Colitis: The patient has tested positive for C. difficile colitis and is currently being treated with Flagyl and Vanc. She should continue to receive these medications for a minimum of two weeks. Monitoring her abdominal exam and stool output is important to assess the progress of her treatment.

3. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of CHF and may require diuretics and carvedilol to manage her symptoms. Close monitoring of her"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with unresponsiveness as the chief complaint. She has been in the ICU with various medical complications. The 24-hour events include correcting hypernatremia with free water boluses, restarting digoxin, and administering lasix with good urine output. The patient has allergies to penicillins and erythromycin base, and her last doses of antibiotics were vancomycin on 12/24/2194 at 8:24 PM and metronidazole on 12/26/2194 at 2:28 AM. She is currently on multiple infusions including furosemide (lasix) and other ICU medications. Her review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for being non-verbal, not appearing to be in pain, and shaking her head when asked.

Flowsheet Data:
The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 119/51 mmHg to 145/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. The patient has atrial fibrillation as her heart rhythm. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is within normal range at 8 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,406 mL and output of 2,400 mL, resulting in a balance of 6 mL. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated yesterday. Likely had episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am rounds. HTN with wheezing and crackles in respiratory
   distress for 2 hrs yesterday, unresponsive to nebulizer tx, but rapidly
   improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt. Hydal and lasix continuing, but
   nitro gtt off since 0600.
   -          Continue cautious diuresis
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff.  Pt has had several loose bowels since
   admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
   -          Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive.  Reinitiated
 dose lisinopril last night.
   -          reinitiate BP meds as tolerated.
   -          CVP check now that pt has central line
   # Afib- holding digoxin for elevated level on admission.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restart digoxin
   -          Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic inr. Likely [**2-8**]
   flagyl. Check LFTs.
   # Hypernatremia:  149 this AM. Free water deficit 2 L.  Pt also appears
   dry on exam and UOP down.
   -          Will plan to give 250 cc q4 with Tfs
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Restart TFs today (were held for colitis and
   ? re-intubation).

   bring in herself, as per hospital policy
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated [**12-24**]. On [**12-25**], had an episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am. Was hypertensive with wheezing and crackles unresponsive
   to nebulizer tx, but rapidly improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic

   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive. CVP 8.  Reinitiated home dose lisinopril and have been
   providing lasix prn. Also takes Carvedilol, Lasix, Spirnolactone at
   home.
   -          Continue lisinopril and reinitiate other home BP meds as
   tolerated.
   -          Follow cvp
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restart digoxin

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and her stool specimens are positive for C diff colitis. The CT scan shows evidence of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has had several loose bowels since admission. She has been treated with Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff. Her vital signs are stable, but she experienced an episode of flash pulmonary edema that resolved with lasix and other medications. The patient's blood pressure was initially hypotensive and now is mildly hypertensive. Her CVP is 8. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via facemask and daily chest x-rays will be done. She is also on home medications for blood pressure and heart failure. Her digoxin was restarted due to atrial fibrillation and supratherapeutic INR. She has hypernatremia, but it has improved with free water via PEG tube. The patient's unresponsiveness is likely secondary to underlying infection. Her electrolytes are replete and calcium has been corrected. She is receiving nutrition through a feeding tube and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation of respiratory failure is concerning. She required intubation and supplemental oxygen. Close monitoring of her respiratory status"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had several loose bowels
   since admission, and continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal
   rectal tube.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**])
          -      daughter has requested probiotics which I advised she
   bring in herself, as per hospital policy
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated [**12-24**]. On [**12-25**], had an episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am. Was hypertensive with wheezing and crackles unresponsive
   to nebulizer tx, but rapidly improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   CXR demonsrates large RIGHT sided pleural effusion. Unlikely to be
   malignant or panapneumonic given that effusion was not present on
   admission CXR [**12-22**]. Although patient carries a dx of CHF, TTE on [**12-26**]
   demonstrated intact left sided systolic function.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Repeat abg to monitor for hypercarbia
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          Plan to diurese today in effort to improve RIGHT sided
   pleural effusion. No plan for thoracentesis today, but if oxygenation
   worsens would consider a therapeutic tap.
   # CHF: Continue carvedilol and diuretics prn. Once BP more stable,
   consider restarting at home diuretics of Spironlactone.
   .
   # BP/Hemodynamics:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt
   mildly hypertensive. CVP 5.  Reinitiated home dose lisinopril and have
   been providing lasix prn. Also takes Carvedilol, Lasix, Spirnolactone
   at home.
   -          Continue lisinopril and Carvedilol
   -          Follow cvp
   -          Monitor UOP and consider lasix to keep patient net negative
   500 cc to 1 L
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity. INR now subtherapeutic, and coumadin was held
   since admission secondary supratherapeutic INR that was felt to be [**2-8**]
   flagyl.
   -          Restarted digoxin. Restarted Carvedilol today with holding
   parameters.
   -          Restart coumadin at
 home dose today and monitor INR.
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water via PEG tube. UOP improved
   with lasix.
   -          Will plan to decrease free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Calciium corrects to 8.4 On TFs (were held
   for colitis and ? re-intubation).

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had several loose bowels
   since admission, and continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal
   rectal tube.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**])
          -      daughter has requested probiotics which I advised she
   bring in herself, as per hospital policy
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated [**12-24**]. On [**12-25**], had an episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am. Was hypertensive with wheezing and crackles unresponsive
   to nebulizer tx, but rapidly improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   CXR demonsrates large RIGHT sided pleural effusion. Although patient
   carries a dx of CHF, TTE on [**12-26**] demonstrated intact left sided
   systolic function.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   # CHF: Continue carvedilol and diuretics prn. Once BP more stable,
   consider restarting at home diuretics of Spironlactone.
   .
   # BP/Hemodynamics:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt
   mildly hypertensive. CVP 5.  Reinitiated home dose lisinopril and have
   been providing lasix prn. Also takes Carvedilol, Lasix, Spirnolactone
   at home.
   -          Continue lisinopril and Carvedilol
   -          Follow cvp
   -          Monitor UOP and consider lasix to keep patient net negative
   500 cc to 1 L
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restarted digoxin. Restarted Carvedilol today with holding
   parameters.
   -          Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic inr. Likely [**2-8**]
   flagyl. LFTs wnl.
   # Hypernatremia:  Improved with free water via PEG tube. UOP improved
   with lasix.
   -          Will plan to decrease free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Calciium corrects to 8.4 On TFs (were held
   for colitis and ? re-intubation).

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has positive stool specimens for C-diff colitis. The patient's recent medical interventions include transitioning Flagyl from IV to po, continuing Vancomycin po, restarting Carvedilol, and administering a 500 cc bolus of normal saline. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 117/52 mmHg and a heart rate of 80 bpm. The patient is on supplemental oxygen via face tent with an SpO2 of 94%. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the left base and decreased breath sounds at the right base. The patient has 1+ upper extremity edema and 1+ lower extremity edema bilaterally. The patient's neurological examination shows a downgoing plantar reflex on the left and an upgoing plantar reflex on the right. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated lactate levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low potassium level. The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing treatment for C-diff colitis, respiratory failure, CHF, and hypertension. The patient's medications include Flagyl, Vancomycin, Carvedilol"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  CT with evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon.  On
   Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had several loose bowels
   since admission.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**]). Transition Flagyl to po today.
          -      daughter has requested probiotics which I advised she
   bring in herself, as per hospital policy
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Exubated [**12-24**]. On [**12-25**], had an episode of
   flash pulmonary edema in the setting of volume resucitation with 1.5 L
   D5
 NS at am. Was hypertensive with wheezing and crackles unresponsive
   to nebulizer tx, but rapidly improved with lasix, hydral, nitro gtt.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          TTE to evaluate EF in setting of pleural effusions and known
   heart failure
   # CHF: Restart carvedilol and diuretics prn.
   .
   # BP:  Was hypotensive, and now resolved s/p IVF and pt mildly
   hypertensive. CVP 8.  Reinitiated home dose lisinopril and have been
   providing lasix prn. Also takes Carvedilol, Lasix, Spirnolactone at
   home.
   -          Continue lisinopril and reinitiate other home BP meds as
   tolerated.
   -          Restart carvedilol
   -          Follow cvp
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity.
   -          Restart digoxin. Restart Carvedilol today with holding
   parameters.
   -          Holding coumadin given supratherapeutic inr. Likely [**2-8**]
   flagyl. LFTs wnl.
   # Hypernatremia:  149 yesterday but improved to 141 today with free
   water via PEG tube. UOP improved with lasix.
   -          Will plan to decrease free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline and appears
   to be interactive to exam.  Initial presentation likely secondary to
   underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn. Calciium corrects to 8.4 On TFs (were held
   for colitis and ? re-intubation).

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection, and diverticulitis/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely secondary to an underlying infection. The patient is currently on Flagyl and Vancomycin for C. diff colitis and has been receiving supplemental oxygen via a face tent. She was previously intubated but has since been exubated.

Medical Complications:

1. C. diff Colitis: The patient's stool specimens are positive for C. diff colitis, and a CT scan shows evidence of diverticulitis/phlegmon. She is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin. The plan is to continue this treatment for a minimum of two weeks, transitioning Flagyl to oral administration today.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient had an episode of flash pulmonary edema in response to volume resuscitation. She rapidly improved with Lasix, hydralazine, and nitroglycerin. She is currently on supplemental oxygen via a face mask, with saturations above 92%. Consideration is being given to non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic. Daily chest X-rays will be performed to monitor her respiratory status.

3. CHF: The patient has a history of CHF, and her"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly female with unresponsiveness. She has a history of heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection, stroke, respiratory failure, benign hypertension, and community-acquired pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and is being treated for multiple conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening heart failure: The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, and her current condition may lead to further deterioration in cardiac function.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to immobilization and has been placed on prophylactic measures, including supratherapeutic INR and pneumatic boots.
3. Pressure ulcers: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of developing pressure ulcers, especially given her unresponsiveness and potential bedridden state.
4. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection and is at risk for developing other infections due to her weakened immune system and prolonged ICU stay.
5. Respiratory complications: The patient has respiratory failure and is on mechanical ventilation, increasing the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or other respiratory complications.
6. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke, and her current condition may increase the risk of further neurological complications.
7. Kidney injury: The patient's elevated creatinine levels suggest possible kidney injury, which can"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-inch tall individual with a weight of 35 kg, presenting with unresponsiveness. The patient has a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection, stroke, respiratory failure, hypertension, and pneumonia. The patient is currently in the ICU and has been receiving various medications and treatments.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Heart Failure: The patient has a history of heart failure and is currently showing signs of pulmonary artery systolic hypertension, which may indicate worsening heart failure.
2. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation, which can lead to irregular heart rhythms and potential complications such as blood clots or stroke.
3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which can increase the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.
4. Clostridium Difficile Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can cause severe diarrhea and colitis. This infection can be life-threatening if not properly managed.
5. Respiratory Failure: The patient has a history of acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by various factors including pneumonia or other lung conditions.
6. Stroke: The patient has a history of stroke, which can result in long-term neurological deficits and disability.
7. Hypertension: The patient has a history of hypertension, which, if uncontrolled, can lead to complications such as heart attack"

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-inch old individual admitted to the ICU with c diff colitis and sepsis. They have a history of heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, and a previous stroke. The patient also has respiratory failure, benign hypertension, pneumonia, and requires ICU care.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Heart failure exacerbation due to impaired cardiac function and fluid overload.
2. Increased risk of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) due to immobilization and hypercoagulable state.
3. Worsening of skin integrity and potential development of pressure ulcers due to prolonged immobility and impaired tissue perfusion.
4. Possible recurrence or worsening of Clostridium difficile infection leading to more severe colitis.
5. Respiratory compromise and potential development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
6. Hypotension and shock due to sepsis and inadequate organ perfusion.
7. Acute kidney injury (AKI) or renal failure due to hypoperfusion and toxic effects of medications or infections.
8. Electrolyte imbalances and disturbances due to ongoing losses and renal dysfunction.
9. Arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation with increased risk of embolic events.
10. Malnutrition and poor nutritional status due to impaired gut function and"

   exam she is having shallow breathing, RLL bronchial BS, likely

   check ABG, will attempt 500 cc to 1000 cc negative, sit up in bed
   even OOB to chair, Role of tap is challenging as it is not clearly
   impacting her oxygenation, is likely due to fluid overload which should
   resolve with diuresis, and would require reversing INR (and fluid) to
   perform. In order to better assess risk benefit switch her to Venti
   mask and titrate Oi2 needs as we diurese today and hold off on tapping.

","Summary:
The patient is a 57-inch female with a chief complaint of c diff colitis and sepsis. She has a history of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, C. difficile infection, stroke, respiratory failure, hypertension, and pneumonia. The patient's respiratory status is stable, but she is experiencing shallow breathing and has right lower lobe bronchial secretions. She is currently on a face tent with oxygen saturation of 98%. Her vital signs include a temperature of 36.4°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 132/55 mmHg, respiratory rate of 13 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98%. Her physical examination reveals 3+ pedal edema and decreased breath sounds on the right side. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's shallow breathing and presence of right lower lobe bronchial secretions indicate a potential respiratory failure. Measures such as checking ABG, attempting negative fluid balance, sitting up in bed or out of bed, and using a venti mask with titrated O2 needs should be implemented.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: Although the patient's hemodynamics are currently stable, there is a risk of developing hemodynamic instability due to her heart failure and impaired cardiac function. Close monitoring of blood pressure and heart rate is essential.
3. Infection: The patient has a history of C. difficile infection, which can"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had
   several loose bowels since admission, and continues to have loose stool
   through Flexiseal rectal tube.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Continues to improve; now on 2L NC.  CXR
   pending this AM
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Repeat abg to monitor for hypercarbia
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          Plan to diurese today in effort to improve RIGHT sided
   pleural effusion. No plan for thoracentesis today, but if oxygenation
   worsens would consider a therapeutic tap.
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Continue carvedilol and diuretics prn.  BP stable
   last 24 hours.  Has bilateral LE edema. Would consider restarting at
   home Spironlactone to avoid bolus effect of Lasix.
   -          Continue lisinopril and Carvedilol
   -          Monitor UOP and consider lasix to keep patient net negative
   500 cc to 1 L
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin yesterday.  Currently no
   evidence of toxicity. INR continues to be subtherapeutic.
   -          Continue coumadin at
 home dose today and monitor INR.
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline.  Initial
   presentation likely secondary to underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and her stool specimens were positive for c-diff colitis. She has been on Flagyl and Vancomycin for c-diff and shows improvement. She continues to have loose stool through a rectal tube. Her vital signs are stable, but she has a worsening pleural effusion on the right lung. She has a subtherapeutic INR, hypernatremia, and her sodium levels have resolved. She has bilateral lower extremity edema and is on diuretics for CHF. She is minimally responsive and unable to follow commands. Her neurological examination shows a downgoing plantar reflex on the left and upgoing on the right. She has trace upper extremity edema and 1+ lower extremity edema. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count. She has an elevated creatinine level and her kidney function is worsening. Her liver enzymes are within normal range. She is currently on multiple medications including Flagyl, Vancomycin, lasix, carvedilol, lisinopril, and Coumadin.

Potential Medical Complications:

   1. Resp : Patient's respiratory status stable off the ventilator but on
   exam she is having shallow breathing, RLL bronchial BS, likely
   compressive atelectasis in setting of large right pl effussion.  Will
   check ABG, will attempt 500 cc to 1000 cc negative, sit up in bed
   even OOB to chair, Role of tap is challenging as it is not clearly
   impacting her oxygenation, is likely due to fluid overload which should
   resolve with diuresis, and would require reversing INR (and fluid) to
   perform. In order to better assess risk benefit switch her to Venti
   mask and titrate Oi2 needs as we diurese today and hold off on tapping.
   2. Hemodynamics are stable. Digoxin restarted for rate control of Afib.
   3. INR: coming down slowly,

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis and respiratory distress. She has a history of C. diff sepsis, heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, CVA (stroke), respiratory failure, hypertension, pneumonia, and C. diff infection.

The patient's current vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C (98.2°F), a heart rate of 83 bpm with an irregular rhythm, a blood pressure ranging from 126/46mmHg to 159/72mmHg, a respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula. She is also on digoxin for rate control of atrial fibrillation.

Her laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, normal platelet count, elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

The patient is currently receiving various medications, including Coumadin, furosemide (Lasix), and lansoprazole (Prevacid). She has been diagnosed with compressive atelectasis due to a large right pleural effusion, and the plan is to attempt chest tube placement once her INR is reversed. She will also be positioned upright and given diuretics to manage fluid overload.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a chief complaint of sepsis and respiratory distress. She has a history of C. difficile infection, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, stroke, hypertension, pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia. 

The patient's current condition shows improving respiratory distress, with weaning off oxygen to 2 liters nasal cannula. Her INR is trending down, and Coumadin was restarted. She has been receiving diuretics, and chest physiotherapy is being considered due to the right lung collapse with effusion and atelectasis seen on the chest X-ray. 

Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 126/46 to 159/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92%. She is experiencing atrial flutter and has a central venous pressure of 8 mmHg. 

Laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 11.0 g/dL and leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.3 K/uL. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The chest X-ray shows right lung opacification, likely due to a combination of effusion and atelectasis. 

Assessment and Plan:
The patient's medical history includes heart failure, atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, C. difficile infection, stroke, hypertension, pneumonia, and community-acquired pneumonia. 

The respiratory condition is being managed by continuing diuresis, providing chest physiotherapy, and considering a thoracic ultrasound if the effusion is large. Hemodynamics are stable, and digoxin has been restarted for rate control of atrial fibrillation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that could arise include worsening respiratory distress due to the right lung collapse with effusion and atelectasis. There is also a risk of recurrent C. difficile infection, exacerbation of heart failure, and complications related to atrial fibrillation."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection, previous stroke, respiratory failure, hypertension, and community-acquired pneumonia. She is currently in the ICU due to sepsis and respiratory distress. Her current condition includes lower oxygen requirements but worsening right lung collapse with effusion and atelectasis on CXR. She has stable hemodynamics and has been started on diuretics, chest physical therapy, and considering extubation if US shows improvement. Digoxin has been restarted for rate control of atrial fibrillation. The remaining issues are as per the housestaff notes reviewed and discussed during rounds.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: The patient's worsening right lung collapse with effusion and atelectasis suggests a potential respiratory complication. This could lead to further respiratory distress and compromised oxygenation.
2. Cardiac Complications: Given the patient's history of heart failure and atrial fibrillation, there is a risk of cardiac complications such as worsening heart failure or arrhythmias.
3. Infection: The patient's history of Clostridium difficile infection indicates a potential ongoing infection, which can lead to sepsis and further complications.
4. Thromboembolic Events: Due to the patient's immobilization and medical conditions, there is a risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary"

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had
   several loose bowels since admission, and continues to have loose stool
   through Flexiseal rectal tube.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.
          -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
   [**1-5**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Continues to improve; now on 3L NC.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Repeat abg to monitor for hypercarbia
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          Plan to diurese today in effort to improve RIGHT sided
   pleural effusion.
   -          ? bronchoscopy for therapeutic/diagnostic post obs pna
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Continue carvedilol and diuretics prn.  BP stable
   last 24 hours.  Has bilateral LE edema. Would consider restarting at
   home Spironlactone to avoid bolus effect of Lasix.
   -          Continue lisinopril and Carvedilol
   -          Monitor UOP and consider lasix to keep patient net negative
   500 cc to 1 L
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin.  Currently no evidence
   of toxicity. Holding coumadin for possible procedure. INR continues to
   be subtherapeutic.
   -          Continue coumadin at
 home dose today and monitor INR.
   -          Restart coumadin if no procedure today
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6
   -          fluid bolus  PRN with goal UOP >50cc/hr
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Pt minimally interactive at baseline.  Initial
   presentation likely secondary to underlying infection.
   -          cont to monitor
   # FEN: Replete lytes prn.

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, C-diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with diverticulitis/colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to improve but requires supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations > 92%. There is a risk of hypoxia if the oxygen supply is insufficient. Non-invasive ventilation may be considered if hypoxic, and daily CXR should be repeated to monitor progress.

2. CHF/Hemodynamics: The patient's blood pressure is stable, but they have bilateral LE edema. There is a risk of worsening heart failure if diuretics are not effective or if fluid overload occurs.

3. C-diff colitis: The patient is currently on Flagyl/Vanc for c-diff. Loose stools have persisted since admission. It is important to continue monitoring the abdomen exam and ensure an adequate course of antibiotics (likely at least 2 weeks).

4. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but resolved with free water via PEG tube. Continued monitoring and fluid management is necessary to prevent further electrolyte imbalances.

5. Unresponsiveness: The patient's initial presentation may be secondary to underlying infection."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG placement, CHF, and C. difficile infection. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to pneumonia. Her stool specimens tested positive for C. difficile colitis, and her CT scan shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. She has been receiving treatment for C. difficile with Flagyl and Vanc. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient continues to improve but is still at risk of hypoxia and hypercarbia. Non-invasive ventilation may be considered if hypoxic, and a therapeutic thoracentesis may be considered if oxygenation worsens.
2. CHF/Hemodynamics: The patient has stable blood pressure but presents with bilateral lower extremity edema. Diuretics may be continued to manage this, and there is a plan to restart spironolactone to avoid the bolus effect of Lasix.
3. Atrial fibrillation and subtherapeutic INR: The patient restarted digoxin yesterday without evidence of toxicity, but her INR remains subtherapeutic. She will continue on Coumadin at home dose and will be monitored for INR levels.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with free water administration via PEG tube. She will continue with free water flushes and aim for a urine output of more than 50"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with several health conditions. The patient's chief complaint is colitis, which is an inflammation of the colon. The patient also has a history of heart failure (diastolic), atrial fibrillation, impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), benign hypertension, and community-acquired pneumonia.

The patient's vital signs indicate a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 97 bpm with an irregular rhythm (atrial fibrillation), blood pressure of 85/37 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on a nasal cannula.

The patient has been given lasix for fluid management, lansoprazole for acid reflux, and various other medications. The patient has undergone several procedures including bronchoscopy and chest X-ray, which showed white-out of the right lung with minimal improvement with chest PT and initial diuresis.

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. The blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 106-162 mg/dL. Other lab results indicate elevated levels of creatinine, lactate, and lactic acid, as well as low levels of albumin, potassium, and magnesium.

The patient's fluid balance shows a negative"

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 1 [**12-22**]).  Pt has had
   several loose bowels since admission, and continues to have loose stool
   through Flexiseal rectal tube.
   -          continue to monitor abdomen exam.

   [**1-5**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Continues to improve; now on 3L NC.  CXR shows
   interval improvement in RIGHT sided opacity since yesterday.
   -          Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >
   92%
   -          Repeat abg to monitor for hypercarbia given somnolence on
   exam
   -          Consider Non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic
   -          daily cxr
   -          Plan to diurese today in effort to improve RIGHT sided
   pleural effusion. Net negative 500 cc to 1 L.
   -          Hold off on  bronchoscopy for therapeutic/diagnostic post

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. Stool specimens are positive for C-diff colitis, and CT scan shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has been on Flagyl/Vanc for C-diff and is continuing the medication for a minimum of two weeks. She is improving on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula and will continue to have daily chest X-rays. The patient's respiratory failure has shown improvement since yesterday. There is a plan to diurese today to improve right-sided pleural effusion. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema and is currently NPO for a planned bronchoscopy. Her vital signs are stable, and she is on carvedilol and diuretics as needed. The patient's INR is subtherapeutic, so she will restart coumadin today and monitor INR. She is also restarted on digoxin. The patient's hypernatremia has resolved with free water via PEG tube, and she will continue with free water flushes to maintain urine output greater than 50cc/hr.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C-diff colitis: The patient is already on Flagyl/Vanc for this condition and will continue the medication for a minimum of two weeks. Monitoring the"

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions. They have a history of allergies to penicillins and erythromycin. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 116/54 to 162/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is extubated and awake. They have atrial fibrillation and a central venous pressure of 2 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an intake of 2,254 mL and output of 2,874 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -620 mL. The patient is receiving various medications and treatments, including furosemide, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. diff colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C. diff colitis, which is a bacterial infection caused by Clostridium difficile. This condition can lead to severe diarrhea and dehydration if not properly managed.
2. Sepsis: The patient is also diagnosed with sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. It can lead to organ failure and death if not treated promptly.
3. Pulmonary edema: The patient previously had pulmonary edema, which is a buildup of fluid in the lungs. This can cause difficulty in breathing and can be"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU. They have a history of penicillin and erythromycin allergies. The patient has been receiving various medications, including furosemide, vancomycin, and metronidazole. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.1 C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 116/54 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient is on nasal cannula for respiratory support.

The patient has several medical conditions, including C. diff colitis, sepsis, pulmonary edema (resolved), right atelectasis (improved), atrial fibrillation (rate controlled), and a recent cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiparesis and aphasia. The patient also requires nutritional support through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).

The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, and troponin-T levels. The blood glucose levels are within normal range, but the electrolytes show mild hypokalemia and hypernatremia. Imaging shows improved aeration in the right lung.

Plan:
- Continue PO vancomycin and iv flagyl for C. diff colitis.
- Monitor I/O and continue net diuresis if CVP remains low.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and has positive stool specimens for c-diff colitis. Her CT scan shows signs consistent with diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has been treated with Flagyl and Vanc for c-diff and continues to have loose stool. She is currently on 3L NC and showing improvement in her right-sided opacity on the CXR. Her respiratory support includes supplemental oxygen via facemask, with plans to continue monitoring and consider non-invasive ventilation if hypoxic. The patient also has CHF with bilateral LE edema, and her hemodynamics are stable. She will continue with carvedilol and diuretics as needed, considering restarting Spironlactone at home. The patient has atrial fibrillation with a subtherapeutic INR, for which digoxin has been restarted. Her hypernatremia has resolved with free water via PEG tube. The patient's unresponsiveness is likely secondary to underlying infection. Possible transfer to the floor is being considered for her disposition.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if she becomes hypoxic or develops further complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 7, day one [**12-22**]).  Pt
   continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube.
    -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course. (likely [**12-22**]
 [**1-5**])
   .
   # Respiratory failure:   Using accessory muscles this AM despite being
   94-99% 02 sat on 3L NC.  CXR shows interval worsening of RIGHT sided
   opacity.
   - aggressive Chest PT
   -OOB to chair if possible
   -hold off on lasix as patient has low BP and CXR more concerning for
   collapse than effusion.
   -Continue supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations > 92%
   -  Hold off on  bronchoscopy for therapeutic/diagnostic post obs pna
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Continue carvedilol and diuretics prn.  BP stable
   last 24 hours.  Has bilateral LE edema. Would consider restarting at
   home Spironlactone to avoid bolus effect of Lasix.
   -          Hold lisinopril and Carvedilol [**2-8**] low BP
   -          Monitor UOP, goal even today .
   # Afib/Supratherapeutic INR- Restarted digoxin.  Currently no evidence
   of toxicity. Holding coumadin for possible procedure. INR continues to
   be subtherapeutic.
   -          Restarted coumadin yesterday and INR down to 1.3 (from 1.4),
   will continue with same dose today and consider increasing tomorrow..
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6
   .
   # Unresponsiveness:   Patient is at baseline.

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. Stool specimens are positive for C. diff colitis, and a CT scan shows diverticulitis/colitis. The patient is currently on Flagyl and Vancomycin for C. diff, and her abdominal examination will be monitored. She is also on supplemental oxygen via facemask for saturations >92% and will have repeat ABG to monitor for hypercarbia given somnolence on exam. Daily chest X-ray will be performed. The patient has bilateral lower extremity edema and is being diuresed to improve right-sided pleural effusion. She is also on carvedilol and diuretics as needed for CHF management. Lisinopril and carvedilol will be continued, and UOP will be monitored with consideration for Lasix to keep the patient net negative 500 cc to 1 L. Diamox with Lasix may be considered given elevated bicarbonate. Digoxin has been restarted for atrial fibrillation, and Coumadin will be restarted today with monitoring of INR.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual with several medical conditions and complications. The key findings and potential medical complications are as follows:

1. Heart Failure (CHF): The patient has a history of diastolic heart failure, which can lead to fluid accumulation in the body and subsequent symptoms such as shortness of breath, edema, and fatigue.

2. Atrial Fibrillation (AFib): The patient is experiencing atrial fibrillation, an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of blood clots, stroke, and other heart-related complications.

3. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which may be due to immobility, poor nutrition, or other factors. This increases the risk of pressure ulcers and skin infections.

4. Clostridium difficile Infection (C. diff): The patient is diagnosed with C. diff infection, a bacterial infection that causes severe diarrhea and colitis. It is often associated with antibiotic use and can lead to complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

5. History of CVA (Stroke): The patient has a history of ischemic stroke, which can result in neurological deficits and increased risk of complications like pneumonia and deep vein thrombosis.

6. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which can be caused by various factors such as pneumonia, heart failure, or lung injury. This can lead to inadequate oxygenation and ventilation"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with multiple medical conditions and complications. They have been admitted to the ICU for ongoing management. The patient has a history of encephalopathy, allergies to penicillins and erythromycin base, and recent antibiotic use including metronidazole and vancomycin.

The patient experienced a transient episode of hypotension that responded to intravenous fluids. Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate ranging from 69-104 bpm, blood pressure between 99/47-139/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 96%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation.

Physical examination reveals the patient to be overweight or obese, with no acute distress. They have poor dentition and an endotracheal tube in place. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse, regular heart rhythm, and no murmurs or signs of heart failure. Peripheral pulses are present and symmetric. Respiratory examination is clear bilaterally, with no crackles or wheezes. Abdominal examination reveals soft, non-tender bowel sounds with no distension or tenderness. Extremities show no cyanosis or clubbing, and the skin is warm without rash or jaundice. Neurologic examination shows the patient to be attentive, oriented, and following simple commands.

   .
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 8, day one [**12-22**]).  Pt
   continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube.
    -      Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will require
   longer course.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:   Had to be re-intubated last night, likely [**2-8**]
   mucous plugging given acute presentation and difficulty bag-mask
   ventilation.  Once on machine, lung aeration much improved.  Suctioning
   also continuing to help.
   - Bronchoscopy this AM for diagnosis (? endobronchial lesion/PNA) and
   perhaps therapeutic (? Help clear secretion)
   - after bronch, wean vent as tolerated
   - daily wake up
   - wean levophed
   -ABG after bronch
   .
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given hypotension, holding lisinopril, carvedilol,
   lasix.  Patient given IVF last night so will monitor for Volume
   overload today.
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Held coumadin last night given procedure this AM.
   INR low 1.3 (goal [**2-9**])
   -          Will give coumadin after bronch.
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6
    .
   # FEN: Tube feeds held at MN for Bronch, replete lytes prn.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. Stool specimens are positive for C-diff colitis, and CT a/p shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has been on Flagyl/Vanc for C-diff and has had loose stool through a Flexiseal rectal tube.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient had to be re-intubated due to acute hypoxia and difficulty with bag-mask ventilation. Lung aeration improved after intubation, and bronchoscopy is planned for diagnosis and possible therapeutic intervention. The goal is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and monitor for mucous plugging.
2. C-diff Colitis: The patient has ongoing symptoms of C-diff colitis despite receiving Flagyl/Vanc. She continues to have loose stools, and her treatment may need to be extended beyond the minimum two-week course.
3. CHF/Hemodynamics: The patient is hypotensive, so lisinopril, carvedilol, and lasix are being held. IV fluids were given last night, and the patient will be monitored for volume overload today.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is on digoxin and had INR levels checked"

   Assessment and Plan
   .
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:   Had to be re-intubated last night, likely [**2-8**]
   mucous plugging given acute presentation and difficulty bag-mask
   ventilation.  Once on machine, lung aeration much improved.  Suctioning
   also continuing to help. Bronch this morning did not show any
   endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing.   Underlying
   reason for increased secretions is unclear (though inability to clear
   secretions is [**2-8**] CVA).  Given her increasing leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, will cover her for VAP:
   -empiric Vanco/Cefepime (patient penicillin allergic)
   - after bronch, wean vent as tolerated starting with decreasing Fi02
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Hypotension: Cause unclear, happened after intubation which made
   medication-related the most likely however her inability to wean
   overnight makes this less likely.  Sepsis is a possibility given her
   WBC count and hypothermia. Abdomen benign so unlikely complication of
   C. Diff.
   -u/a and urine cultures
   -blood cultures
   -Bolus IVF today then try to wean levophed
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 8, day one [**12-22**]).  Pt
   continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given hypotension, holding lisinopril, carvedilol,
   lasix.  Patient given IVF last night so will monitor for Volume
   overload today.
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Held coumadin last night given procedure this AM.
   INR low 1.3 (goal [**2-9**])
   -          restart coumadin, continue digoxin
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6
    .
   # FEN: Restart tube feeds, replete lytes prn.

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) / dementia status post percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), fibromyalgia, congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. Stool specimens are positive for C. diff colitis, and a computed tomography (CT) scan shows findings consistent with diverticulitis/colitis.

The patient's current medical complications include respiratory failure, hypotension, C. diff colitis, CHF/hemodynamics, atrial fibrillation (afib), hypernatremia, and feeding intolerance.

The patient's respiratory failure is characterized by acute hypoxia, difficulty bag-mask ventilation, and re-intubation. Bronchial suctioning has improved lung aeration. No endobronchial lesion obstructing the airway was found. The underlying cause of increased secretions is unclear, but inability to clear secretions due to CVA is suspected. The patient is being covered for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with empiric vancomycin and cefepime.

Hypotension occurred after intubation and could be medication-related or due to sepsis. The patient's white blood cell count and hypothermia suggest sepsis as a"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. Stool specimens are positive for C-diff colitis, and CT a/p shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. 

She has been on Flagyl/Vanc for C-diff for 7 days and continues to have loose stools. The plan is to continue treatment for a minimum of 2 weeks. 

The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, using accessory muscles and requiring supplemental oxygen. CXR shows worsening right-sided opacity, indicating possible pneumonia or lung collapse. 

For CHF/hemodynamics, the patient will continue with carvedilol and diuretics as needed. She is currently stable with low blood pressure, and her bilateral lower extremity edema suggests fluid overload. 

The patient has atrial fibrillation with a supratherapeutic INR, so digoxin has been restarted, and Coumadin has been held for a possible procedure. 

She also has hypernatremia, which was resolved with free water via PEG tube.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and has positive stool specimens for C-diff colitis. Her CT a/p shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has been on Flagyl/Vanc for c-diff and continues to have loose stools through a rectal tube. She is also experiencing respiratory failure and is being supported with supplemental oxygen. Her chest X-ray shows worsening right-sided opacity, indicating a possible lung infection or collapse. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has bilateral lower extremity edema, which suggests congestive heart failure. Her INR levels are subtherapeutic, and she has been restarted on digoxin. Her sodium levels were elevated, but have resolved with free water administration through the PEG tube.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status continues to deteriorate, as indicated by the worsening right-sided opacity on the chest X-ray. This suggests a possible lung infection or collapse, which can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential need for intubation or mechanical ventilation.

2. C-diff Colitis: The patient's stool specimens are positive for C-diff, indicating an active infection. This can cause severe diarrhea and may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances."

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been treated for C-diff colitis and is currently on Flagyl/Vanc. The patient continues to have loose stools through a rectal tube. The patient's respiratory status has worsened, with increased use of accessory muscles and low oxygen saturation despite supplemental oxygen. Chest X-ray shows worsening right-sided opacity. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but there is concern for fluid overload with bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient has atrial fibrillation and a subtherapeutic INR, but no evidence of digoxin toxicity. The patient's sodium levels were initially elevated but have resolved. The patient remains unresponsive and is being monitored in the ICU.

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status has worsened, indicating a potential complication of respiratory failure. The worsening right-sided opacity on chest X-ray suggests a possible infection or consolidation in the lung, which could be contributing to the respiratory failure.

2. C-diff colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with C-diff colitis and is currently being treated with Flagyl/Vanc. However, the patient continues to have loose stools through a rectal tube, indicating that the infection may not be fully resolved. This could lead"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; C. diff colitis, sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to significant right atalectasis due
   to secretions & mucus plug.  Now improved, with evidence for
   reexpansion of right lung.  Bronchoscopy without evidence for
   endobronchial lesion.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.
   HYPOTENSION -- possible related to post-op pharmacological effects, but
   concern for hypovolemia or sepsis.  Monitor on empirical
   antimicrobials.  Limit meds that contribute to hypotension.  Possible
   evolution of pneumonia (due to poor ability to handle secretions).
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- resolved.  Net diuresed.
   C. DIFF COLITIS -- clinically improving.  Recurrent.  Continue PO
   vanco, iv flagyl.  Check KUB to assess for colonic
   RIGHT ATALECTASIS -- recurrent.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm
   paralysis.  Continue vigorous pulmonary toilet.  Consider bronchoscopy
   if unable to resolve with chest physiotherapy (but would likely require
   intubation).
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Monitor.  continue coumadin.
   s/p CVA -- right hemiparesis, aphasia.  Clinically stable.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Plan monitor I/O.  Continue net diuresis
   if CVP remains low.
   ALKALOSIS -- metabolic.  Imporved.  Provide Cl if continue diuresis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure. The patient was intubated for respiratory distress and hypoxemia. There are several potential medical complications that can arise in this case:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is on mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing pneumonia. Measures should be taken to prevent VAP, such as maintaining head-of-bed elevation, performing regular mouth care, and ensuring daily wake-up calls.

2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots. Prophylactic measures like compression stockings and systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin should be implemented.

3. Stress ulcers: Critical illness can lead to stress ulcers, which may result in gastrointestinal bleeding. Prophylactic therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) should be continued.

4. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of C. difficile colitis, which is an infection commonly associated with antibiotic use. Monitoring for symptoms and continuing appropriate treatment is important.

5. Fluid balance: The patient has mild hypovolemia, and careful monitoring of fluid balance is necessary. Managing I/O (inputs and outputs) and considering diuresis if the central venous pressure (CVP) remains low may be required.

6. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; C. diff colitis, sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to significant right atalectasis due
   to secretions & mucus plug.  Now improved, with evidence for
   reexpansion of right lung.  Bronchoscopy without evidence for
   endobronchial lesion.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.
   HYPOTENSION -- possible related to post-op pharmacological effects, but
   concern for hypovolemia or sepsis.  Monitor on empirical
   antimicrobials.  Limit meds that contribute to hypotension.  Possible
   evolution of pneumonia (due to poor ability to handle secretions).
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- resolved.  Net diuresed.
   C. DIFF COLITIS -- clinically improving.  Recurrent.  Continue PO
   vanco, iv flagyl.  Check KUB to assess for colonic
   RIGHT ATALECTASIS -- recurrent.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm
   paralysis.  Continue vigorous pulmonary toilet.  Consider bronchoscopy
   if unable to resolve with chest physiotherapy (but would likely require
   intubation).
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Monitor.  continue coumadin.
   s/p CVA -- right hemiparesis, aphasia.  Clinically stable.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Plan monitor I/O.  Continue net diuresis
   if CVP remains low.
   ALKALOSIS -- metabolic.  Imporved.  Provide Cl if continue diuresis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is critically ill and admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. They were intubated due to respiratory distress and hypoxemia. The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and vancomycin. They are currently on mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The patient's vital signs show mild hypotension and tachycardia, but their oxygen saturation is within normal range. Their review of systems is unremarkable except for respiratory symptoms. The physical examination reveals no acute distress or signs of abuse. The patient has a cervical WNL lymph node and normal breath sounds bilaterally. 

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory failure - attributed to significant right atelectasis due to secretions & mucus plug. Now improved, with evidence for reexpansion of right lung. Bronchoscopy without evidence for endobronchial lesion. Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis. Continue mechanical ventilation.
2. Hypotension - possible related to post-op pharmacological effects, but concern for hypovolemia or sepsis. Monitor on empirical antimicrobials. Limit meds that contribute to hypotension. Possible evolution of pneumonia (due to poor ability to handle secretions).
3. Pulmonary edema - resolved. Net diuresed.
4. C. diff colitis - clinically improving. Recurrent. Continue PO vanco, iv flagyl. Check KUB"

   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:   Had to be re-intubated last night, likely [**2-8**]
   mucous plugging given acute presentation and difficulty bag-mask
   ventilation.  Once on machine, lung aeration much improved.  Suctioning
   also continuing to help. Bronch this morning did not show any
   endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing.   Underlying
   reason for increased secretions is unclear (though inability to clear
   secretions is [**2-8**] CVA).  Given her increasing leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, will cover her for VAP:
   -empiric Vanco/Cefepime (patient penicillin allergic)
   - after bronch, wean vent as tolerated starting with decreasing Fi02
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Hypotension: Cause unclear, happened after intubation which made
   medication-related the most likely however her inability to wean
   overnight makes this less likely.  Sepsis is a possibility given her
   WBC count and hypothermia. Abdomen benign so unlikely complication of
   C. Diff.
   -u/a and urine cultures
   -blood cultures
   -Bolus IVF today then try to wean levophed
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 8, day one [**12-22**]).  Pt
   continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.
   .
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given hypotension, holding lisinopril, carvedilol,
   lasix.  Patient given IVF last night so will monitor for Volume
   overload today.
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Held coumadin last night given procedure this AM.
   INR low 1.3 (goal [**2-9**])
   -          restart coumadin, continue digoxin

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with diverticulitis/colitis.

The patient has experienced several medical complications, including respiratory failure, hypotension, atrial fibrillation (AF), impaired skin integrity, Clostridium difficile infection (C diff), hypertension, benign; pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP), and hypernatremia. 

The patient was re-intubated last night due to respiratory failure and mucous plugging. Bronchoscopy did not show any endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing. The underlying reason for increased secretions is unclear, but the inability to clear secretions may be related to a previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA). 

The patient's hypotension occurred after intubation, but the cause is unclear. Sepsis is a possibility given the patient's elevated white blood cell count and hypothermia. 

The patient has been diagnosed with C diff colitis and is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin.

   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with

    # Respiratory failure:   Had to be re-intubated last night, likely [**2-8**]
   mucous plugging given acute presentation and difficulty bag-mask
   ventilation.  Once on machine, lung aeration much improved.  Suctioning
   also continuing to help. Bronch this morning did not show any
   endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing.   Underlying
   reason for increased secretions is unclear (though inability to clear
   secretions is [**2-8**] CVA).  Given her increasing leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, will cover her for VAP:
   -empiric Vanco/Cefepime (patient penicillin allergic)
   - after bronch, wean vent as tolerated starting with decreasing Fi02
   - VAP precautions

   # Hypotension: Cause unclear, happened after intubation which made
   medication-related the most likely however her inability to wean
   overnight makes this less likely.  Sepsis is a possibility given her

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely due to mucous plugging secondary to recent pneumonia diagnosis. She was re-intubated last night and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Bronchoscopic evaluation did not reveal any endobronchial lesion. The patient's underlying reason for increased secretions is unclear, but it could be related to her CVA. She has increasing leukocytosis, increased secretions, and recent intubation, so she is being covered for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with empiric Vancomycin and Cefepime.

The patient also has hypotension of unknown cause, which occurred after intubation. Her inability to wean overnight suggests that medication-related hypotension is less likely. Sepsis is a possibility given her elevated WBC count and hypothermia. Blood cultures have been obtained, and she will receive a bolus IVF today before attempting to wean Levophed.

The patient has c-diff colitis, for which she is receiving Flagyl and Vanc. She continues to have loose stool through the Flexiseal rectal tube, so she will be on PO Flagyl/Vanc for a minimum of two weeks, with a likely longer course.

The patient has acute diastolic heart failure,"

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), congestive heart failure (CHF), Clostridium difficile infection (C diff), who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She also has a recent diagnosis of pneumonia, positive stool specimens for C diff colitis, and a CT scan consistent with diverticulitis/colitis.

The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to mucous plugging, as she had to be re-intubated on 12/30 and there was difficulty with bag-mask ventilation. A bronchoscopic evaluation on 12/31 did not show any endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing. Given her increased secretions, recent intubation, and leukocytosis, she is being covered for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Her chest X-ray shows increased opacity in the right lower lobe, suggesting worsening of her condition. She is currently on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and VAP precautions.

The cause of her hypotension is unclear, but sepsis is a possibility given her elevated white blood cell count and hypothermia on 12/31. She is being weaned off levophed today, and her urine, blood, and sputum cultures are pending. 

The patient has been diagnosed with C diff colitis and has been on Flagyl/Vanc for"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:   Had to be re-intubated [**12-30**], likely [**2-8**]
   mucous plugging given acute presentation and difficulty bag-mask
   ventilation. Bronch [**12-31**] did not show any endobronchial lesion that
   could have been obstructing.   Underlying reason for increased
   secretions is unclear (though inability to clear secretions is [**2-8**]
   CVA).  Given her increased leukocytosis, increased secretions and
   recent intubation, covering her for VAP. Also, today CXR looks worse
   with incr opacity of RLL
   -empiric Vanco. Cefepime switched to meropenem today.
   - cont CPAP today as tolerated
   - VAP precautions
   .
   # Hypotension: Cause unclear.  Sepsis is a possibility given her WBC
   count and hypothermia [**12-31**]. Abdomen benign so unlikely complication of
   C. Diff.
   -f/u urine, blood, sputum cultures
   -weaning levophed today

   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 10, day one [**12-22**]).
   Pt continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.

   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given hypotension, holding lisinopril, carvedilol,
   lasix.  Patient given IVF last night so will monitor for Volume
   overload today.
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  INR low 1.6 (goal [**2-9**])
   -          cont coumadin, continue digoxin
   .
   # Hypernatremia:  Resolved with free water via PEG tube.
   -          continue free water flushes to 150 q 6

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been diagnosed with pneumonia and has positive stool specimens for C-diff colitis. Her CT scan shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient had to be re-intubated due to respiratory failure and difficulty bag-mask ventilation. She is currently on CPAP as tolerated, with VAP precautions. The underlying reason for increased secretions is unclear, but it could be related to a CVA. The patient's leukocytosis, recent intubation, and worsening CXR with increased opacity in the right lower lobe suggest covering for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's hypotension is likely due to sepsis, and her abdomen appears benign. She continues to have loose stool through a rectal tube despite being on Flagyl/Vanc for C-diff. The patient is also being treated for CHF/hemodynamics and atrial fibrillation. Her sodium levels were previously elevated but have resolved with free water via PEG tube. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is pending further evaluation.

    # Respiratory failure:  Interval improvement in CXR, but patient
   unable to stay on PS and back on CMV overnight to rest.  Had to be
   re-intubated [**12-30**], likely [**2-8**] mucous plugging given acute presentation
   and difficulty bag-mask ventilation. Bronch [**12-31**] did not show any
   endobronchial lesion that could have been obstructing.   Underlying
   reason for increased secretions is unclear (though inability to clear
   secretions is [**2-8**] CVA).  Given her increased leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, possible pneumonia, need to cover for
    VAP.
   -Continue Vanco, Meropenem. .
   - PS  today as tolerated
   - VAP precautions
   - Will try to keep net negative for optimization of respiratory status.
   .
   # Rash: Appearance consistenent with drug rash,  most likely cefepime
   as patient has known penicillin allergy.
   -benadryl PRN for symptoms
   -d/c
d cefepime yesterday, expect rash to last a few days.

   # Hypotension: resolved.

   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 11, day one [**12-22**]).
   Pt continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube but
   abdominal exam is benign, no signs of blood in stool or other concerns
   for worsening colitis..
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.

   #Coagulopathy: INR therapeutic but PTT too high.  Possibly secondary to
   SQ heparin.
   -hold SQ heparin and re-check PTT in AM
   -INR at goal, continue coumadin

   # Hyponatremia:  Patient previously with hypernatremia, was given free
   water boluses, now sodium is 130.
   -hold free water boluses, check sodium in AM
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given recent hypotension, holding lisinopril,
   carvedilol, lasix. Patient has been net positive for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will
   monitor.
   -Goal net even to -1L today.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient was intubated and diagnosed with pneumonia. She had a positive stool specimen for C-diff colitis and a CT scan showing diverticulitis/colitis. The patient's respiratory status improved with the use of CMV and she was extubated. However, she required re-intubation due to acute presentation and difficulty with bag-mask ventilation. The underlying reason for increased secretions is unclear. The patient has leukocytosis and recent intubation, so coverage for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is necessary. 

The patient has a known penicillin allergy and developed a drug rash consistent with cefepime, so she was switched to [**Last Name (un) **]. Her hypotension resolved, but she has ongoing issues with C-diff colitis and hyponatremia. The patient's coagulopathy is being managed with Coumadin and the hold on SQ heparin. Her CHF/hemodynamics are being monitored, and she is on digoxin and Coumadin for atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could be due to pneumonia, difficulty clearing secretions, or mucous plugging. She"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; C. diff colitis, sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to significant right atalectasis due
   to secretions & mucus plug.  Now improved, with evidence for
   reexpansion of right lung.  Bronchoscopy without evidence for
   endobronchial lesion.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider Trach if secretions
   remain problem and acceptable to patient, if unable to proceed to
   extubation or if fails extubation.
   RIGHT ATALECTASIS -- recurrent.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm
   paralysis.  Continue vigorous pulmonary toilet.  Consider bronchoscopy
   if unable to resolve with chest physiotherapy (but would likely require
   intubation).
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Possible sepsis.  Monitor MAP.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- resolved.  Net diuresed. Euvolemic.
   C. DIFF COLITIS -- clinically improving.  Recurrent.  Continue PO
   vanco, iv flagyl.  Check KUB to assess for colonic
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Monitor.  continue coumadin.
   s/p CVA -- right hemiparesis, aphasia.  Clinically stable.
   COAGULOPATHY
 coumadin, antimicrobials and nutritional effects.  Hold
   heparin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Plan monitor I/O.  Continue net diuresis
   if CVP remains low.
   ALKALOSIS -- metabolic.  Imporved.  Provide Cl if continue diuresis.

","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure. They are intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has experienced several medical complications including right atelectasis, C. diff colitis, sepsis, and coagulopathy. The patient's condition remains unstable, and they require ongoing management in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory system is severely compromised, leading to respiratory failure. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. There is a concern for tracheostomy if secretions continue to be problematic and if extubation or weaning from mechanical ventilation fails.

2. Right Atelectasis: The patient has recurrent right atelectasis, which is likely due to underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis. Vigorous pulmonary toilet is being continued, and bronchoscopy may be considered if chest physiotherapy is ineffective.

3. C. Difficile Colitis: The patient has C. difficile colitis, which is improving but recurrent. The patient is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole.

4. Sepsis: The patient may have had sepsis, possibly related to C. difficile colitis or other sources. The patient's hypotension has resolved, but monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) is ongoing.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient has coagulopathy, which may be"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; C. diff colitis, sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to significant right atalectasis due
   to secretions & mucus plug.  Now improved, with evidence for
   reexpansion of right lung.  Bronchoscopy without evidence for
   endobronchial lesion.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider Trach if secretions
   remain problem and acceptable to patient, if unable to proceed to
   extubation or if fails extubation.
   RIGHT ATALECTASIS -- recurrent.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm
   paralysis.  Continue vigorous pulmonary toilet.  Consider bronchoscopy
   if unable to resolve with chest physiotherapy (but would likely require
   intubation).
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Possible sepsis.  Monitor MAP.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- resolved.  Net diuresed. Euvolemic.
   C. DIFF COLITIS -- clinically improving.  Recurrent.  Continue PO
   vanco, iv flagyl.  Check KUB to assess for colonic
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Monitor.  continue coumadin.
   s/p CVA -- right hemiparesis, aphasia.  Clinically stable.
   COAGULOPATHY
 coumadin, antimicrobials and nutritional effects.  Hold
   heparin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Plan monitor I/O.  Continue net diuresis
   if CVP remains low.
   ALKALOSIS -- metabolic.  Imporved.  Provide Cl if continue diuresis.

   Total time spent: 50 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient's chief complaint is respiratory failure. The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient experienced an episode of tachycardia last night, possibly related to agitation. Vasopressors were discontinued yesterday. The patient developed a rash on the torso, arms, and legs, and cefopime was discontinued. 

The patient has a history of penicillin allergies and unknown allergies to erythromycin base. The last dose of antibiotics was cefopime at 10:00 AM, vancomycin at 2:00 AM, metronidazole at 2:00 AM, and meropenem at 8:30 AM. The patient is currently receiving fentanyl infusion and other ICU medications including Coumadin (warfarin) at 4:15 PM, fentanyl at 5:05 PM, and heparin sodium (prophylaxis) at 10:00 PM.

The patient's medical history, social history, family history, and review of systems are unchanged from admission except for the noted above. The patient has no acute distress, is overweight, and has no pain. 

On physical examination, the patient's general appearance is unremarkable. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate of 100 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure of 110/42 mmHg (83/28-169/61 mmHg), respiratory rate of 10 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. The patient's CVP is 4 mmHg, and the total input/output balance is 4,844 mL in and 1,015 mL out with a difference of 3,829 mL.

The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube, CPAP/PSV mode on the ventilator, set Vt of 400 mL, RR set at 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, and an RSBI of 31. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, PCO2 of 52 mmHg, PO2 of 98 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, and base excess of -2 mEq/L. The patient's Ve is 5.3 L/min.

The patient's neurological examination shows no acute changes, and the rest of the physical examination findings are unremarkable.

The patient's laboratory results show a WBC count of 21.1 thousand/mm3, Hct of 34.3%, platelet count of 348 thousand/mm3, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, TCO2 of 39 mmHg, glucose level of 162 mg/dL, and other lab values within normal limits.

The assessment and plan include respiratory failure"

   Assessment and Plan
   Respiratory failure; C. diff colitis, sepsis.
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- attributed to significant right atalectasis due
   to secretions & mucus plug.  Now improved, with evidence for
   reexpansion of right lung.  Bronchoscopy without evidence for
   endobronchial lesion.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm paralysis.
   Continue mechanical ventilation.  Need to consider Trach if secretions
   remain problem and acceptable to patient.
   RIGHT ATALECTASIS -- recurrent.  Underlying right hemidiaphragm
   paralysis.  Continue vigorous pulmonary toilet.  Consider bronchoscopy
   if unable to resolve with chest physiotherapy (but would likely require
   intubation).
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Possible sepsis.  Monitor MAP.
   PULMONARY EDEMA -- resolved.  Net diuresed. Euvolemic.
   C. DIFF COLITIS -- clinically improving.  Recurrent.  Continue PO
   vanco, iv flagyl.  Check KUB to assess for colonic
   A-FIB -- good rate control.  Monitor.  continue coumadin.
   s/p CVA -- right hemiparesis, aphasia.  Clinically stable.
   COAGULOPATHY
 coumadin, antimicrobials and nutritional effects.  Hold
   heparin.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia, mild.  Plan monitor I/O.  Continue net diuresis
   if CVP remains low.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. The patient has a history of respiratory failure, possibly due to secretions and a mucus plug causing right atelectasis. The underlying cause of this atelectasis is right hemidiaphragm paralysis. The patient also has hypotension, which has resolved but may be related to sepsis. There is evidence of pulmonary edema, which has also resolved. The patient is being treated for C. diff colitis with oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. The patient is also experiencing atrial fibrillation with good rate control and is on Coumadin. The patient had a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) resulting in right hemiparesis and aphasia. There is a concern for coagulopathy due to Coumadin, antimicrobials, and nutritional effects. The patient's nutritional support includes tube feeding through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The patient's fluid status shows mild hypovolemia, and careful monitoring of intake and output is planned. The patient's metabolic alkalosis has improved, and chloride supplementation may be required if diuresis continues. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is critically ill and currently dependent on mechanical ventilation. There is a"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:  Given her increased leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, possible pneumonia we are covering
   for  VAP. Patient now stable on PS.  Wanted to make her net negative
   before extubation, but patient becomes borderline hypotensive with
   lasix.
   -Continue Vanco, Meropenem.
   - PS  today as tolerated
   - VAP precautions
   - f/u CXR
   -Goal is  net negative 1L for optimization of respiratory status.
   .
   # Rash: Appearance consistenent with drug rash,  most likely cefepime
   as patient has known penicillin allergy.  Unchanged since yesterday
   -benadryl PRN for symptoms
   -d/c
d cefepime yesterday, expect rash to last a few days.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with boderline hypotension (SBPs 86-90s) after
   lasix diursesis, stable, not tachycardic.
   -bolus for SBP<85
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 12, day one [**12-22**]).
   Pt continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube but
   abdominal exam is benign, no signs of blood in stool or other concerns
   for worsening colitis.  Family brought in probiotics.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.
   - probiotics via PEG.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: PTT was too high with SQ heparin, normalized with 1 day
   off.
   -restart SQ heparin at lower dose and re-check PTT in PM
   -INR at goal, continue coumadin
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Patient previously with hypernatremia, now
   hyponatremia x 2 days, continued after stopping free water boluses.
   -check urine lytes
   -continue to hold free water boluses, check sodium in PM
   .
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given recent hypotension, holding lisinopril,
   carvedilol, lasix. Patient has been net positive for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will
   monitor.
   -Goal net even to -1L today.
   -Gently Lasix if needed (20IV rather than 40)
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  INR at goal
   -          cont coumadin, continue digoxin

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy), fib (fibrosis), CHF (congestive heart failure), and c-diff (Clostridium difficile infection). The patient presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, along with recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool specimens positive for C diff colitis and CT a/p consistent with diverticulitis/colitis.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated due to respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. There is a possibility of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the physician is covering for this by continuing antibiotics and implementing VAP precautions.

2. Rash: The patient developed a drug rash consistent with cefepime, as she has a known penicillin allergy. The rash is expected to last a few days, and she is given Benadryl as needed for symptoms.

3. Hypotension: The patient experienced borderline hypotension (SBPs 86-90s) after lasix diuresis. The physician plans to give boluses for SBP <85 and will continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure.

4. C Diff Colitis: The patient has been treated for C diff colitis with Flagyl and Vancomycin. Despite the treatment, the"

   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.

   Pt continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube but
   abdominal exam is benign, no signs of blood in stool or other concerns
   for worsening colitis.  Family brought in probiotics.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.
   - probiotics via PEG.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG tube, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has recently been diagnosed with pneumonia and her stool specimens are positive for c-diff colitis. Her CT scan shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient has been intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to pneumonia, and there is a concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She will continue to receive Vancomycin and Meropenem to cover for possible infections. The goal is to make her net negative 1L for optimization of respiratory status. VAP precautions will be followed, and a follow-up chest X-ray will be done.

2. Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, most likely due to cefepime, as she has a known penicillin allergy. Benadryl will be given as needed for symptoms, and the patient will be taken off cefepime. The rash is expected to last for a few days.

3. Hypotension: The patient has borderline hypotension (SBPs 86-90s) after diuretic therapy with lasix. She will receive boluses for SBP <85. This may indicate a possible CHF"

   Assessment and Plan
   This is a 82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, a
   fib, CHF, c diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory
   failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Stool
   specimens positive for C diff colitis, and CT a/p consistent with
   diverticulitis/colitis.
   .
    # Respiratory failure:  Given her increased leukocytosis, increased
   secretions and recent intubation, possible pneumonia we are covering
   for  VAP. Patient did well on PS, but then required AC after tiring
   out..  Wanted to make her net negative before extubation, but patient
   becomes borderline hypotensive with lasix.  Patient
s CXR this morning
   again shows right lung collapse which has now become a chronic problem
   whenever pressure is decreased.  Patient is not likely to come off vent
   soon and should be evaluated for a trach early next week.
   -Continue Vanco, Meropenem (day [**4-15**])
   -Vanco trough tomorrow AM
   - PS  today as tolerated but consider early trach soon. [**Month (only) 8**] talk to IP
   on Monday.
   - VAP precautions
   - daily
   -Goal is  net negative 1L for optimization of respiratory status but no
   Lasix today [**2-8**] borderline hypotension (can use decreased dose if
   necessary-20IV)
   .
   # Rash: Appearance consistenent with drug rash,  most likely cefepime
   as patient has known penicillin allergy.  Unchanged since yesterday
   -d/c
d cefepime two days ago, expect rash to last a few days.
   .
   # Hypotension: Patient with boderline hypotension (SBPs 86-90s) after
   lasix diursesis, stable, not tachycardic.
   -bolus for SBP<85
   .
   # C Diff colitis:  On Flagyl/Vanc for cdiff (day 12, day one [**12-22**]).
   Pt continues to have loose stool through Flexiseal rectal tube but
   abdominal exam is benign, no signs of blood in stool or other concerns
   for worsening colitis.  Family brought in probiotics.
    -     PO Flagyl/vanc for minimum 2 week course, but likely will
   require longer course.
   - probiotics via PEG.
   .
   #Coagulopathy: PTT was too high with SQ heparin, normalized with 1 day
   off.
   -restart SQ heparin at lower dose (5000 [**Hospital1 **]) and re-check PTT in PM
   .
   # Hyponatremia:  Patient previously with hypernatremia, now
   hyponatremia x 2 days, likely due to too much free water.  Urine lytes
   unrevealing.
   -free water fluid restriction
   -check sodium PM
   .
   # CHF/Hemodynamics: Given recent hypotension, holding lisinopril,
   carvedilol, lasix. Patient has been net positive for [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will
   monitor.
   -Goal net even to -1L today.
   .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  INR at goal -2.3
   -                continue digoxin
   -                check dig level
   -                D/C coumadin for possible trach early in the week

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 83 yo F w/ dementia, prior CVA with residual
   aphasia and R hemiparesis, chf, a-fib presents with recurrent c diff,
   demand ischemia, unresponsiveness with intubation for airway control
   s/p failed extubation for mucus plugging/atelectasis.
        Increased WOB overnight on PS --> back to ACV.  Diuresed gently
   with good urine outpt. Free water held [**2-8**] development of hyponatremia.
   Exam notable for Tm AF BP 87/35 min HR 90's RR 12 on ACV
   400/12/5/40-->7.42/46/115.
   Thin elderly F, awake, unable to follow commands, coarse BS, [**Last Name (un) **],
   benign abd, + dep edema, R weakness (baseline)
   Labs notable for WBC 17.1 (19) K, HCT 26.6 (28.1) , na 130 (stable), K+
   3.8 , Cr 0.2,  lactate 3.1, INR 2.3
   CXR with ET and R IJ in position, rotated, RLL collapse
   Primary issues include:
     * Resp failure
   mucus plugging/atelectasis, secretions (no endobronchial lesion by
   bronch)
     * pna
     * volume overload
     * c diff colitis (recurrent)
     * drug rash
presumed from cefepime, improving
     * leukocytosis--improving slowly
     * hyponatremia
     * CVA
r hemeparesis, aphasia
     * dementia
   Agree with plan to continue current vent support while optimizing from
   resp status standpoint.  Has had intermittent mucus plugging and
   atelectasis and appears unlikely to wean from vent. Prior CVA and poor
   cough likely contributing to this and known R hemid paralysis. Family
   mtg yesterday and family is agreeable to trach.  Will consult IP
   service.  Continue chest pt, pulm toilet, sx and nebs.  Will complete
   (day [**4-15**]) course antibx (vanco/[**Last Name (un) **]) for presumed pna. Drug rash slowly
   improving since switching from cefepime. Continue PO vanco/IV flagyl
   for c-diff
will treat X 2 wks after additional antibx completed. Would
   hold coumadin for  trach and continue sq hep ([**Hospital1 **] dosing) for dvt
   prophy.  Continue digoxin for a-fib--would recheck level.
   Hyponatremia
suspect [**2-8**]  aggressive free water bolus in setting of
   hypernatremia though lung process may contribnute.  Appears total body
   vol up but intravascularly dry.  Free water restrict and monitor.  Has
   RIJ for central access
Will consult for picc line placement.  Remainder
   of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, which may be secondary to pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She has shown increased leukocytosis and recent intubation, indicating the need for coverage. The patient's right lung collapse on the chest X-ray suggests a chronic problem that may require tracheostomy placement.

2. Rash: The patient has developed a drug rash, most likely due to cefepime, considering her known penicillin allergy. The rash has been present for a few days and is expected to resolve soon.

3. Hypotension: The patient has borderline hypotension after diuresis, but she remains stable without tachycardia. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid management are necessary.

4. C-diff colitis: The patient is being treated with Flagyl and Vancomycin for c-diff colitis. Despite receiving treatment, the patient continues to have loose stools through a rectal tube. Probiotics have been provided via PEG, and a prolonged course of PO Flagyl/Vanc is planned.

5. Coagulopathy: The patient had a prolonged PTT with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has recently been diagnosed with pneumonia and has positive stool specimens for c-diff colitis. Her CT scan shows signs of diverticulitis/colitis. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. She has an increased leukocytosis and increased secretions, which raises concern for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's CXR shows right lung collapse, indicating a chronic problem with decreased pressure. She is not likely to be extubated soon and should be evaluated for a tracheostomy early next week.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is currently compromised, and she requires mechanical ventilation. She has an increased leukocytosis and increased secretions, which suggests the possibility of pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate antibiotic coverage are essential to prevent further complications.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's recent diagnosis of pneumonia and her prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Daily chest X-rays, respiratory secretions cultures, and adherence to VAP precautions are crucial for early detection and management.
3. C. Difficile Infection (CDI): The patient has been diagnosed with c-diff colitis"

   MICU ATTENDING ADDENDUM
   I saw and examined the patient, and was physically present with the ICU
   team for the key portions of the services provided. I agree with the
   note above, including the assessment and plan. I would emphasize and
   add the following points: 83 yo F w/ dementia, prior CVA with residual
   aphasia and R hemiparesis, chf, a-fib presents with recurrent c diff
   colitis, demand ischemia, unresponsiveness with intubation for airway
   control now s/p failed extubation for mucus plugging/atelectasis.
     Transient hypotension to 80's sys last night--> responded to IVF
   bolus.
   Exam notable for Tm AF BP 81-137/32-63 min HR 88-114 RR 12 on ACV
   400/12/5/40-->7.43/45/121.
   Thin elderly F, awake, but unable to follow commands, coarse BS, [**Last Name (un) **],
   benign abd, + dep edema, R weakness (baseline), trunkal and ext rash
   more confluent, slightly less erythematous
   Labs notable for WBC 14 (17.1<-19),  HCT 27.3 , na 133 (130),  K+ 3.8 ,
   Cr 0.2,  lactate 2.0  INR 2.0
   CXR with ET and R IJ in position, rotated, increased atelectasis R base
   and L, increased opacity both lungs, small lung volumes, R hemid
   elevation (chronic)
   Primary issues include:
     * Resp failure
   mucus plugging/atelectasis, secretions (no endobronchial lesion by
   bronch)
     * pna
     * volume overload
     * c diff colitis (recurrent)
     * drug rash
presumed from cefepime, improving slowly
     * leukocytosis--improving slowly
     * hyponatremia
     * CVA
r hemeparesis, aphasia
     * dementia
   Agree with plan to continue current vent support while attempting to
   optimize from resp status standpoint.  Pt continues to have
   intermittent mucus plugging and atelectasis on imaging and during wean
   attemtps and appears unlikely to wean from vent. Prior CVA and poor
   cough, known R hemid paralysis all likely contributing to this. Family
   is agreeable to trach.  Will consult IP service.  Continue chest pt,
   pulm toilet, sx and nebs given worsening atelectasis on cxr this am.
   Pt is tolerating well with no change in resp status or O2 sats.  Will
   consider bronch if no improvement or clincial change.  Will complete
   (day [**5-15**]) course [**First Name9 (NamePattern2) 3593**] [**Last Name (un) 350**]/vanco for presumed pna, following vanco
   levels for redosing. Drug rash slowly improving since switching from
   cefepime, though also concern that this may be [**2-8**] vanco.  Would check
   urine and serum eos. Continue PO vanco/IV flagyl for c-diff
 treat X 2
   wks after additional [**Month/Day (2) 3593**] completed. Holding coumadin for trach and
   continuing sq hep for dvt prophy and would start gtt hep given CHADs
   score once INR < 2.  Continue digoxin for a-fib--will recheck level.
   Hyponatremia
suspect [**2-8**]  aggressive free water bolus in setting of
   hypernatremia--improving with free water restriction.   Has RIJ for
   central access--unable to place bedside picc will need IR placement.
   Remainder of plan as outlined above.
   Patient is critically ill

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA, dementia, PEG, CHF, and c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. She has been intubated and is on mechanical ventilation. The patient's recent diagnosis of pneumonia and positive stool specimens for c-diff colitis are noted. Her CT a/p shows right lung collapse, consistent with diverticulitis/colitis. The patient's current issues include respiratory failure due to mucus plugging/atelectasis, presumed pneumonia, volume overload, recurrent c-diff colitis, drug rash, leukocytosis, hyponatremia, previous CVA with residual aphasia and right hemiparesis, and dementia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to mucus plugging and atelectasis. Continued efforts to optimize her respiratory status should be made, including chest physiotherapy, pulmonary toilet, and nebulizer treatments. Tracheostomy may be considered given her inability to wean off the ventilator.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has a recent diagnosis of pneumonia, and her current treatment includes meropenem and vancomycin. It is important to monitor her response to antibiotics and ensure appropriate coverage.
3. C-diff Colitis: The patient has recurrent c-diff colitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, CHF, c-diff who presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia and positive stool specimens for c-diff colitis. The patient's CT scan shows findings consistent with diverticulitis/colitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be due to pneumonia. The patient's CXR shows slightly improved right lung opacification. The plan is to perform a tracheostomy once the INR is below 1.5.

2. C Diff Colitis: The patient has been diagnosed with c-diff colitis, which is being treated with Flagyl/Vanc. The patient continues to have loose stools, but there are no signs of worsening colitis. 

3. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing hypotension, which may be related to increased stool output and free water restriction. The patient has been given a 1L NS bolus, and further monitoring and consideration of PRBCs as colloid if needed for hypotension later today.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to the use of heparin. The plan is to restart hepatic SQ and continue heparin at 5000 units. Vit K is being given PO to try to get"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff) colitis. She was admitted for respiratory failure and is currently in the ICU. The patient's family desires to continue with the current course of treatment and attempt to liberate her from the ventilator for two more days before considering a tracheostomy. The patient's albumin level is low at 1.8 g/dL, and her magnesium level is slightly low at 1.7 mg/dL. Her digoxin level is within therapeutic range. The patient's nutrition has been switched to Nutren 2.0 at a continuous rate of 25 mL/hr, but it will be turned off at midnight due to the planned insertion of an intra-arterial (IR) PICC line. The patient's heparin drip is scheduled to be discontinued on [**1-6**] at 0600.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's primary reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure, which can lead to hypoxia and hypercapnia if not properly managed.
2. Hypotension: The patient has a history of hypotension and is currently being monitored for any signs of shock.
3. Heart failure: The patient has a history of acute diastolic congest"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family discussion revealed desire to continue with current course and
   attempt to liberate from vent for 2 more days prior to additional
   consideration for tracheostomy
   - Albumin level returned at 1.8
   - PM lytes overall stable from prior with Mag slightly down to 1.7
   - PM HCT stable at 25.9
   - Digoxin level was 0.4 with no conern for patient being
   supratherapeutic
   - Per nutrition recs, tube feeds swtiched to Nutren 2.0 Full strength
   at continuous rate of 25 mL/hr; however, were ordered to be turned off
   at midnight in anticipation of IR PICC line placement on [**1-6**]
   - Heparin drip scheduled to be off on [**1-6**] at 0600
   - Patient with tachycardia and hypertension slowing escalating starting
   at [**2116**]. This all started when patient was being moved around in bed.
   - Fentanyl drip restarted with no apparent effect on HR and BP.
   - Was given furosemide 40 mg IV x 1 due to HTN concurrent low UOP.
   - Was restarted on midazolam drip. Shortly after re-initiation of
   midazolam, HR dropped below 100 and SBP settled into the 110s.

","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, fib, CHF, and C. diff colitis, admitted for respiratory failure. The patient's current condition includes being unresponsive, on mechanical ventilation, and has a diagnosis of pneumonia. The patient's recent lab results show elevated WBC, Hct, and platelet levels, along with abnormal kidney function tests. 

The potential medical complications that can arise based on the provided information include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's initial presentation was respiratory failure, which is being managed with mechanical ventilation. There is an ongoing discussion about the possibility of performing a tracheostomy.

2. C. diff colitis: The patient has positive stool specimens for C. diff colitis and is currently receiving treatment with Flagyl and Vancomycin. It is important to monitor for worsening symptoms or signs of toxic megacolon.

3. Hypotension: The patient has experienced hypotension, possibly related to stool output and free water restriction. Close monitoring and appropriate fluid resuscitation are necessary.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient has an elevated INR due to Coumadin therapy, which may be contributing to the bleeding risk. The heparin gtt has been restarted, and Vitamin K has been administered to lower the INR for possible tracheostomy.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has had fluctuations in sodium levels, currently within"

   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presents with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
    # Respiratory failure:  Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family
   wishes a few more days for vent manipulation prior to considering trach
   placement.
   - continue current vent settings, check ABG today.
   - continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
    -Continue Meropenem (day [**7-15**]) for PNA.
   - consider gentle diuresis pending hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability: Patient intermittently hypotensive due to
   fluid losses from stool, receives IVFs, then becomes hypertensive and
   tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability [**2-8**] CVA, but
   hypertension likely associated with agitation from sedation wean +
   volume overload. CXR shows less volume overload in response to IV lasix
   administered yesterday. However LOS still +18 L.  HTN resolved with
   increased sedation.
   - continue BP monitoring
   - titrate sedation as needed
   - goal I/O -500 ccs, re-check in PM, consider lasix gtt for some gentle
   diuresis.
   - holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   responsive to fluid boluses.
   - Receiving PICC today for access.

   Stable.
   -continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:  continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with
   no signs of worsening colitis.
   - cont PO Flagyl and PO vanc for minimum 2 week course after d/c other
   abx. (day one [**12-22**])
   - probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Hyponatremia:  resolved with fluid restriction.
    .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  Hemodynamically stable
   and rate controlled. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   Reversed INR with vit K x1 yesterday to get INR to 1.5 for trach/PEG
   procedures, which are currently on hold.
   -  continue digoxin
   -  holding coumadin (receving PICC), after goal should be [**2-9**].
   -  on heparin gtt, being held while patient receives PICC, then can be
   restarted for anticoagulation coverage while patient awaits trach.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The family wishes to continue with current ventilator settings for a few more days before considering tracheostomy placement. The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia. She is on multiple medications including meropenem, albuterol, ipratroprium, furosemide, digoxin, and insulin sliding scale.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or further deterioration in respiratory function.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive and hypertensive, indicating possible autonomic instability. This could lead to organ dysfunction and poor perfusion.
3. C. difficile infection/colitis: Although the patient's current symptoms are benign, there is a risk of worsening colitis and potential complications such as toxic megacolon or sepsis.
4. Drug rash: The patient developed a rash likely due to cefepime, which has been stopped. Monitoring for any progression or new rashes is essential.
5. Hyponatremia: The patient previously had hyponatremia but has been resolved with fluid restriction. Monitoring sodium levels and adjusting treatment accordingly is"

   24 Hour Events:
   - Family discussion revealed desire to continue with current course and
   attempt to liberate from vent for 2 more days prior to additional
   consideration for tracheostomy
   - Albumin level returned at 1.8
   - PM lytes overall stable from prior with Mag slightly down to 1.7
   - PM HCT stable at 25.9
   - Digoxin level was 0.4 with no conern for patient being
   supratherapeutic
   - Per nutrition recs, tube feeds swtiched to Nutren 2.0 Full strength
   at continuous rate of 25 mL/hr; however, were ordered to be turned off
   at midnight in anticipation of IR PICC line placement on [**1-6**]
   - Heparin drip scheduled to be off on [**1-6**] at 0600
   - Patient with tachycardia and hypertension slowing escalating starting
   at [**2116**]. This all started when patient was being moved around in bed.
   - Fentanyl drip restarted with no apparent effect on HR and BP.
   - Was given furosemide 40 mg IV x 1 due to HTN concurrent low UOP.
   - Was restarted on midazolam drip. Shortly after re-initiation of
   midazolam, HR dropped below 100 and SBP settled into the 110s.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient's family wishes to continue current ventilator settings for a few more days before considering tracheostomy placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and is currently on mechanical ventilation. There is a need to monitor ABG levels and continue current vent settings. The patient is also receiving albuterol and ipratroprium inhalers.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient is intermittently hypotensive due to fluid losses from stool and has been receiving IV fluids. This has resulted in episodes of hypertension and tachycardia. Autonomic instability due to [**2-8**] cerebrovascular accident (CVA) may be a contributing factor. The patient's blood pressure has resolved with increased sedation and volume overload. A chest X-ray shows less volume overload in response to IV lasix administered yesterday. The patient's I/O output should be monitored, and further diuresis may be considered.
3. Rash: The patient has developed a rash likely due to cefepime drug reaction. Cefepime has been stopped, and eucerin cream is being applied daily.

   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
    # Respiratory failure:  Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family
   wishes a few more days for vent manipulation prior to considering trach
   placement.  However, after >1.5 wks intubated this time around, Trach
   would be medically appropriate.

   - consider gentle diuresis pending hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability: Patient intermittently hypotensive due to
   fluid losses from stool, receives IVFs, then becomes hypertensive and
   tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability [**2-8**] CVA, but
   hypertension likely associated with agitation from sedation wean +
   volume overload. CXR shows less volume overload in response to IV lasix
   administered yesterday. However LOS still +15 L.  Hypotensive this am
   resolved spontaneously
   - continue BP monitoring
   - titrate sedation as needed
   - goal I/O -500 ccs, re-check in PM, consider restarting lasix gtt at
   2/hr for some gentle diuresis.
   - holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   responsive to fluid boluses.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, recently diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient's family wishes to manipulate the ventilator for a few more days before considering tracheostomy placement. However, after being intubated for more than 1.5 weeks this time, tracheostomy would be medically appropriate. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia. The family's wish to manipulate the ventilator may delay tracheostomy placement, increasing the risk of further respiratory complications.

2. Electrolyte & Fluid Disorder: The patient has an ongoing electrolyte imbalance, particularly hyponatremia which has resolved with fluid restriction. There is also a concern for fluid overload due to the recent administration of IV lasix and ongoing losses from stool. This could lead to further electrolyte disturbances and potential cardiac issues.

3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension and hypertension, likely due to fluid losses and autonomic instability related to her CVA. This instability may increase the risk of complications such as hypoperfusion or shock.

4. Impaired Skin Integrity: The patient has impaired skin integrity, which increases the risk of pressure ulcers and infections.

5. C. difficile Infection: Although the patient's"

   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presents with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
    # Respiratory failure:  Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family
   wishes a few more days for vent manipulation prior to considering trach
   placement.
   - continue current vent settings, check ABG today.
   - continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
    -Continue Meropenem (day [**7-15**]) for PNA.
   - consider gentle diuresis pending hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability: Patient intermittently hypotensive due to
   fluid losses from stool, receives IVFs, then becomes hypertensive and
   tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability [**2-8**] CVA, but
   hypertension likely associated with agitation from sedation wean +
   volume overload. CXR shows less volume overload in response to IV lasix
   administered yesterday. However LOS still +18 L.  HTN resolved with
   increased sedation.
   - continue BP monitoring
   - titrate sedation as needed
   - goal I/O -500 ccs, re-check in PM, consider lasix gtt for some gentle
   diuresis.
   - holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   responsive to fluid boluses.
   - Receiving PICC today for access.
   . # Rash: Likely cefepime drug rash. Cefepime stopped on [**1-1**]. Rash
   Stable.
   -continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:  continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with
   no signs of worsening colitis.
   - cont PO Flagyl and PO vanc for minimum 2 week course after d/c other
   abx. (day one [**12-22**])
   - probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Hyponatremia:  resolved with fluid restriction.
    .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  Hemodynamically stable
   and rate controlled. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   Reversed INR with vit K x1 yesterday to get INR to 1.5 for trach/PEG
   procedures, which are currently on hold.
   -  continue digoxin
   -  holding coumadin (receving PICC), after goal should be [**2-9**].
   -  on heparin gtt, being held while patient receives PICC, then can be
   restarted for anticoagulation coverage while patient awaits trach.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of stroke/dementia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and Clostridium difficile infection. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient's family wishes to manipulate the ventilator before considering tracheostomy placement. However, after being intubated for over a week, tracheostomy may be medically appropriate.

The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia. She has been on antibiotics (meropenem and vancomycin) for 8 days. There are concerns about electrolyte and fluid disorders, impaired skin integrity, and potential complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), hypertension, and autonomic instability.

Plan:
1. Respiratory failure: Trial of CPAP today, continue albuterol and ipratropium inhalers. Consider tracheostomy placement.
2. Hemodynamic instability: Monitor blood pressure, adjust sedation as needed, goal I/O -500 ccs, re-check in PM, consider lasix gtt for gentle diuresis.
3. Rash: Continue eucerin cream daily.
4. C. Diff colitis: Continue PO Flagyl and PO vanc for minimum 2-week course after discontinuing other antibiotics. Provide probiotics via PEG.

   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presents with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
    # Respiratory failure:  Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family
   wishes a few more days for vent manipulation prior to considering trach
   placement.
   - continue current vent settings, check ABG today.
   - continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
    -Continue Meropenem (day [**7-15**]) for PNA.
   - consider gentle diuresis pending hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability: Patient intermittently hypotensive due to
   fluid losses from stool, receives IVFs, then becomes hypertensive and
   tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability [**2-8**] CVA, but
   hypertension likely associated with agitation from sedation wean +
   volume overload. CXR shows less volume overload in response to IV lasix
   administered yesterday. However LOS still +18 L.  HTN resolved with
   increased sedation.
   - continue BP monitoring
   - titrate sedation as needed
   - goal I/O -500 ccs, re-check in PM, consider lasix gtt for some gentle
   diuresis.
   - holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   responsive to fluid boluses.
   - Receiving PICC today for access.
   . # Rash: Likely cefepime drug rash. Cefepime stopped on [**1-1**]. Rash
   Stable.
   -continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:  continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with
   no signs of worsening colitis.
   - cont PO Flagyl and PO vanc for minimum 2 week course after d/c other
   abx. (day one [**12-22**])
   - probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Hyponatremia:  resolved with fluid restriction.
    .
   # Afib - On digoxin. Coumadin restarted [**12-31**].  Hemodynamically stable
   and rate controlled. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   Reversed INR with vit K x1 yesterday to get INR to 1.5 for trach/PEG
   procedures, which are currently on hold.
   -  continue digoxin
   -  holding coumadin (receving PICC), after goal should be [**2-9**].
   -  on heparin gtt, being held while patient receives PICC, then can be
   restarted for anticoagulation coverage while patient awaits trach.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. The patient presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.

The patient's medical complications include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe (RLL) collapse and pneumonia (PNA). The family wishes to continue ventilator manipulation for a few more days before considering tracheostomy placement.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient experiences intermittent hypotension due to fluid losses from stool and becomes hypertensive and tachycardic. This is likely due to autonomic instability caused by the CVA, but hypertension may also be associated with agitation from sedation wean and volume overload. The CXR shows less volume overload in response to intravenous (IV) lasix administered yesterday. However, the patient still has a positive fluid balance of +18 liters. Hypotension resolved with increased sedation.

3. Rash: The patient has a drug rash likely caused by cefepime. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**], and the rash is stable. Eucerin cream is applied daily.

4. Clostridium difficile infection/"

The patient has been intubated for over a week and tracheostomy would be medically appropriate at this point.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure is likely due to her recent diagnosis of pneumonia. Continuing mechanical ventilation is necessary for now, but tracheostomy placement may be required soon.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient has been intermittently hypotensive, possibly due to fluid losses from stool and autonomic instability related to her medical history. Close monitoring of blood pressure, titration of sedation, and gentle diuresis may help stabilize her hemodynamics.
3. C Difficile Infection/Colitis: The patient has ongoing loose stools, but her abdomen is benign without signs of worsening colitis. She should continue with oral Flagyl and PO vanc for a minimum two-week course after discontinuing other antibiotics. Probiotics via PEG should also be provided by the family.
4. Rash: The patient has a drug rash likely caused by cefepime, which has been stopped. Applying eucerin cream daily may help"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family wishes a few more days for
   vent manipulation prior to considering trach placement.  Patient has
   been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator. CPAP trial this AM revealed that patient
   could not tolerate due to low minute ventilation.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
    -Completed 8 day course of Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**]
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip pending
   hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability:
   Patient intermittently hypotensive, receives IVFs, then becomes
   hypertensive and tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability
   secondary to CVA, but hypertension also potentially associated with
   agitation from sedation wean in setting of volume overload. Patient was
   1.8 L negative for fluid balance yesterday, howere still difusely
   edematous with fluid balance of  positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Titrate sedation as needed
   - Goal I/O should be even to  -500 mL, re-check in PM, consider
   restarting lasix gtt at 1/hr for some gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   Likely cefepime drug rash. Cefepime stopped on [**1-1**]. Rash resolving
   with improving erythema and some residual desquamation.
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO will start
   today ([**2195-1-8**])
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 80s
 100s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in
   anticipation of procedures, peding family decision

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: Needs continued intensive care status
","The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely secondary to recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. 

The patient's medical history includes chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia. The family wishes to continue with ventilator manipulation for a few more days before considering tracheostomy placement. 

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, and a rash likely due to cefepime drug reaction. The rash is resolving with improving erythema and some residual desquamation. 

The patient also has ongoing Clostridium difficile colitis, which will be treated with a two-week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO. 

The patient is currently on digoxin for atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled and hemodynamically stable. The CHADS2 score is greater than 4, indicating the need for anticoagulation. Warfarin is currently on hold, and the patient is receiving heparin drip in anticipation of procedures, pending family decision. 

In terms of ICU care, the patient is receiving nutrition through Nutren 2.0 (Full) at 25 mL/hour. Glycemic control is being maintained. The patient has a PICC line in place and is receiving prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (boots and systemic anticoagulation with heparin drip), stress ulcer prevention (lansoprazole), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions. 

The patient's code status is full code, and she requires continued intensive care status."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient in the ICU is critically ill and on mechanical ventilation. The medical team is attempting to wean the patient off the ventilator but has not had significant progress. The patient has a history of pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm paralysis, and recurrent right upper lobe atelectasis. There is also new development of left lower lobe density, which may indicate atelectasis. The patient's nutritional status is poor, with low albumin levels. The patient's blood pressure has improved, but there is a desire for a net negative fluid balance. The patient has right hemiparesis and aphasia, likely due to a stroke. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole. The patient's atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled, and anticoagulation is being used. The rash, which is improving, was likely caused by an allergic reaction to antibiotics. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is critically ill and has several medical complications. 

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, including recent pneumonia, right hemidiaphragm paralysis, and recurrent right upper lobe atelectasis. There has been no significant progress in weaning from mechanical ventilation, and a tracheotomy tube may be considered if acceptable to the patient.

2. Left Lower Lobe (LLL) Density: The patient has developed new interval development of LLL density, which is suspected to be atelectasis. However, there is no evidence of active lung infection at this time.

3. Nutritional Support: The patient's nutritional support should continue with tube feeding (TF). The patient's albumin levels remain poor.

4. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension has improved.

5. Fluids: The patient desires a net negative fluid balance.

6. Cerebrovascular Accident (CVA): The patient has right hemiparesis and aphasia due to a CVA.

7. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff): The patient is being treated for C. Diff with oral vancomycin and intravenous metronidazole for two weeks after completing additional antibiotics.

8. Atrial Fibrillation (A-FIB): The patient's A-FIB is rate-controlled, and anticoagulation is required.

9. ICU Care: The patient's ICU care includes nutrition"

   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip pending
   hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability:
   Patient had an episode of hypotension to the 80
s which resolved with
   stimulation yesterday. Likely some autonomic instability secondary to
   CVA, but hypertension also potentially associated with agitation from
   sedation wean in setting of volume overload.  Now off the fentanyl
   drip.   Patient was 500 cc negative for fluid balance yesterday, howere
   still difusely edematous with fluid balance of  positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be even to -500 mL, continue lasix gtt at 1/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an ertyhematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 2
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 80s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. The family is willing to allow tracheostomy placement.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia, and completed an 8-day course of Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**]. Due to her inability to liberate from the ventilator, tracheostomy placement is planned.
2. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension to the 80s which resolved with stimulation. This could be due to autonomic instability secondary to CVA or potential hypertension associated with agitation during sedation wean in the setting of volume overload.
3. Rash: The patient has an erythematous rash with residual desquamation, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   -  Will have a trach placed today.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip pending
   hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability:
   Patient had an episode of hypotension to the 80
s which resolved
   spontanesously yesterday. Likely some autonomic instability secondary
   to CVA, but hypertension also potentially associated with agitation
   from sedation wean in setting of volume overload.  Now off the fentanyl
   drip.   Patient was 500 cc negative for fluid balance yesterday, howere
   still difusely edematous with fluid balance of  positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 mL to 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an ertyhematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 2
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 80s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 Patient with a Hct of 25.6 this am (stable from 25.3
   yesterday).  Her Hct was in the low 30
s on admission and has trended
   downward over her stay.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely
   secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.

","Summary:
An 82-year-old female patient with a history of CVA/dementia, PEG, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis presents with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure. The patient has been intubated for almost two weeks and has been on a course of antibiotics for pneumonia. The family has agreed to tracheostomy placement. The patient is experiencing episodes of hypotension, likely due to autonomic instability from a stroke or volume overload. There is also a concern for a drug rash secondary to cefepime. The patient is being treated for C. difficile colitis with vancomycin and metronidazole. She is on digoxin for atrial fibrillation and requires anticoagulation due to a high CHADS2 score. The patient's hemoglobin levels have been trending downward, possibly due to acute illness, and she is being monitored closely.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's current condition of unresponsiveness and respiratory failure may continue if the tracheostomy placement is not successful or if there are complications during the weaning process from the ventilator.
2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient's episodes of hypotension could indicate ongoing hemodynamic instability, which could lead to further complications such as shock or organ dysfunction.
3. Drug rash: The patient's erythematous rash with desquamation may worsen if it is indeed secondary to c"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA. Family wishes a few more days for
   vent manipulation prior to considering trach placement.  Patient has
   been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator. CPAP trial this AM revealed that patient
   could not tolerate due to low minute ventilation.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
    -Completed 8 day course of Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**]
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip pending
   hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability:
   Patient intermittently hypotensive, receives IVFs, then becomes
   hypertensive and tachycardic. Likely some autonomic instability
   secondary to CVA, but hypertension also potentially associated with
   agitation from sedation wean in setting of volume overload. Patient was
   1.8 L negative for fluid balance yesterday, howere still difusely
   edematous with fluid balance of  positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Titrate sedation as needed
   - Goal I/O should be even to  -500 mL, re-check in PM, consider
   restarting lasix gtt at 1/hr for some gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   Likely cefepime drug rash. Cefepime stopped on [**1-1**]. Rash resolving
   with improving erythema and some residual desquamation.
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Continues to have loose stools, but benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO will start
   today ([**2195-1-8**])
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 80s
 100s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in
   anticipation of procedures, peding family decision

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   await trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.  Due
   to scheduling difficult the trach was unable to be placed yesterday and
   will have to be placed next Tuesday.
   -  Trach placement early next week
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of 1
   L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 2/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an ertyhematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 3
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 Patient with a stable Hct of 28.0 this am.  Her Hct was in
   the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.

   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   -  Will have a trach placed today.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip pending
   hemodynamic stability (see below)
   - VAP precautions
   # Hemodynamic instability:
   Patient had an episode of hypotension to the 80
s which resolved
   spontanesously yesterday. Likely some autonomic instability secondary
   to CVA, but hypertension also potentially associated with agitation
   from sedation wean in setting of volume overload.  Now off the fentanyl
   drip.   Patient was 500 cc negative for fluid balance yesterday, howere
   still difusely edematous with fluid balance of  positive 15 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 mL to 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an ertyhematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 2
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 80s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 Patient with a Hct of 25.6 this am (stable from 25.3
   yesterday).  Her Hct was in the low 30
s on admission and has trended
   downward over her stay.  No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely
   secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. The patient presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia. She has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks, and there is a need for a tracheostomy placement due to the chronic need for mechanical ventilation.

2. Hemodynamic instability: The patient had an episode of hypotension which resolved spontaneously. There is also potential hypertension associated with agitation from sedation wean in the setting of volume overload. Close monitoring of blood pressure is required.

3. Rash: The patient continues to have an erythematous rash with residual desquamation, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. It is important to continue applying eucerin cream daily.

4. C Difficile colitis: Although the stools are not as loose now, the patient is still at risk for worsening colitis. She is on a two-week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on [**2195-1-8**], now day 2, and probiotics via PEG provided by the family.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, likely due to recent pneumonia. She has been intubated for close to two weeks and requires tracheostomy placement due to her inability to liberate from the ventilator. The patient's family has agreed to allow tracheostomy placement, which will be scheduled for next Tuesday.

The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, volume status/BP issues, a rash secondary to cefepime drug reaction, Clostridium difficile colitis, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. She is receiving various treatments such as albuterol and ipratroprium inhalers, furosemide drip for diuresis, VAP precautions, holding lisinopril and carvedilol due to hypotension, eucerin cream for the rash, vancomycin and metronidazole for C. difficile colitis, digoxin for AF, and heparin drip for anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to liberate from the ventilator indicates a potential complication of respiratory failure.
2. Volume Status/BP: The patient is still edematous and has a positive fluid balance for the"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- persistent.  Attributed primarily to  Awaiting
   ATALECTASIS -- persistent LLL.  Recurrent problem, initially with right
   lung.  [**Month (only) 8**] benefit from bronchoscopy to aspirate LLL secretions.
   RASH -- attributed to antibiotics (cefopime).  Resolving.
   C. Diff -- continue antimicrobials (PO Vanco, Flagyl)
   A-FIB -- rate controlled.  Digoxin alone.  Continue anticoagulation.
   HYPOTENSION -- resolved.  Monitor BP, maintain MAP
   FLUIDS -- desire net negative fluid balance.  Monitor I/O.
   NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT -- TF via PEG.
   h/o CVA -- stable.
   Primary issues include:
   Resp failure
   mucus plugging/atelectasis, secretions (no endobronchial lesion by
   bronch)
   pna
   volume overload
   c diff colitis (recurrent)
   drug rash

   to continue current vent support.  Continue chest pt, pulm toilet, sx
   and nebs.  Is now s/p course antibx for pna. Continue gentle diuresis
   with lasix gtt (on hold for now) at low dose pending I/O's evaluation,
   with goal 500 to 1 L neg fluid balance. Afib on dig with well
   controlled rates. ? component of autonomic insuff from prior cva
   contributing to intermittent HOTN/htn also likely related to fluid
   shifts with diuresis.   Drug rash continues to resolve. Continue PO
   vanco/IV flagyl for c-diff -->to complete on [**1-21**]. Given CHADs score is
   on hep gtt-->on hold for trach. Anemia remains stable--transfusion
   threshold of hct 21, no evidence of active ischemia. TFs (on hold for

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   await trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of 1
   L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 14 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-2/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an ertyhematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 4
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT down to 23 today (was 28 yesterday).  Her Hct was in the
   low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for almost two weeks and is scheduled to undergo tracheostomy placement on Tuesday. Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a temperature of 36.7°C, heart rate in the 90s, blood pressure ranging from 133/52 to 140/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient has diffuse pitting edema and an erythematous rash with desquamation. Her laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin and platelet count, normal kidney function, and elevated lactate levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to liberate from the ventilator may indicate ongoing respiratory failure, which could be exacerbated by tracheostomy placement. Close monitoring of respiratory parameters is necessary during and after the procedure.
2. Volume status/BP: The patient's fluid balance is positive 14 liters for the length of stay, indicating fluid overload. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure and"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory function remains compromised, as indicated by her prolonged intubation and need for tracheostomy placement. There is a risk of further respiratory failure if the tracheostomy placement does not go as planned or if the patient develops any complications post-procedure.

2. Volume Status/BP: The patient has had better controlled blood pressures recently but still exhibits diffuse edema and a positive fluid balance for the length of stay. There is a risk of fluid overload and associated complications such as heart failure exacerbation or pulmonary edema.

3. Rash: The patient has an erythematous rash with desquamation, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. This rash may indicate an allergic reaction or an adverse drug event, which can lead to further skin complications or systemic reactions.

4. C. Difficile Colitis: Although the patient's stools are not as loose now, she has a history of C. difficile infection/colitis. There is a risk of recurrence or worsening of"

   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of 1
   L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 14 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 4
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT down to 23 today (was 28 yesterday).  Her Hct was in the
   low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, recently diagnosed with pneumonia. The patient has been intubated for almost two weeks and will be undergoing tracheostomy placement on Tuesday. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but she has diffuse pitting edema and an erythematous rash with desquamation, likely secondary to cefepime drug rash. She also has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia, for which she completed an 8-day course of meropenem and vancomycin. Her anemia has worsened, with a HCT of 23 today, and her blood pressures have been better controlled. She is currently on heparin drip due to an elevated CHADS2 score and requires anticoagulation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. Tracheostomy placement is scheduled to be done on Tuesday.
2. Volume Status/BP: The patient has positive fluid balance for the length of stay and continues to be edematous. Gentle diuresis with furosemide is ongoing to achieve a goal of 1 L negative.

","The patient is a critically ill individual who remains intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's medical history includes allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and cefepime with a rash. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), heart rate of 95 bpm, blood pressure of 125/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is negative for fatigue, fever, weight loss, chest pain, palpitations, edema, tachycardia, and orthopnea.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, an endotracheal tube, normal pupils, and no conjunctival pallor or scleral icterus. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal point of maximal impulse (PMI), regular heart rhythm with atrial fibrillation (AF), and no murmurs. The respiratory examination is notable for symmetric chest expansion, resonant percussion notes, and clear breath sounds bilaterally. The abdominal examination shows soft and non-tender bowel sounds with no distention or tenderness. Extremities are warm and well-perfused without cyanosis or clubbing. Neurologic examination demonstrates the patient is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds to verbal"

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure attributed to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient remains intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient has a history of penicillins allergy, unknown allergies to erythromycin base and cefepime, and a rash associated with cefepime. The patient is currently receiving heparin sodium, furosemide (Lasix), and other ICU medications.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.7°C (98.1°F), a heart rate of 95 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 125/51 mmHg to 144/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient has atrial fibrillation.

The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and an overweight/obese body type. The patient's eyes are PERRL (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light), with no conjunctival edema. The patient's cardiovascular examination shows normal heart rhythm, no murmurs, and no signs of heart failure. The respiratory examination demonstrates clear lung sounds bilaterally, with no crackles or wheezes.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count ranging from 6.8 to 10.5 K/uL, hemoglobin levels between 23.5% and 27.1 g/dL, platelet count between 355 and 447 K/uL, creatinine levels between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/dL, blood glucose levels between 90 and 163 mg/dL, and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia. Other lab values indicate elevated liver enzymes, lactate levels, LDH, and troponin T, as well as low albumin and fibrinogen levels.

The patient's assessment and plan include ongoing supportive care for respiratory failure, monitoring for anemia, persistent left lower lobe atelectasis, resolving rash attributed to antibiotics, Clostridium difficile infection, atrial fibrillation rate control, hypotension, fluid balance, nutritional support, and stable history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient is expected to undergo tracheostomy (trach) in the near future and will continue anticoagulation with heparin."

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   await trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of 1
   L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 14 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 4
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT down to 23 today (was 28 yesterday).  Her Hct was in the
   low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning

The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. Her family is now willing to allow tracheostomy placement as previously planned on Tuesday. The patient's BPs have been better controlled, but she remains edematous with a positive fluid balance for her LOS. She continues to have an erythematous rash, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash, which is improving. Her stools are not as loose now, indicating improvement in C. difficile colitis. The patient's CHADS2 score is >4, requiring anticoagulation. Her HCT has stabilized at 25.2 today (was 23.6 yesterday), and she is being actively diuresed. The patient will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21. Trach placement is scheduled on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**]. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if tracheostomy placement is not successful or if there are complications during the procedure.
2. Volume Status/BP: The patient's positive fluid balance and edema indicate ongoing"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 14 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 4
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 25.2 today (was 23.6 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure due to recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. The plan is to place a tracheostomy on Tuesday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to be weaned off the ventilator increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and prolonged mechanical ventilation.
2. Volume status/BP: The patient's positive fluid balance and edema indicate a risk of fluid overload and possible congestive heart failure exacerbation.
3. Rash: The patient has an erythematous rash likely secondary to cefepime drug rash. Continued monitoring is necessary to ensure no progression or new symptoms.
4. Clostridium difficile colitis: Although the patient's stools are not as loose, ongoing monitoring is required to prevent recurrence or worsening of symptoms.
5. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is on digoxin for rate control, and anticoagulation is necessary due to a CHADS2 score > 4. Close monitoring of heart rate and coagulation status is essential.
6. Anemia: The patient's HCT has been stable but low. Regular monitoring and consideration of"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Her family is now willing to
   allow trach placement as the patient has been intubated for close to
   two weeks without significant ability to liberate from ventilator.
   Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday, [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1 L negative
   yesterday howevre still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 14 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr for
   gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash with residual
   desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. Cefepime was
   stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 4
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT down to 23 today (was 28 yesterday).  Her Hct was in the
   low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.  No
   clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA)/dementia, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia diagnosis. The patient has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to wean off the ventilator. Tracheostomy placement is scheduled on Tuesday. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia. Despite completing an 8-day course of meropenem and vancomycin, she remains intubated. There is a risk of further respiratory deterioration and potential need for prolonged mechanical ventilation or tracheostomy.
2. Volume Status/BP: The patient's blood pressures have been better controlled recently, but she still has fluid overload with a positive fluid balance of 14 liters for her length of stay. There is a risk of recurrent hypotension and fluid-related complications such as pulmonary edema.
3. Rash: The patient has an erythematous rash with residual desquamation, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. This could indicate an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity to the medication.
4. C Diff Colitis: Although the patient's stools are not as loose now, she still requires treatment for C"

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old male with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), dementia, atrial fibrillation, and Clostridium difficile infection. He has persistent respiratory failure due to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure. He is intubated and awaiting tracheostomy. The patient also has anemia, a rash attributed to antibiotics, and Clostridium difficile infection. His atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with digoxin, and he continues to receive anticoagulation therapy with heparin in preparation for tracheostomy. The patient receives nutritional support through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and requires careful glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale. He has multiple lines, including a PICC line, and receives prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis, stress ulcers, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The patient's code status is full code, and his current disposition is in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening pneumonia or development of new infections due to intubation and prolonged ICU stay.
2. Atelectasis: The patient has bronchial drainage for right lower lobe atelectasis. There is a risk of recurrent or worsening atelectasis due to inadequate clearance or new lung pathology.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   yesterday to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.  Her
   family is now willing to allow trach placement as the patient has been
   intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator.  Trach is scheduled to be placed today.
   -  Trach placement today
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1.3 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 12.5 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1- 1.5 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash which is improving
   now with residual desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug
   rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 5
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   - Heparin gtt currently held for trach placement will restarted
   following placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 25.2 today (was 23.6 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, and has been intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to liberate from the ventilator. The patient has chronic RLL collapse and pneumonia, completed a course of antibiotics, and underwent bronchoscopy. Her family is willing to allow tracheostomy placement today. The patient has an erythematous rash that is improving, likely secondary to a cefepime drug rash. She also has ongoing C. difficile colitis, which is being treated with vancomycin and metronidazole. The patient is on digoxin for AFib and is hemodynamically stable. Her HCT is stable at 25.2 today, but has trended downward over her stay. She has been diuresed to a goal of -1.5 L negative fluid balance, and her BPs have been better controlled. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory status remains unstable, as evidenced by the need for prolonged intubation. Tracheostomy placement is planned, which may improve her ventilation and weaning from the ventilator.
2. Volume status/BP: Despite being diuresed, the patient still has diffuse edema and a positive fluid balance for her LOS. It is crucial to"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   yesterday to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.  Her
   family is now willing to allow trach placement as the patient has been
   intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator.  Trach is scheduled to be placed on Tuesday,
   [**2195-1-13**].
   -  Trach placement Tuesday [**2195-1-13**]
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1.3 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 12.5 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1- 1.5 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash which is improving
   now with residual desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug
   rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 5
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Warfarin currently on hold and patient receiving heparin drip in as
   she is going for trach placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 25.2 today (was 23.6 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 57-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure due to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure. He has been intubated for 21 days and is awaiting a tracheostomy. The patient has anemia, a rash attributed to cefepime, and Clostridium difficile infection. His atrial fibrillation is rate-controlled with digoxin, and he continues to receive anticoagulation with heparin. The patient requires nutritional support via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and has a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), which is currently stable with no evidence of new neurological events. The patient's vital signs are stable, and he is receiving supportive care, including diuresis for negative fluid balance. There is a discussion about potential benefits of packed red blood cells or albumin to maintain intravascular pressure while diuresing, especially considering profound hypo-albuminemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, atelectasis, and CHF. The ongoing need for intubation increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be monitored serially, and there is no obvious clinical bleeding. However, the patient may require blood transfusions to correct"

They have been intubated for 21 days and are awaiting a tracheostomy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, blood pressure ranging from 109/63 mmHg to 141/67 mmHg, heart rate between 85 and 115 bpm, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is on multiple medications, including furosemide, heparin, digoxin, and prevacid.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure is attributed to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure. Continuing supportive care and planning for a tracheostomy are necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient has anemia, but there is no obvious clinical bleeding. Monitoring hemoglobin concentration (Hct) serially is recommended.
3. Rash: The patient developed a rash attributed to antibiotics (cefepime). It is resolving.
4. Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) infection: The patient is being treated with antimicrobials for C. Diff, including oral vancomycin and metronidazole.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   yesterday to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.  Her
   family is now willing to allow trach placement as the patient has been
   intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator.  Trach is scheduled to be placed today.
   -  Trach placement today
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1.3 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 12.5 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1- 1.5 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash which is improving
   now with residual desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug
   rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 5
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   - Heparin gtt currently held for trach placement will restarted
   following placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 25.2 today (was 23.6 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia
   awaiting trach placement.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   yesterday to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.  Her
   family is now willing to allow trach placement as the patient has been
   intubated for close to two weeks without significant ability to
   liberate from ventilator.  Trach is scheduled to be placed today.
   -  Trach placement today
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - Continue ongoing gentle diuresis with furosemide drip for a goal of
   [**1-8**].5 L negative.
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 1.3 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 12.5 L for LOS.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 1- 1.5 L negative, continue lasix gtt at 1-5/hr
   for gentle diuresis.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to episodes of hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient cotinues to have an erythematous rash which is improving
   now with residual desquamation.  Likely secondary to a cefepime drug
   rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Stools are not as loose now and she has a benign abd with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 5
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 90s
 110s.
   CHADS2 score > 4, requiring anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   - Heparin gtt currently held for trach placement will restarted
   following placement.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 23.7 today (was 24.8 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia s/p
   trach placement yesterday.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   recently to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.
   Given that she was unalbe to be weaned from the ventilator for > 2
   weeks she had a trach placed yesterday.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - goal of 500 cc - 1 L negative as below to improve volume overload
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   - Will do a trial of PS to see if she can generate adequate tidal
   volume to be weaned off eventually to a trach mask.
   # Volume status/BP/Tachycardia:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 2 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 9.6 L for LOS.  With the 2 L of diuresis yesterday she has
   become tachycardic, likely from intrvascular volume depletion.
   - Hold diuresis currently and will give a 250 cc NS bolus for likely
   intravascular volume depletion.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 cc to 1 L negative, once her HR normalizes,
   can restart a very low dose of lasix gtt.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to previsou episodes of
   hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient
s rash is much improved.  Likely secondary to a cefepime
   drug rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Diarrhea is resolved and her abdomen is benign with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 7
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 120
s to 130s,
   likely volume depletion as above. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring
   anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   - Heparin gtt restarted after trach placement.  Will also start
   coumadin today for a goal INR of [**2-10**].
   - If she remains tachycardic after IVF, can consider adding a small
   dose of metoprolol for rate control.
   # Anemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, recently diagnosed with pneumonia after tracheostomy placement. The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for over two weeks. She has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia, completed an 8-day course of meropenem and vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**]. A bronchoscopy was performed to attempt to open her right lower lobe, and secretions were suctioned. Due to her inability to be weaned from the ventilator, a tracheostomy was placed yesterday.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. There is a potential complication of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) as she has chronic right lower lobe collapse and pneumonia.
2. Volume Overload: The patient has positive fluid balance with 9.6 L for LOS and diffuse edematousness. This indicates potential volume overload, which can lead to heart failure or pulmonary edema.
3. Tachycardia: The patient is tachycardic, likely from intravascular volume depletion. This can be a sign of hypovolemia or heart failure.
4. Drug Rash: The patient had a drug rash likely secondary to c"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who has been admitted to the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, attributed to pneumonia, atelectasis, and congestive heart failure. The patient is currently intubated and receiving supportive care, including diuretics to manage fluid balance. They have undergone percutaneous tracheostomy and are now on a tracheostomy tube. The patient also has anemia, a rash attributed to antibiotics (resolved), Clostridium difficile infection, and atrial fibrillation, which is being rate-controlled with digoxin and anticoagulated with Coumadin. Nutritional support is being provided through total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to the tracheostomy. The patient's CVA is stable with no evidence of new neurological events. The patient's code status is full code, and they will remain in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's persistent respiratory failure poses a significant risk. Despite being intubated, there is a possibility of further deterioration or complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or ventilator-induced lung injury.

2. Anemia: The patient's low hemoglobin levels indicate anemia, which can lead to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and tissue hypoxia. Monitoring Hct serially is recommended, but it is crucial to investigate the underlying cause of the anemia and provide appropriate treatment.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia s/p
   trach placement [**1-13**].
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy to
   attempt to open her RLL last weekend and had secretions suctioned.
   Given that she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator for > 2
   weeks she had a trach placed [**1-13**].  Patient had a trial of CPAP
   yesterday for 4 hours, however she had apneic episodes and was placed
   back on pressure support.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative as below to improve volume overload
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP/Tachycardia:
   The patient
s BP has been generally well controlled.  She was slighly
   slightly positive yesterday and is still difusely edematous with fluid
   balance of positive 10.5 L for LOS.  She remained tachycardic yesterday
   even after a small fluid bolus and has a history of a.fib.
   - Given that her tachycardia did not improve with fluids and she has
   remained tachycardic with an episode in the 130
s, her tachycardia is
   less likely to be due to intravascular volume depletion and more likely
   secondary to her underlying a.fib.   Can consider starting a low dose
   of metoprolol if she continues to be tachycardic.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 cc to 1 L negative, will given lasix 10 mg IV
   once now with reassessment of I/Os in the afternoon.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to previsous episodes of
   hypotension
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na has decreased to 130 today from 132
   from 136.  She is volume overloaded, but does not appear to have CHF,
   cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, so she most likely has SIADH.  Also
   her K is low, making adrenal insufficiency unlikely.
   - Will give 10 mg IV lasix x 1, with afternoon reassessment of I/Os for
   a goal diuresis of 500 cc to 1 L negative to attempt to get rid of free
   water.
   # Rash:
   The patient
s rash is much improved.  Likely secondary to a cefepime
   drug rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Diarrhea is resolved and her abdomen is benign with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 8
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 100
s to 130s;
   as above as she did not respond to fluids yesterday, this is more
   likely due to her underlying a.fib. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring
   anticoagulation.  INR of 1.4 today.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.  Can consider a small dose of metoprolol if she is
   peristently tachy.
   -  Continue coumadin for a goal INR of [**2-10**].
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 24.9 today (was 23.7 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure, following a recent diagnosis of pneumonia after tracheostomy placement.

The patient has been on mechanical ventilation for over two weeks and had a trial of CPAP that was unsuccessful due to an increase in apneic episodes. She is currently on pressure support.

She has allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and cefepime, and has received antibiotics including metronidazole and vancomycin.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 107 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 143/71 mmHg to 154/80 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.

Her physical examination reveals diffuse 2+ pitting edema, an erythematous rash now improved with some residual desquamation, and signs of volume overload.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, normal platelet count, and abnormal liver function tests. Electrolytes indicate hyponatremia (Na+ of 130), hypokalemia (K+ of 3.6), and normal magnesium and phosphate levels.

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia s/p
   trach placement yesterday.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy to
   attempt to open her RLL last weekend and had secretions suctioned.
   Given that she was unable to be weaned from the ventilator for > 2
   weeks she had a trach placed [**1-13**].  Patient had a trial of CPAP
   yesterday for 4 hours, however she had apneic episodes and was placed
   back on pressure support.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - goal of 500 cc to 1 L negative as below to improve volume overload
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   # Volume status/BP/Tachycardia:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was slighly
   slightly positive yesterday and is still difusely edematous with fluid
   balance of positive 10.5 L for LOS.  She remained tachycardic yesterday
   even after a small fluid bolus and has a history of a.fib.
   - Given that her tachycardia did not improve with fluids and she has
   remained tachycardic with an episode in the 130
s, her tachycardia is
   less likely to be due to intravascular volume depletion and more likely
   secondary to her underlying a.fib.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 cc to 1 L negative, once her HR normalizes,
   can restart a very low dose of lasix gtt.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to previsous episodes of
   hypotension
   # Hyponatremia:  The patient
s Na has decreased to 130 today from 132
   from 136.  She is volume overloaded, but does not appear to have CHF,
   cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, so she most likely has SIADH.
   # Rash:
   The patient
s rash is much improved.  Likely secondary to a cefepime
   drug rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Diarrhea is resolved and her abdomen is benign with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 8
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 100
s to 130s;
   as above as she did not respond to fluids yesterday, this is more
   likely due to her underlying a.fib. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring
   anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   -  Continue coumadin for a goal INR of [**2-10**].
   - As she has remained tachycardia after IVF, would start metoprolol
   12.5 [**Hospital1 **] for rate control and uptitrate as necessary.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 24.9 today (was 23.7 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, atrial fibrillation (AF), congestive heart failure (CHF), and Clostridium difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure in the setting of recent pneumonia and tracheostomy placement.

The patient has multiple medical complications that can arise from her current condition:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has chronic right lower lobe (RLL) collapse and pneumonia. She completed an 8-day course of meropenem and vancomycin but remains unable to be weaned from the ventilator. She had a trial of CPAP yesterday but experienced apneic episodes and was placed back on pressure support.

2. Volume status/BP/Tachycardia: The patient's BPs have been better controlled, but she still has positive fluid balance and diffuse edema. Her tachycardia is less likely due to intravascular volume depletion and more likely secondary to her underlying AF.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient's sodium level has decreased to 130 today from 132. She is volume overloaded but does not appear to have CHF, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, so she most likely has syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH).

4. Rash: The patient's rash is much improved and likely secondary to a cef"

   Assessment and Plan
   82 year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia s/p PEG, AF, CHF, and
   C. difficile infection/colitis who presented with unresponsiveness and
   respiratory failure in the setting of recent diagnosis of pneumonia s/p
   trach placement yesterday.
   # Respiratory failure:
   Has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed a 8 day course of
   Meropenem and Vancomycin on [**2195-1-7**].  Patient had a bronchoscopy
   recently to attempt to open her RLL and had secretions suctioned.
   Given that she was unalbe to be weaned from the ventilator for > 2
   weeks she had a trach placed yesterday.
   - Continue albuterol, ipratroprium inhalers
   - goal of 500 cc - 1 L negative as below to improve volume overload
   - VAP precautions
   - Chest PT
   - Will do a trial of PS to see if she can generate adequate tidal
   volume to be weaned off eventually to a trach mask.
   # Volume status/BP/Tachycardia:
   The patient
s BPs have been better controlled.  She was 2 L negative
   yesterday however still difusely edematous with fluid balance of
   positive 9.6 L for LOS.  With the 2 L of diuresis yesterday she has
   become tachycardic, likely from intrvascular volume depletion.
   - Hold diuresis currently and will give a 250 cc NS bolus for likely
   intravascular volume depletion.
   - Continue BP monitoring
   - Goal I/O should be 500 cc to 1 L negative, once her HR normalizes,
   can restart a very low dose of lasix gtt.
   - Holding lisinopril, carvedilol due to previsou episodes of
   hypotension
   # Rash:
   The patient
s rash is much improved.  Likely secondary to a cefepime
   drug rash. Cefepime was stopped on [**1-1**].
   - Continue eucerin cream daily
   # C Diff colitis:
   Diarrhea is resolved and her abdomen is benign with no signs of
   worsening colitis.
   - Two week course of Vancomycin PO and Metronidazole PO started on
   [**2195-1-8**], now day 7
   - Probiotics via PEG- provided by family.
   # Afib - On digoxin. Hemodynamically stable and rate in 120
s to 130s,
   likely volume depletion as above. CHADS2 score > 4, requiring
   anticoagulation.
   -  Continue digoxin; will hold of on additional rate control agents
   given her history of labile pressures as she is being actively
   diuresed.
   - Heparin gtt restarted after trach placement.  Will also start
   coumadin today for a goal INR of [**2-10**].
   - If she remains tachycardic after IVF, can consider adding a small
   dose of metoprolol for rate control.
   # Anemia
 HCT stable at 23.7 today (was 24.8 yesterday).  Her Hct was
   in the low 30
s on admission and has trended downward over her stay.
   No clinical evidence of bleeding.  Likely secondary to her acute
   illness.
   - Will continue to trend with a transfusion threshold of 21.
   - recheck HCT this morning
   - guiaic stools

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of CVA/dementia, AF, CHF, and C. difficile infection/colitis. She presented with unresponsiveness and respiratory failure after a recent diagnosis of pneumonia and tracheostomy placement. The patient has chronic RLL collapse and PNA and completed an 8-day course of Meropenem and Vancomycin. She was unable to be weaned from the ventilator for more than 2 weeks, so a tracheostomy was placed yesterday.

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure, volume status/BP/tachycardia, rash, C. difficile colitis, atrial fibrillation (AF), and anemia. She is currently on multiple medications including albuterol, ipratropium inhalers, diuretics, VAP precautions, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient's recent lab results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin, and normal platelet count.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's inability to be weaned from the ventilator indicates a severe respiratory condition. She may require ongoing respiratory support and may need further interventions to improve her lung function.

2. Volume status/BP/Tachycardia: The patient has positive fluid balance and is edematous. She is also experiencing tachycardia, likely due to intr"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient tolerated CPAP for 4 hours yesterday but was changed back to MMV due to apneic spells.
- The patient has a history of allergies to penicillins, erythromycin base, and cefepime. The last doses of antibiotics administered were vancomycin and metronidazole.
- The patient is receiving various medications including Coumadin (warfarin), Lansoprazole (Prevacid), fentanyl patch, digoxin, Atrovent, Lactobacillus, and RISS.
- The patient's vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 114/44 mmHg to 154/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.
- Fluid balance shows an intake of 1,492 mL and output of 1,225 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 267 mL.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, peak inspiratory pressure of 19 cmH2O, plateau pressure of 18 cmH2O, and respiratory system compliance of 30.8 cmH2O/mL. The patient's ABG results show a pH of 7.26, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 40 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 120 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 100%.
- The patient's blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 86 mg/dL and 130 mg/dL.
- Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 6.8-7.3 K/uL, hemoglobin level of 7.9 g/dL, platelet count of 392-427 K/uL, creatinine level of 0.2 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 26 mg/dL.
- The patient has profound hypo-albuminemia with an albumin level of 1.8 g/dL.
- The patient's electrolytes include sodium levels ranging from 129-133 mEq/L, potassium levels ranging from 3.6-3.7 mEq/L, chloride levels ranging from 98-102 mEq/L, and bicarbonate levels ranging from 22-24 mEq/L.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has been intubated for prolonged periods and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The respiratory system compliance is low, indicating possible lung injury or difficulty weaning from the ventilator.

2. Fluid balance issue: The patient has a negative fluid balance, which may indicate dehydration or inadequate fluid replacement. This could lead to complications such as renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalances.

3. Hypoalbuminemia: The patient has a significantly low albumin level, indicating poor nutritional status or chronic illness. Hypoalbuminemia can contribute to edema, poor wound healing, and increased susceptibility to infections.

4. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is in atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. This arrhythmia increases the risk of thromboembolic events and requires rate control to prevent hemodynamic instability.

5. Hyponatremia: The patient has low sodium"
