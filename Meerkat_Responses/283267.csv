   Assessment and Plan
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 ANEMIA, ACUTE, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING)
 [**Last Name 9**] PROBLEM - ENTER DESCRIPTION IN COMMENTS
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
 FEVER, UNKNOWN ORIGIN (FUO, HYPERTHERMIA, PYREXIA)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and a history of CABG and recent NSTEMI. She was transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, anemia, acute respiratory failure, fever of unknown origin, and leukocytosis. The patient has a history of heart block and is on a dual-chamber pacer. She has been diagnosed with 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. The patient's rhythm is AFIB with intermittent pacing. She has oliguric renal failure and an elevated PTT. The patient also has anemia and a positive guaiac.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic shock, hypovolemia, or septic shock. Continuous monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation with careful attention to urine output are necessary.
2. Anemia: The patient's anemia may be secondary to blood loss from hemorrhage or bleeding. Blood transfusion may be required to maintain adequate oxygen-carrying capacity.
3. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may be due to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, pneumonia, or sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is crucial."

   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in

   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear

   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).

   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. She presented to the ICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. She has been diagnosed with hypotension, acute anemia secondary to blood loss, CAD, and respiratory failure. 

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is likely due to hypovolemia, but infection cannot be completely ruled out. Close monitoring of fluid status and cautious intravenous fluid administration are necessary.
2. Acute Anemia: The patient's anemia is secondary to blood loss. It is important to continue blood product transfusions as needed and monitor hemoglobin levels.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and recent non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Continuous monitoring of cardiac status and management of blood pressure and heart rate are essential.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient has acute respiratory failure, and close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary. Consideration for diagnostic thoracentesis may be required.
5. Leukocytosis: The cause of leukocytosis needs to be determined, and appropriate antibiotic coverage should be continued. cultures should be followed up.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). She was transferred to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) due to hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap metabolic acidosis, and increased leukocytosis. The patient has been receiving fluid resuscitation and packed red blood cells (pRBCs) but still has poor urine output. She has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, possibly not related to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is being treated with empiric antibiotics for fever of unknown origin. The patient also has leukocytosis, which may be due to Clostridioides difficile infection or another cause. She has a history of congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation with heart block, and is currently being paced. The patient is oliguric with pre-renal azotemia and has elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels. Her prothrombin time (PT) is prolonged, and she has anemia with a positive guaiac test, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding.

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypotension. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently receiving treatment for several medical conditions, including anemia secondary to blood loss, coronary artery disease, fever of unknown origin, and acute respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure of 83/47 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is also receiving medications such as norepinephrine, cefepime, and vancomycin.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is low, indicating hypotension. This can lead to inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction if not promptly addressed.
2. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. If left untreated, anemia can result in reduced oxygen delivery to tissues and organs, leading to organ dysfunction.
3. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, which increases the risk of myocardial ischemia and potential heart attack. This condition requires ongoing management to prevent further cardiac complications.
4. Fever of Unknown Origin (FUO): The patient's persistent fever suggests an underlying infection or inflammatory process. Identifying the source of infection is crucial to initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy and prevent complications"

   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   # Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemic, but given elevated WBC count,
   cannot r/o septic physiology.  IVF overnight, now in mild heart
   failure.  EKG and troponins argue against cardiogenic component.
   - 1 unit PRBC, neo to keep MAP > 55, judicious IVF given mild CHF
   - Empiric Vanco & Cefepime
   - F/U cultures
   - R/O ACS
   - TTE to r/o pericardial effusion
   # Leukocytosis: Must consider infectious etiology/septic shock given
   pressor requirement.  Recent instrumentation with pacer placement.
   Elevated LFTs.  L effusion.  C. diff negative.  No localizing symptoms.
   - Empiric abx coverage with vanc/cefepime
   - Consider abd US if WBC elevation and elevated LFTs persist
   - Consider diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) **] on L if persistent leukocytosis and pressor
   requirement
   - F/U blood/urine cultures
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component of contrast nephropathy.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Judicious IVF
   - Renal c/s today
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts.
   - Continue Asa, Plavix, Lipitor
   - Hold ACE/metoprolol
   # CHF: Mild pulmonary edema and elevated JVP.
   - Hold IVF and use pressors or hypotension.
   # Arrhythmia: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer. S/p EP
   interrogation today. Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per
   EP, this is part of rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning
   appropriatley. Would benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that
   cardiology team deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic
   +.
   - Appreciate EP input.
   # Elevated LFTs: Possibly related to hypotension.  Unlikely to be
   indication of infection.
   - Will follow
   - Consider abd u/s as above
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She was initially admitted to the MICU for pneumonia (PNA), hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), acute renal failure (ARF), congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), bradycardia requiring temporary pacemaker wire, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). She was later transferred to the floor but returned to the ICU due to acute-on-chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap metabolic acidosis, and increased leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite IV fluid resuscitation, which may indicate hypovolemic shock. Given the elevated white blood cell count, there is also a possibility of septic physiology. The patient is receiving norepinephrine to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55 mmHg and will continue to receive judicious IV fluids to manage mild heart failure. Empiric antibiotic coverage with vancomycin and cefepime has been initiated, and further cultures are pending. It is important to rule out acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and consider"

   76 y/o, female with history of CAD s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma visiting
   from [**Location (un) 9832**], originally admitted to MICU for PNA, hypercarbic
   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   # Hypotension: Most likely hypovolemic, but given elevated WBC count,
   cannot r/o septic physiology.  IVF overnight, now in mild heart
   failure.  EKG and troponins argue against cardiogenic component.
   - 1 unit PRBC, neo to keep MAP > 55, judicious IVF given mild CHF
   - Empiric Vanco & Cefepime
   - F/U cultures
   - R/O ACS
   - TTE to r/o pericardial effusion
   # Leukocytosis: Must consider infectious etiology/septic shock given
   pressor requirement.  Recent instrumentation with pacer placement.
   Elevated LFTs.  L effusion.  C. diff negative.  No localizing symptoms.
   - Empiric abx coverage with vanc/cefepime
   - Consider abd US if WBC elevation and elevated LFTs persist
   - Consider diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) **] on L if persistent leukocytosis and pressor
   requirement
   - F/U blood/urine cultures
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  [**Month (only) 8**] also be a component of contrast nephropathy.
   - [**Hospital1 **] creatinine
   - Judicious IVF
   - Renal c/s today
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts.
   - Continue Asa, Plavix, Lipitor
   - Hold ACE/metoprolol
   # CHF: Mild pulmonary edema and elevated JVP.
   - Hold IVF and use pressors or hypotension.
   # Arrhythmia: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer. S/p EP
   interrogation today. Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per
   EP, this is part of rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning
   appropriatley. Would benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that
   cardiology team deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic
   +.
   - Appreciate EP input.
   # Elevated LFTs: Possibly related to hypotension.  Unlikely to be
   indication of infection. ? congestive hepatopathy
   - Will follow
   - Consider abd u/s as above
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH and monitor PTT.
   # Anemia: Guiaic +. If requires long term coumadin, colonoscopy should
   be expedited for soon after d/c.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise for this patient:

1. Hypotension: The patient is experiencing persistent hypotension despite receiving IV fluids and norepinephrine. This could indicate septic shock or hypovolemic shock. The elevated WBC count and elevated LFTs suggest an infectious etiology.

2. Oliguric renal failure: The patient's urine output is low, suggesting pre-renal etiology. The elevated creatinine levels indicate renal dysfunction. It is important to manage fluid balance carefully and consider renal catheterization for further evaluation.

3. Leukocytosis: The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, which may be due to an infection or sepsis. Empiric antibiotic coverage with Vancomycin and Cefepime is being administered, and cultures are being followed up to identify the causative organism.

4. Cardiac issues: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease with previous CABG surgery, hypertension, and asthma. The EKG and troponin levels argue against a cardiogenic component of the hypotension, but ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary. The patient also has atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response and requires rate-responsive pacing.

5. Pulmonary edema: The patient has increased bilateral opacities on chest X-ray consistent with pulmonary edema, possibly secondary to congestive heart failure. Monitoring and managing fluid intake carefully is crucial"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient presents with hypotension and is currently in the ICU. The renal consultant suspects prerenal azotemia due to poor oral intake, hypotension, and the presence of WBC casts in the urine. An allergic interstitial nephritis (AIN) is also considered, and eosinophils have been sent for testing. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and 500 cc of normal saline (NS) at 100 cc/hr overnight. The patient's blood pressure briefly returned to a normal range after receiving PRBCs.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure (ARF): The patient's renal function is compromised, as indicated by elevated serum creatinine levels and the presence of WBC casts in the urine.
2. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure remains low, indicating potential inadequate tissue perfusion.
3. Anemia: The patient has an acute anemia secondary to blood loss, which could be a result of hemorrhage.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD, putting them at risk for ischemic heart disease.
5. Fever of unknown origin (FUO): The patient has had intermittent fevers, indicating a possible underlying infection or inflammatory process.
6. Acute respiratory failure: The patient may be experiencing respiratory failure, although it is not specified as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 76**])
   76 yo F with ischemic cardiomyopathy EF=25-30%, CAD s/ CABG & s/p
   NSTEMI w/in the last week, heart block s/p dual-chamber pacer
   transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new
   anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.
   .
   # Hypotension: Distributive and cardiogenic etiologies must be
   considered in the pt with CHF, CAD, recent PNA, and marked
   leukocytosis. Most likely hypovolemic given physical exam, urine sodium
   of 11, decreased po intake, and orthostasis. SVO2 imprved with IVF from
   60 to 65. Neck veins initially flat, now with JVP~14cm.
   --Although most likely hypovolemic, cannot truly exclude infection in
   this pt with WBC 25: Empiric Vanco & Cefepime (d1=[**11-15**]),
   --Cautious IVF to achieve improved UOP (if possible, oliguria may also
   be intrarenal)
   --trying to avoid perihperal pressor given SVO2, but  chose neo if
   necessary as already tachycardic and s/p recent NSTEMI; will recheck
   SVO2 on Neo, anticipate that it will go down
   --ROMI: Initial Trop still elevated, but down-trending, slow decline
   not surprising given renal failure. CK/MB flat.
   .
   # Leukocytosis: Etilogy of leukocytosis was unclear even before acute
   jump from 18 to 28 today.  Does raise suspicion for CDIFF.  Less likely
   would be acute rxn to pacer implantation yesterday--too early to invoke
   infectious process in pacer pocket, moreover, does not appear
   infected.  Lines could have been a source, but BCX on [**11-12**] NGTD and
   pending from [**11-15**].
   --Empiric Abx covg as above, f/u cultures
   --LFTs with mild new transaminitis but normal bili, alk phos arguing
   against biliary process. That said, would image, if WBC persists. Trend
   LFTs (could be [**1-29**] to hypotension/hypoperfusion)
   --Would also consider diagnostic thoracentesis as this effusion has
   persisted despite otherwise effective diuresis.
   --f/u BCX/UCX, no sputum ordered as do not suspect lung gicen stable
   resp stutus and imprving CXR
   .
   # CAD: 3VD of both native vessels and grafts. EKG not overtly
   concerning for ischemia, but difficult to interpret in setting of LBBB.
   --ASA, PLAVIX, LIPITOR 80, HOLD ACEi, Metoprolol with high hold
   parameters.
   .
   # CHF: Currrently dry as above. Holding ACEI given BP and ARF, but will
   resume ASAP. Holding parameters for BB. As above, will carefully
   monitor fluid status with repletion given hx of flash pulm edema.
   - Given low EF, her tolerance of afib may be limited and forward flow
   may improve with restoration of atrial kick; consdier discussing
   elective cardioversion with EP (would require TEE).
   .
   Rhythm: AFIB, Heart Block s/p dual chamber pacer: S/p EP interogation.
   Intermittently pacing fast at variable rates. Per EP, this is part of
   rate-responsive algorithm and is functioning appropriatley. Would
   benefit from coumadin in long run, but seems that cardiology team
   deferred for now given persistently low Hct and guiaic +.
   --metoprolol with high BP hold parameter
   --d/w EP, perhaps max rate could be lowered as she is fairly inactive
   at baseline and is pacing to 100s at rest.
   .
   # Oliguric Renal Failure: Urine sodium=11 suggesting pre-renal
   etiology.  That said, absence of aggressive diuresis recently and
   contrast load 48-72 hrs ago argue for some element of contrast
   nephropathy.  Oliguria somewhat improved s/p IVF but UOP still <30 at
   this time and O2 requirement slightly increased.
   --continue to trend.
   --small boluses to achive increase in UOP (cautiously [**1-29**] CHF and resp
   status)
   --repeat urine lytes
   --consider renal c/s if UOP fails to improve
   --trend UOP on low-dose neo, doubt this will have a significant effect
   --Avoid nephrotoxins, renally dose
   .
   # Elevated PTT: Noted previously. SQH d/c by floor team for this
   reason. Will restart SQH [**Hospital1 **] over tid and monitor PTT.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, anion gap metabolic acidosis, and leukocytosis. The patient has multiple comorbidities including congestive heart failure (CHF), acute renal failure (ARF), anemia secondary to blood loss, fever of unknown origin (FUO), and respiratory failure. She is currently receiving vasopressor support and has had multiple interventions to optimize her condition.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure requires close monitoring and ongoing management with vasopressors. There is a risk of further hypotension and potential organ hypoperfusion.
2. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's oliguria and elevated serum creatinine suggest AKI. Close monitoring of renal function and aggressive fluid resuscitation may be necessary to prevent further deterioration.
3. Infection: The patient's leukocytosis and fever raise concerns for an infectious process. Empiric antibiotic therapy has been initiated, and cultures are pending. There is a risk of worsening infection and sepsis.
4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient's history of CAD and recent NSTEMI make her susceptible to recurrent ischemic events. Continuous monitoring of cardiac status and consideration"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous CABG surgery. She presented to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. The patient's condition is complicated by multiple comorbidities including CHF, CAD, recent pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation with heart block.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to cardiogenic causes such as poor forward flow secondary to low ejection fraction (EF) and atrial fibrillation. Other possible causes include fluid overload or intravascular depletion. The patient is already receiving phenylephrine infusion to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60 mmHg and diuretics to manage fluid balance.
2. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely pre-renal in origin, as indicated by a urine sodium level of 11. However, contrast nephropathy may also be a contributing factor. Diuretics, particularly lasix, are being used to promote diuresis and improve urine output.
3. Anemia: The patient has developed acute anemia secondary to blood loss. A guaiac test was positive, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. Colonoscopy may be necessary if long-term anticoagulation is required.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count ranging from 11.8 to 24.3 K/uL. The etiology of leukocytosis is unclear, and there is no evidence of infection. Antibiotics (Vanc and Cefepime) have been discontinued for now.
5. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has significant CAD involving both native vessels and grafts. ASA, Plavix, and Lipitor are being held temporarily. Further intervention may be required to manage the patient's CAD.
6. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF): The patient is currently fluid overloaded and will be carefully monitored for signs of fluid overload. Diuretics and fluid restriction are part of the management plan.
7. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB) and Heart Block: The patient has AFIB with heart block, which has been managed with a dual-chamber pacer. The pacing rate has been set at 60 beats per minute.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the information provided in the progress note. Additional tests and evaluations may be necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the patient's condition."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of CAD, s/p CABG, HTN, and asthma. She was admitted to the MICU for PNA, hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia requiring temporary pacer wire, and afib with RVR. The patient then went to the floor, got a cath, and had a pacer placed before being readmitted to the ICU with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension may be due to an underfilled or overfilled left ventricle. Resuscitation with PRBC and IVF has been initiated, and the goal is to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 55 and target blood volume (TBB). Monitoring and adjusting the pressor requirement will be important.

2. Oliguric Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric acute renal failure may be caused by cardiorenal syndrome plus possible contrast nephropathy. Diuresis will be continued and monitored, and a renal ultrasound will be performed.

3. Coronary Artery Disease/Ischemic Cardiomyopathy: The patient has significant coronary artery disease with three-vessel disease involving both native vessels and grafts. An ejection"

   respiratory failure (intubated), ARF, CHF, NSTEMI, bradycardia
   requiring temp pacer wire, and afib with RVR.  Went to floor [**11-11**] -
   got cath, pacer placed and then bounced back to us from [**Hospital Ward Name **] 3 [**11-15**]
   with acute on CRI, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap,
   and increased leukocytosis.
   Hypotension- DDx includes underfilled vs overfilled LV. Initially
   resuscitated w/ PRBC and IVF and now with incr dypnea. I suspect more
   of a cardiorenal picture at this point as well as low oncotic pressure.
   HR control also important to aid filling. Doubt sepsis given lack of
   symptoms, signs suggsting infxn

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) post coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for pneumonia (PNA), hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), acute renal failure (ARF), congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), bradycardia requiring temporary pacing wire, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (AF with RVR). The patient was later transferred to the floor, underwent cardiac catheterization and placement of a permanent pacemaker, and then returned to the ICU due to acute-on-chronic cardiorenal syndrome, hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to an underfilled or overfilled left ventricle. Resuscitation with packed red blood cells (PRBC) and intravenous fluids (IVF) has been initiated. Monitoring for improvement in blood pressure and urine output is essential. The patient's low oncotic pressure should also be considered.

2. Cardiorenal Syndrome: The patient's oliguric acute renal failure may be associated with cardiorenal syndrome, especially given the presence of chronic systolic heart failure."

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). She was transferred to the MICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. The patient has been diagnosed with acute renal failure, hypotension, anemia secondary to blood loss, coronary artery disease, and respiratory failure. She also has a history of heart block and a dual-chamber pacer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's oliguric renal failure is likely due to pre-renal causes, possibly related to volume depletion and contrast-induced nephropathy. It is important to avoid nephrotoxins and dose medications accordingly.

2. Hypotension: The patient's initial hypotension was volume depleted, but subsequent fluid repletion led to some degree of fluid overload. Careful monitoring of fluid status is necessary to prevent further complications.

3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia secondary to blood loss. If long-term coumadin therapy is required, a colonoscopy should be expedited for soon after discharge.

4. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has significant CAD with 3-vessel disease involving both native vessels and grafts. EKG findings are not overtly concerning for ischemia, but the interpretation is difficult due to left bundle"

","Summary:
The patient is a 62-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure, hypotension, anemia secondary to blood loss, coronary artery disease, fever of unknown origin, and acute respiratory failure. The patient has been receiving various treatments and interventions, including Lasix infusion, heparin sodium for prophylaxis, and other medications. The patient's vital signs are stable, but they have shown fluctuations in blood pressure. Laboratory results indicate abnormal values in kidney function, electrolytes, and other parameters. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple medical complications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute renal failure: The patient is experiencing decreased kidney function, which can lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances, increased risk of infections, and potential progression to chronic renal failure if not managed appropriately.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may indicate poor perfusion and oxygenation of vital organs. This can increase the risk of organ damage and failure if not corrected promptly.
3. Anemia secondary to blood loss: The patient has experienced significant blood loss, leading to a decrease in red blood cell count. This can result in fatigue, weakness, and impaired oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Coronary artery disease: The patient's history of CAD increases the risk of myocardial infarction or other cardiac events during periods of stress or instability.
5. Fever of unknown origin: The patient's persistent fever requires further investigation to identify the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease (CAD), and previous cardiac interventions. She was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis. The patient's vital signs include a heart rate of 99 bpm, blood pressure of 91/42 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on nasal cannula. She is currently in atrial fibrillation with a low ejection fraction (EF) of 25-30%. The patient has renal failure, anemia secondary to blood loss, CAD, fever of unknown origin, and respiratory failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure could be due to cardiogenic causes such as heart failure or ischemic heart disease. Further assessment is needed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.

2. Renal Failure: The patient has acute renal failure, which may be caused by factors such as decreased urine output, pre-renal etiology, or contrast nephropathy. Close monitoring of fluid status, diuresis with Lasix, and avoiding nephrotoxins are recommended.

3. Anemia: The patient has acute anemia likely secondary to blood loss. It is important to address this issue, especially if long-term anticoagulation is required, as"

","Summary:
The patient is a 76-year-old female with a history of coronary artery disease post coronary artery bypass graft (CAD s/p CABG), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She was admitted to the MICU for pneumonia (PNA), hypercarbic respiratory failure (intubated), acute renal failure (ARF), congestive heart failure (CHF), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), bradycardia requiring temporary pacemaker wire, and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (afib with RVR). She was transferred to the floor, got a catheter placed, and then returned to the ICU on [**11-15**] with acute on chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), hypotension, decreased urine output, new anion gap, and increased leukocytosis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension could be due to a cardiorenal picture, improved after diuresis. It is important to monitor the patient's blood pressure and maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 55. Ongoing assessment of renal function is necessary.
2. Oliguric acute renal failure: The patient's decreased urine output could be attributed to cardiorenal syndrome plus possible contrast nephropathy. Diuretics may be used to improve renal function, and the renal ultrasound did not show any abnormalities.
3. Transaminitis: The"
