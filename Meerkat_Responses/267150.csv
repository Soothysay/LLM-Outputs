","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is admitted for melena, which raises concerns about an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. The patient complains of abdominal pain but is otherwise well. They have allergies to aspirin, ibuprofen, gabapentin, and Tylenol (oral), with unknown reactions. The patient is currently receiving octreotide infusion and other ICU medications.

The vital signs show a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 70 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/60 mmHg to 82/32 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm, and they have received a total of 1,542 mL of fluids, including 732 mL of intravenous fluids and 750 mL of blood products. There is no urine output recorded.

The physical examination reveals slight crackles at the right base of the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. The patient's neurologic examination shows slowed speech but comprehensible, without asterixis.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.7 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL, hematocrit of 22.2%, platelet count of 52 K/uL, blood glucose level of 156 mg/dL, sodium level of 135 mEq/L, potassium level of 4.2 mEq/L, chloride level of 103 mEq/L, and a slightly elevated creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL. Other lab values include prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), as well as low calcium and magnesium levels.

The assessment and plan indicate a likely upper GI bleed, possibly due to esophageal varices with recent manipulation. The patient's hematocrit is lower than baseline, but there is no evidence of active bleeding during an endoscopy. The goal is to maintain active tracking and serial hemoglobin measurements every six hours until stabilized. The patient will receive two units of red blood cells, with a target hematocrit of more than 21 (unless the rate of bleeding is faster, in which case the goal hematocrit will be 24-27). The patient will also continue to receive octreotide and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, with the gastrointestinal team aware of the situation and planning for a possible scope in the morning.

Additional assessments and plans include monitoring for hepatic encephalopathy due to cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis, which may require evaluation for liver transplant. The patient is also being monitored for diabetes, neuropathy, and nutrition, and will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) while waiting for the scope. Prophylaxis measures include stress ulcer and venous thromboembolism (DVT) prevention.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided include worsening upper GI bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, infection (such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis), and hypotension."

His platelet count is 52 K/uL, INR is 1.6, and electrolyte levels are within normal range.

The patient has multiple medical conditions that require ongoing management:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB): likely upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source due to known esophageal varices with recent manipulation. The patient's hemoglobin level is lower than baseline, indicating ongoing blood loss. He will be monitored closely with serial hemoglobin measurements every six hours.
2. Esophageal varices: the patient is at high risk for rebleeding. Prophylactic measures such as maintaining two large-bore IV lines, administering two units of packed red blood cells, and initiating octreotide and intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy have been started. A gastrointestinal team is aware of the situation, and"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female with a history of cirrhosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and Hepatitis C infection. She was admitted to the ICU for suspected gastrointestinal bleeding due to known esophageal varices. The patient underwent an endoscopy, which showed evidence of large erosion extending past the junction, suggesting a potential source of bleeding. An abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate if the patient is a candidate for the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. The patient is having difficulty coping with the new finding of worsening varices and has been consulting with a social worker.

The patient has allergies to aspirin, ibuprofen, gabapentin, and Tylenol. She received 100mcg of fentanyl and 3mg of versed during the endoscopy and was hemodynamically stable. The patient is experiencing cramping abdominal pain and has been given D5 1/2NS for maintenance fluids, with clear liquids following the abdominal ultrasound.

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (Tmax) of 36.3°C (97.4°F) and current temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate (HR) of 69 bpm with a range of 67-73 bpm, blood pressure (BP) ranging from 104/64 mmHg to 117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate (RR) of 14 breaths per minute with a range of 11-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 3,621 mL and output of 445 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 3,621 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory support with supplemental oxygen but not on mechanical ventilation.

Physical examination findings include no acute distress, thin build, PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, and no murmurs or abnormal breath sounds. The patient has soft, non-tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds and absent peripheral pulses on the right lower extremity. Neurologic examination reveals attentive behavior, oriented to person, place, and time, and slightly slowed speech but comprehensible.

Laboratory results show a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2.7 K/uL, hemoglobin (Hgb) level of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 52 K/uL, creatinine (Cr) level of 1.0 mg/dL, blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL, and other laboratory values within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient has multiple medical conditions, including gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) likely from an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) source, hepatic encephalopathy, portal vein thrombosis (P"

","The patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C cirrhosis and portal vein thrombosis admitted for upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). The patient underwent an endoscopy, which revealed a large erosion involving the gastroesophageal junction. The patient received 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and is currently stable. 

The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature ranging from 35.3 to 36.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate between 67-73 beats per minute, blood pressure fluctuating between 91/46-117/70 mmHg, respiratory rate between 11-20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm.

The patient's fluid balance shows a total intake of 3,621 mL and output of 445 mL since 12 AM. The respiratory support includes oxygen delivery without any devices, and the patient's ABG results are unavailable.

Physical examination reveals no acute distress, thin appearance, and evidence of crackles at the right base with clear breath sounds bilaterally. The patient has a soft, non-tender abdomen that is distended with hyperactive bowel sounds. There is no edema in the extremities, and the patient is alert and oriented with no asterixis.

Laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 2.7, hemoglobin of 8.2 g/dL, platelet count of 52,000, creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL, glucose of 100 mg/dL, and sodium/potassium levels within normal range. Other lab values are also provided.

The patient's assessment includes ongoing monitoring of vital signs, blood counts, and coagulation parameters. The patient will continue receiving octreotide and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The plan is to evaluate the patient for liver transplant due to end-stage liver disease (ESLD) and portal vein thrombosis, which are secondary to ethanol and Hepatitis C. The patient is being monitored for hepatic encephalopathy and will continue lactulose therapy. Antibiotics are being administered for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Lasix, spironolactone, and nadolol are being withheld due to hypotension with bleeding, but may be restarted slowly. Low molecular weight heparin (lovenox) is also being held during gastrointestinal bleeding.

The patient's diabetes management includes sliding scale insulin (SSI) and long-acting insulin glargine at a reduced dose when nil per os (NPO). The patient is also being treated for neuropathy, coping strategies, access issues, nutrition, prophylaxis measures, and code status."

   Assessment and Plan
   53 yo female with history of Hep C and EtOH related cirrhosis now
   presenting with melena and blood loss anemia.  She has EGD with
   evidence of significant recent bleeding from esophageal varices and
   findings on abdominal ultrasound suggesting partially occlusive portal
   venous thrombus.  This may in part be contributing to elevated portal
   venous pressures and recurrent bleeding seen.  The issue becomes one of
   considering risk/benefit of anticoagulation for thrombus in the setting
   of recent bleeding.  In addition, this was found in the setting of
   recent Lovenox dosing and will hold on further Lovenox at this time.
   1)GI Bleed
   -Sucralfate, Pantoprazole to continue
   -Would continue active T+S
   -Is encouraging that patient has had reasonable stability of HCT and
   will continue q 6 hours
   -Hold Lovenox

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 53-year-old female with a history of Hepatitis C and alcohol-related cirrhosis. She presented with melena and blood loss anemia. The patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which revealed significant recent bleeding from esophageal varices. An ultrasound also showed a partially occlusive portal venous thrombus, which may be contributing to elevated portal venous pressures and recurrent bleeding.

The patient's current assessment and plan include the following:

1. GI Bleed:
   - Continue sucralfate and pantoprazole.
   - Active therapeutic phlebotomy every 6 hours.
   - Hold Lovenox (a blood thinner).
   - Transfuse packed red blood cells (T-Fuse) if hemoglobin drops to less than 21 or shows an acute drop.

2. Cirrhosis:
   - Restart nadolol (a beta-blocker).
   - Continue lactulose (a laxative).
   - Continue ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic).

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus type I, hepatic encephalopathy, anemia secondary to blood loss, esophageal varices, and other gastrointestinal bleeding.

In the ICU, the patient will receive nutrition support, insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, and will have central venous and arterial lines placed. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to Hepatitis C and alcohol use, who was admitted for recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. She continues to have melena and a dropping hematocrit level, indicating ongoing bleeding. The patient received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight. She has chronic coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia due to ESLD. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplant.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Upper GI bleed: The source of bleeding is known esophageal varices and ulcerations. The patient remains hemodynamically stable but continues to have melena and a dropping hematocrit level. She received pRBC and FFP overnight. The plan is to monitor her hemoglobin level every 4 hours and transfuse if it drops below 25. Protonix and octreotide IV are continued, along with sucralfate. Large-bore peripheral intravenous (PIV) lines are maintained, and active temperature and blood glucose monitoring is continued. Platelet transfusion is also planned.

2. End-stage liver disease (ESLD): The patient's liver disease is due to alcohol use and Hepatitis C. She is being evaluated for liver transplantation. She has grade III varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal vein"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to Hepatitis C and alcohol use, presenting with recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has known esophageal varices and ulcerations. On admission, she received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP). The patient continues to have melena and her hemoglobin concentration (Hct) is dropping. She is currently hemodynamically stable but has chronic coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia due to ESLD.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI Bleed: The patient has an ongoing upper GI bleed from a known esophageal varices and ulcerations source. She is being treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), octreotide, and sucralfate. Large-bore peripheral intravenous (PIVs) are maintained, and she is actively being transfused with platelets.
2. ESLD: The patient has ESLD due to alcohol use and Hepatitis C. She is being evaluated for liver transplantation but is not listed yet. She has grade III varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal vein thrombosis. Mild encephalopathy is present, but the patient seems clear upon arrival to the unit. She is receiving lactulose for the prevention of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SB"

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to Hepatitis C and ethanol abuse, presenting with recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has known esophageal varices and ulcerations. The patient was transferred to the ICU for management of her GI bleed. She continues to have melena and a decreasing hematocrit level despite being hemodynamically stable. She received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight. Chronic coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are present due to ESLD. The patient is being evaluated for liver transplantation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Upper GI bleed: The patient has a history of recurrent upper GI bleed due to esophageal varices and ulcerations. There is ongoing melena, indicating continued bleeding.
2. Anemia: The patient's hematocrit levels are decreasing, indicating ongoing blood loss and potential development of anemia.
3. Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient has a history of hepatic encephalopathy, a neurological disorder caused by liver dysfunction. It is characterized by altered mental status, confusion, and other cognitive impairments.
4. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): The patient has diabetes mellitus, type I, and may be at risk for DKA, particularly if not properly managed with insulin and glucose control.

","Summary:
The patient is a 52-year-old female with a history of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) secondary to Hepatitis C and alcohol use, who was transferred for recurrent upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. She has known esophageal varices and ulcerations. The patient is currently hemodynamically stable but continues to have melena and a dropping hematocrit level. She received 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBC) and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) overnight. She has chronic coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia due to ESLD.

Assessment and Plan:
1. GI bleed: The patient has an upper GI source given her known esophageal varices and ulcerations. She is being treated with proton pump inhibitors, octreotide, and sucralfate. Large-bore intravenous (IV) access is maintained, and she is actively being monitored for temperature and blood pressure.
2. ESLD: The patient's liver disease is due to alcohol use and Hepatitis C. She is currently being evaluated for liver transplantation but is not listed yet. She has grade III varices, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal vein thrombosis. She is mildly encephalopathic on the floor but seems clear on arrival to the unit.
3. Diabetes mellitus (DM): The patient has type I DM and is on insulin glargine 44 units per day at bedtime"
