   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with GPC bacteremia
   and neck pain.
   .
   1. Bacteremia. High-grade given that 2/2 bottles turned positive rather
   quickly. Unclear what the source is. MRI showed fluid collections
   around L4/5 similar to those seen last [**Month (only) 705**] just prior to his last
   admission for his abscesses but w/o clear signs of abscess. Hx for neck
   pain, mild HA, and fevers raises concern for meningitis, though he
   looks unusually well for this to be bact meningitis and
   Brudzinski/Kernig were neg. LP was not done in the ED given MR results
   and concern for spinal infection possible seeding into CSF with LP.
   Ceftriaxone and vanc were started in ED at meningitis doses.
   Endocarditis is also concerning given the history of valvular disease
   (through no clear murmur noted). Incomplete treatment of/recurrent
   osteomyelitis is also likely though pt had been on cefazolin for 8wks
   following prior admission ([**8-2**])
   - Repeat blood cultures.
   - Continue vancomycin given positive cultures; if returns MSSA can
   switch to better [**Doctor Last Name **] for sensitive staph (has received cephalosporins
   in the past)
   - f/u ID recs re LP recs and utility -> would need to do via IR given
   MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 7704**]
   - f/u MRI to determine if there is a clear source in spine; appreciate
   spine recs
   - f/u TTE
   - consider head MR (+/- contrast) given paraesthesias (see below)
   .
   2. Neck pain. Has had recurrent neck pain since initial hosp in [**March 2148**]. intensive PT has improved function/strength until recently.
   Limited ROM new to current presentation. Managed now on 8mg morphine
   Q4h. Given hx, concerning for recurrent epidural abscess.
   Trauma/compression fx also possible in light of previous C-spine
   disease. MSK etiology possible given intensive PT regimen and recent
   history of fall.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine PRN
   - f/u final read of C-spine MR
   .
   3. Paraesthesia. Possibly related to fall and/or known cervical
   disease. Other than subjective difference in sensation, exam is
   generally unremarkable with good strength. Concerning for peripheral
   (i.e c-spine stenosis/nerve compression) vs. central etiologies
   (infarct/abscess). Given apparent involvement of entire R side and hx,
   particularly concerned about a central process such as brain abscesses
   - f/u C-spine final read
   - head MR (+/- contrast) to assess brain lesion (infarct/abscess)
   .
   4. Anemia. Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   .
   5. Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   .
   6. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   .
   7. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, currently presenting with bacteremia and neck pain. The patient has been experiencing high-grade fever, mild headache, and neck pain, raising concerns for meningitis. However, he appears unusually well for this to be bacterial meningitis, and Brudzinski-Kernig signs were negative. A lumbar puncture was not performed in the emergency department due to MRI results suggesting a spinal infection, with concern for seeding into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with LP.

The patient also has a history of valvular disease, which raises concerns for endocarditis. Incomplete treatment of recurrent osteomyelitis is also likely, despite the patient having been on cefazolin for 8 weeks following a prior admission.

Repeat blood cultures have been ordered, and vancomycin has been continued given positive cultures. If the cultures return as MSSA, the antibiotic can be switched to a better option for sensitive staph (with the patient having received cephalosporins in the past). Further Infectious Disease recommendations regarding LP are pending, and consideration will be given to performing the procedure via interventional radiology (IR) due to the MRI findings.

Additionally, an MRI of the spine is recommended to determine if there is a clear source in the spine, and spine recommendations should be followed"

The patient's blood cultures have shown high-grade MSSA, and there are concerns for endocarditis and worsening mitral stenosis. He also has evidence of septic emboli on his right second toe. The patient's renal function has deteriorated, with an increase in serum creatinine from baseline. He has mild anemia, likely due to chronic inflammation, and hyponatremia. The patient is also experiencing acute renal failure, possibly related to his use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). There are concerns for osteomyelitis at the L5-S1 level, as well as chronic degenerative cervical spine disease causing neck pain and paraesthesia.

Potential Complications:
1. Worsening endocarditis leading to further septic emboli and organ dysfunction.
2. Progression of mitral stenosis due to the involvement of the tricuspid valve.
3. Development of multi-drug resistant bacteria due to inappropriate antibiotic use.
4. Complications from the planned transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), such as hypoxia or arrhythmias.
5. Chronic kidney disease if the acute renal failure persists or wors"

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with MSSA
   Endocarditis and neck pain.
   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.
   -Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Consider diureses today with 40mg IV lasix today, goal 2L
   negative
   # Endocarditis.   High-grade MSSA.  Vegitations on Mitral Valve per
   TEE.
   - Repeat blood cultures Q48
   - Continue gentamicin per ID
   - Nafcillin desensitization today
 Nafcillin dosing for MSSA
   - f/u ID recs
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and valium PRN
   - D/C lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to either SIADH in the setting of
   pain and pulmonary process or hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of CHF.
   -          Received fluid bolus yesterday and worsened, will volume
   restrict and diurese now
   #. Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   # Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   #. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   #. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.
   #. GERD. Continue Prilosec.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, now presenting with MSSA endocarditis and neck pain. The patient has been in the ICU for 24 hours and has been extubated without difficulty. He has received treatment with gentamicin and nafcillin. The patient's vital signs are stable, but he has mild hypoxia secondary to shunt physiology likely due to septic emboli from progressive endocarditis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to shunt physiology secondary to septic emboli from progressive endocarditis. Close monitoring of oxygen saturation and consideration of supplemental oxygen may be necessary.
2. Endocarditis: The patient has MSSA endocarditis with vegetations on the mitral valve. Long-term antibiotic therapy will be required, and repeat blood cultures every 48 hours are recommended. The patient should be monitored for signs of worsening endocarditis, such as fever, heart murmur, or embolic events.
3. Neck pain/Paraesthesia: The patient's neck pain and paraesthesia are likely secondary to chronic degenerative cervical spine disease. NSAIDs should be avoided due to acute renal failure, and alternative pain management strategies, such as morphine and valium, should be used as needed. Orthopedic consultation is recommended for further"

   Assessment and Plan
   52M with history of multiple MSSA infections, now with MSSA
   Endocarditis and neck pain.
   # Hypoxia:  Appears to be secondary to shunt physiology, most likely
   secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given
   new evidence off septic emboli this AM.
   -Will work up bacteremia as below
   -          Consider diureses today with IV lasix today, goal 2L
   negative
   # Endocarditis.   High-grade MSSA.  Vegitations on Mitral Valve per
   TEE.
   - Repeat blood cultures daily
   - Continue gentamicin and cefazolin per ID
   - f/u ID recs
   - f/u ortho recs regarding spinal osteo
   # Neck pain/Paraesthesia:   Ortho consulted likely secondary to chronic
   degenerative C-spine disease.
   - Hold NSAIDs given ARF
   - Morphine and oxycodone PRN, if not well controlled, consider using
   PCA
   - Lidocaine patch to neck today
   - Monitor neuro exams
   # Hyponatremia:  Likely secondary to either SIADH in the setting of
   pain and pulmonary process or hypervolemic hyponatremia in the setting
   of CHF.
   -          Received fluid bolus yesterday and worsened, will volume
   restrict and diurese now
   #. Anemia:  Mildly microcytic and stable in the high 20s (baseline).
   Most recent ferritin was greater than assay making iron deficiency less
   likely. Chronic inflammation seems likely cause in this patient.
   - Follow daily hct
   # Acute renal failure. SCr up to 1.3 from baseline of 1.0. Has been
   taking NSAIDs. in past has received hemodyalysis for Cr [**5-1**].
   - Hold NSAIDs
   - Encourage PO
   - Check urine/serum 'lytes daily
   #. Hyperglycemia. BS elevated on prior admissions but not on therapy.
   - If persists, will start HISS
   #. Hypertension. Continue home dose metoprolol.
   #. GERD. Continue Prilosec.

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition:
","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is a 52-year-old male with a history of multiple methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections, now presenting with MSSA endocarditis and neck pain. The patient is currently in the ICU for management.

The patient's current medical conditions and potential complications include:
1. Hypoxia: The patient appears to be experiencing secondary hypoxia due to shunt physiology, most likely secondary to septic emboli from likely progressive endocarditis given the new evidence of septic emboli this morning. 
2. Endocarditis: The patient has high-grade MSSA endocarditis with vegetations on the mitral valve as per transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Daily blood cultures are recommended, and the patient should continue with gentamicin and cefazolin per Infectious Disease (ID) recommendations. Follow-up with ID and orthopedic consultations is advised regarding spinal osteo.
3. Neck pain/Paraesthesia: The patient has neck pain and paraesthesia, which is likely secondary to chronic degenerative cervical spine disease. NSAIDs should be held due to acute renal failure (ARF), and alternative pain management options such as morphine and oxycodone on a PRN basis or patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) should be considered. A lidocaine patch to the neck today and monitoring of neuro exams are recommended.
