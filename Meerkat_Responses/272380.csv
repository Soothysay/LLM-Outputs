 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, hypothyroidism, compression fx c/b
   polymicrobial hardware related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent
   admission for pneumonia p/w dyspnea and cough with ground glass opacity
   and increased pleural effusion on CT chest.
   Dyspnea/Cough:  Most likely etiology is pneumonia given findings of
   ground glass on CT scan.  Influenza pending.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Attempting to obtain sputum sample.  Blood and urine
   cultures pending with no growth to date.  Likely exacerbated by large
   pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  Has not undergone
   thoracentesis.  CTA is negative for pulmonary embolism.  Now ruled out
   for MI (although mildly elevated troponins and flat CKs).
   - Vanco, zosyn, and levofloxacin for empiric coverage of HCAP
   - inpatient ID consult today
   - echocardiogram on [**2112-6-21**] with preserved ejection fraction although
   BNP elevated
   - follow urine, blood and sputum culture
   - diagnostic thoracentesis this morning
   - will check ABG this morning to assess for hypercarbia
   Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology. No h/o CHF with unremarkable TTE on
   [**6-21**] although was noted to be fluid overloaded on last admission in
   setting of aggressive IV fluids and BNP elevated at 6239 (no prior for
   comparison). Does have anasarca with low albumin (2 on [**5-23**]). H/o
   hypothyroidism with TSH 14 when checked [**6-23**]. No h/o malignancy.
   - TSH mildly elevated, T4 pending
   - Albumin low at 2.5
   - Thoracentesis in AM
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of lower running BP
   # Hypotension: Episode of hypotension in ED responsive to IV fluids.
   Concern for sepsis given leukocytosis and sx suggestive of respiratory
   tract infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have been volume down with possible decreased po
   intake in setting of acute illness, lactate mildly elevated at 2.1. No
   evidence of active bleed; Hct significantly above baseline but may
   represent hemoconcentration.  Patient received dobutamine overnight
   with stable blood pressures.
   - Broad abx as above
   - Hold outpt metoprolol and diuresis for now
   - Small fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP >55
   - Recheck lactate
   - d/c dobutamine as  unlikely his hypotension is caused by systolic
   heart failure.  If blood pressures decreased would opt for peripheral
   dopamine and likely would need central line placement
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis to 15 two weeks ago in setting of
   polymicrobial osteo but now increased to 30 with left shift at OSH,
   likely [**2-8**] new resp infection. No change in bowel habits to suggest C.
   diff although at risk given multiple recent abx regimens. U/A
   nonspecific for infection. No mention in notes of recent steroids.
   Inflammatory markers actually decreased since mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Broad abx as above
   - Sputum and blood cx as above, influenza DFA
   - Check C. diff
   - F/u urine cx
   - Check ESR/CRP for monitoring of osteomyelitis
   - F/u cx data from [**Hospital **] Rehab and [**Hospital1 1504**] if available
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Inpatient ID consult in AM as followed as outpatient for
   osteomyelitis
   - will consider PICC placement today for IV antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Likely in setting of acute illness and lower
   running BP. TSH elevated on [**2112-6-23**]. Given spine instrumention, CNS
   infection possible but lower on differential given recent negative
   imaging and broad treatment. No focal findings on limited neuro exam.
   - Monitor neuro status
   - Hold outpt neurontin, remeron for now
   - Keep NPO with nutrition via tube feeds
   - Manage hypotension as above
   # Osteomyelitis: In setting of spine instrumentation/hardware. Swabs
   grew out rare bacteroides fragilis ( beta-lactamase positive) on [**5-5**]
   and  E. coli and Klebsiella Oxytoca on [**5-6**]. Swab and bone tissue
   culture on [**5-10**] grew out E. coli and B. fragilis. Treated with course of
   meropenem/ertapenem, completed [**7-4**] and switched to suppressive therapy
   with cefpodoxime and augmentin.  Inflammatory markers decreasing since
   mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Hold cefpodoxime and augmentin given broad abx coverage as above
   - ID consult in AM for abx recs
   - Hold outpt neurontin for now given AMS, tylenol prn for pain
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 14 on [**2112-6-23**], now 6.4.
   - Add on T4
   - Cont home levothyroxine for now
   .
   # ?ECG changes: H/o CAD s/p CABG [**23**] years ago. Per son, not having
   chest pain but only chest wall soreness [**2-8**] increased work of
   breathing.  Reported new TWI at [**Hospital **] Rehab (ECG not available) but
   baseline at [**Hospital1 1504**] and here. Mildly elevated trop with nl CK likely
   reflects demand v. renal failure.  Troponins slightly elevated but not
   increasing with flat CKs and MBs.
   - Obtain ECG from [**Hospital **] Rehab
   - Monitor on tele
   - echocardiogram this morning
   .

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia presenting with dyspnea and cough. The patient has impaired skin integrity, hypotension (not shock), and dyspnea (shortness of breath). There are also indications of renal failure, altered mental status, and osteomyelitis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough and dyspnea, along with ground glass opacity on CT chest, suggest a possible pneumonia. Influenza DFA is pending, and blood and urine cultures are also pending. The patient is being treated empirically with vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and levofloxacin.
2. Pleural effusion: The patient has a moderate-sized left pleural effusion, which may be slightly increased in size compared to prior. This could potentially lead to respiratory compromise and may require diagnostic thoracentesis.
3. Hypotension: The patient experienced an episode of hypotension in the emergency department that responded to IV fluids. The patient is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics and small fluid boluses are being given to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >55. Dobutamine was used overnight but is being discontinued as it is unlikely that the patient's hypotension is caused by systolic heart failure.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient has leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 30, indicating a possible new respiratory infection. Blood and sputum cultures are pending.
5. Chronic renal failure: The patient has chronic renal failure with a baseline creatinine level of 1.3. Renal function should be closely monitored.
6. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of spine instrumentation and hardware-related osteomyelitis. Inflammatory markers are decreasing since mid-month, suggesting a response to treatment.
7. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is elevated, indicating hypothyroidism. Thyroxine supplementation may be necessary.
8. Possible ECG changes: The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and previous CABG surgery. There are concerns about possible ECG changes, including new TWI at another rehab facility. An ECG from that facility is requested.
9. Anasarca: The patient has generalized edema (anasarca) with low albumin levels, which could be related to chronic renal failure or hypothyroidism.
10. Compression fracture: The patient has a history of compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis."

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, compression fracture of the spine, polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia. He presented with hypotension and sepsis, which has been managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has been weaned off dopamine but is still on minimal doses of antihypertensives. There are concerns about possible sources of infection, including pneumonia, infected pleural effusion, Clostridium difficile (C. diff), and fungemia. 

Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's baseline blood pressure is usually in the 110s and he is on antihypertensives. He is currently on minimal dopamine and his lactate levels have normalized. The patient is afebrile and leukocytosis is improving on broad antibiotics. The possible sources of infection include pneumonia vs. infected pleural effusion (cough, infiltrates), C. diff (negative once), and question of fungemia (heavy antibiotic exposure, oral thrush), less likely spine (recent stable MRI findings).
2. Pleural Effusion: The etiology of the pleural effusion is unclear. It could be due to grade I diastolic heart failure with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 6239, parapneumonic effusion, or anasarca with low albumin levels. Thoracentesis has been recommended.
3. Osteomyelitis: The patient has hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis. Swabs and bone tissue cultures have grown out rare Bacteroides fragilis and E. coli. The patient has completed a course of meropenem/ertapenem and switched to suppressive therapy with cefpodoxime and augmentin. However, broad antibiotic coverage has been initiated as per ID recommendations.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely due to acute illness and lower running blood pressure. He appears back to baseline.
5. Hypothyroidism: The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was previously elevated at 14 on [**2112-6-23**], but it has now decreased to 6.4 with a T4 level of 4.4. Levothyroxine should be continued, and further follow-up is required.
6. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): The patient has a history of CAD and underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) 23 years ago. He reported new total white inferior (TWI) at [**Hospital**] rehab, but his baseline ECG at [**Hospital1 1504**] and current ECG do not show any signs of myocardial infarction (MI). Mildly elevated troponins are likely representing demand ischemia, now trending downward.
7. Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level is at baseline at 1"

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia presenting with dyspnea and cough. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension/sepsis and is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The patient has multiple medical complications including pleural effusion, osteomyelitis, altered mental status, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and cough, along with leukocytosis and ground glass on imaging, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. Further evaluation with sputum culture is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
2. Pleural Effusion: The patient has an unclear etiology of pleural effusion, which may be due to parapneumonic effusion, cardiac dysfunction, or other causes. Thoracentesis is recommended to determine the cause and guide treatment.
3. Osteomyelitis: The patient has a history of spine instrumentation/hardware and has grown bacteroides fragilis and E. coli from swab and bone tissue culture. Despite previous treatment with meropenem/ertapenem and switching to suppressive therapy with cefpodoxime and augmentin, ongoing monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR Portable [**2112-7-7**]: AP single view of the chest was obtained with
   patient in sitting

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, hypothyroidism, compression fx c/b
   polymicrobial hardware related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent
   admission for pneumonia p/w dyspnea and cough with ground glass opacity
   and increased pleural effusion on CT chest.
   Dyspnea/Cough:  Most likely etiology is pneumonia given findings of
   ground glass on CT scan.  Influenza pending.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Attempting to obtain sputum sample.  Blood and urine
   cultures pending with no growth to date.  Likely exacerbated by large
   pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  Has not undergone
   thoracentesis.  CTA is negative for pulmonary embolism.  Now ruled out
   for MI (although mildly elevated troponins and flat CKs).
   - Vanco, zosyn, and levofloxacin for empiric coverage of HCAP
   - inpatient ID consult today
   - echocardiogram on [**2112-6-21**] with preserved ejection fraction although
   BNP elevated
   - follow urine, blood and sputum culture
   - diagnostic thoracentesis this morning
   - will check ABG this morning to assess for hypercarbia
   Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology. No h/o CHF with unremarkable TTE on
   [**6-21**] although was noted to be fluid overloaded on last admission in
   setting of aggressive IV fluids and BNP elevated at 6239 (no prior for
   comparison). Does have anasarca with low albumin (2 on [**5-23**]). H/o
   hypothyroidism with TSH 14 when checked [**6-23**]. No h/o malignancy.
   - TSH mildly elevated, T4 pending
   - Albumin low at 2.5
   - Thoracentesis in AM
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of lower running BP
   # Hypotension: Episode of hypotension in ED responsive to IV fluids.
   Concern for sepsis given leukocytosis and sx suggestive of respiratory
   tract infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have been volume down with possible decreased po
   intake in setting of acute illness, lactate mildly elevated at 2.1. No
   evidence of active bleed; Hct significantly above baseline but may
   represent hemoconcentration.  Patient received dobutamine overnight
   with stable blood pressures.
   - Broad abx as above
   - Hold outpt metoprolol and diuresis for now
   - Small fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP >55
   - Recheck lactate
   - d/c dobutamine as  unlikely his hypotension is caused by systolic
   heart failure.  If blood pressures decreased would opt for peripheral
   dopamine and likely would need central line placement
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis to 15 two weeks ago in setting of
   polymicrobial osteo but now increased to 30 with left shift at OSH,
   likely [**2-8**] new resp infection. No change in bowel habits to suggest C.
   diff although at risk given multiple recent abx regimens. U/A
   nonspecific for infection. No mention in notes of recent steroids.
   Inflammatory markers actually decreased since mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Broad abx as above
   - Sputum and blood cx as above, influenza DFA
   - Check C. diff
   - F/u urine cx
   - Check ESR/CRP for monitoring of osteomyelitis
   - F/u cx data from [**Hospital **] Rehab and [**Hospital1 1504**] if available
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Inpatient ID consult in AM as followed as outpatient for
   osteomyelitis
   - will consider PICC placement today for IV antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Likely in setting of acute illness and lower
   running BP. TSH elevated on [**2112-6-23**]. Given spine instrumention, CNS
   infection possible but lower on differential given recent negative
   imaging and broad treatment. No focal findings on limited neuro exam.
   - Monitor neuro status
   - Hold outpt neurontin, remeron for now
   - Keep NPO with nutrition via tube feeds
   - Manage hypotension as above
   # Osteomyelitis: In setting of spine instrumentation/hardware. Swabs
   grew out rare bacteroides fragilis ( beta-lactamase positive) on [**5-5**]
   and  E. coli and Klebsiella Oxytoca on [**5-6**]. Swab and bone tissue
   culture on [**5-10**] grew out E. coli and B. fragilis. Treated with course of
   meropenem/ertapenem, completed [**7-4**] and switched to suppressive therapy
   with cefpodoxime and augmentin.  Inflammatory markers decreasing since
   mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Hold cefpodoxime and augmentin given broad abx coverage as above
   - ID consult in AM for abx recs
   - Hold outpt neurontin for now given AMS, tylenol prn for pain
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 14 on [**2112-6-23**], now 6.4.
   - Add on T4
   - Cont home levothyroxine for now
   .
   # ?ECG changes: H/o CAD s/p CABG [**23**] years ago. Per son, not having
   chest pain but only chest wall soreness [**2-8**] increased work of
   breathing.  Reported new TWI at [**Hospital **] Rehab (ECG not available) but
   baseline at [**Hospital1 1504**] and here. Mildly elevated trop with nl CK likely
   reflects demand v. renal failure.  Troponins slightly elevated but not
   increasing with flat CKs and MBs.
   - Obtain ECG from [**Hospital **] Rehab
   - Monitor on tele
   - echocardiogram this morning
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Currently at baseline Cr 1.3 (since admission
   for spine fracture)

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia presenting with dyspnea and cough. The patient has impaired skin integrity, hypotension, dyspnea, and chronic renal failure. He is currently in the ICU receiving mechanical ventilation and has been diagnosed with pneumonia, osteomyelitis, hypothyroidism, and chronic kidney disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Complications: Given the patient's history of pneumonia and current presence in the ICU, there is a potential for respiratory complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
2. Infection: The patient has a high risk of developing infections due to his compromised immune system, prolonged hospital stay, and invasive medical devices such as central lines and urinary catheters. Infections could include ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-related bloodstream infection, or urinary tract infection.
3. Cardiovascular Complications: The patient's history of coronary artery disease and recent cardiac events put him at risk for cardiovascular complications such as myocardial infarction or arrhythmias.
4. Renal Failure: The patient's pre-existing chronic renal failure may worsen during his ICU stay due to factors such as medications, infections, or sepsis.
5. Thromboembolic Events: Immobility and the presence of central lines increase"

   Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global
   systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Transmitral Doppler and
   tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade I (mild) LV diastolic
   dysfunction. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
   normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The
   aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is
   not present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
   leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
   Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery
   systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
   CXR Portable [**2112-7-7**]: AP single view of the chest was obtained with
   patient in sitting
   upright position. Available for comparison is a preceding similar study
   of [**2112-7-6**]. Findings include status post sternotomy and bypass
   surgery,
   calcified walls in the thoracic aorta and moderate cardiomegaly.
   Bibasilar
   atelectases remain unchanged. Apical lung areas are unaltered and no
   evidence of pneumothorax on either side.

 IMPAIRED SKIN INTEGRITY
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH)
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE)
   A/P: [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, hypothyroidism, compression fx c/b
   polymicrobial hardware related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent
   admission for pneumonia p/w dyspnea and cough with ground glass opacity
   and increased pleural effusion on CT chest.
   Dyspnea/Cough:  Most likely etiology is pneumonia given findings of
   ground glass on CT scan.  Influenza pending.  Urine legionella
   negative.  Attempting to obtain sputum sample.  Blood and urine
   cultures pending with no growth to date.  Likely exacerbated by large
   pleural effusion with compressive atelectasis.  Has not undergone
   thoracentesis.  CTA is negative for pulmonary embolism.  Now ruled out
   for MI (although mildly elevated troponins and flat CKs).
   - Vanco, zosyn, and levofloxacin for empiric coverage of HCAP
   - inpatient ID consult today
   - echocardiogram on [**2112-6-21**] with preserved ejection fraction although
   BNP elevated
   - follow urine, blood and sputum culture
   - diagnostic thoracentesis this morning
   - will check ABG this morning to assess for hypercarbia
   Pleural effusion: Unclear etiology. No h/o CHF with unremarkable TTE on
   [**6-21**] although was noted to be fluid overloaded on last admission in
   setting of aggressive IV fluids and BNP elevated at 6239 (no prior for
   comparison). Does have anasarca with low albumin (2 on [**5-23**]). H/o
   hypothyroidism with TSH 14 when checked [**6-23**]. No h/o malignancy.
   - TSH mildly elevated, T4 pending
   - Albumin low at 2.5
   - Thoracentesis in AM
   - Hold diuresis for now in setting of lower running BP
   # Hypotension: Episode of hypotension in ED responsive to IV fluids.
   Concern for sepsis given leukocytosis and sx suggestive of respiratory
   tract infection. [**Month (only) 11**] have been volume down with possible decreased po
   intake in setting of acute illness, lactate mildly elevated at 2.1. No
   evidence of active bleed; Hct significantly above baseline but may
   represent hemoconcentration.  Patient received dobutamine overnight
   with stable blood pressures.
   - Broad abx as above
   - Hold outpt metoprolol and diuresis for now
   - Small fluid boluses as needed to maintain MAP >55
   - Recheck lactate
   - d/c dobutamine as  unlikely his hypotension is caused by systolic
   heart failure.  If blood pressures decreased would opt for peripheral
   dopamine and likely would need central line placement
   # Leukocytosis: Leukocytosis to 15 two weeks ago in setting of
   polymicrobial osteo but now increased to 30 with left shift at OSH,
   likely [**2-8**] new resp infection. No change in bowel habits to suggest C.
   diff although at risk given multiple recent abx regimens. U/A
   nonspecific for infection. No mention in notes of recent steroids.
   Inflammatory markers actually decreased since mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Broad abx as above
   - Sputum and blood cx as above, influenza DFA
   - Check C. diff
   - F/u urine cx
   - Check ESR/CRP for monitoring of osteomyelitis
   - F/u cx data from [**Hospital **] Rehab and [**Hospital1 1504**] if available
   - Trend fever curve and WBC
   - Inpatient ID consult in AM as followed as outpatient for
   osteomyelitis
   - will consider PICC placement today for IV antibiotics
   # Altered mental status: Likely in setting of acute illness and lower
   running BP. TSH elevated on [**2112-6-23**]. Given spine instrumention, CNS
   infection possible but lower on differential given recent negative
   imaging and broad treatment. No focal findings on limited neuro exam.
   - Monitor neuro status
   - Hold outpt neurontin, remeron for now
   - Keep NPO with nutrition via tube feeds
   - Manage hypotension as above
   # Osteomyelitis: In setting of spine instrumentation/hardware. Swabs
   grew out rare bacteroides fragilis ( beta-lactamase positive) on [**5-5**]
   and  E. coli and Klebsiella Oxytoca on [**5-6**]. Swab and bone tissue
   culture on [**5-10**] grew out E. coli and B. fragilis. Treated with course of
   meropenem/ertapenem, completed [**7-4**] and switched to suppressive therapy
   with cefpodoxime and augmentin.  Inflammatory markers decreasing since
   mid [**Month (only) **].
   - Hold cefpodoxime and augmentin given broad abx coverage as above
   - ID consult in AM for abx recs
   - Hold outpt neurontin for now given AMS, tylenol prn for pain
   # Hypothyroidism: TSH 14 on [**2112-6-23**], now 6.4.
   - Add on T4
   - Cont home levothyroxine for now
   .
   # ?ECG changes: H/o CAD s/p CABG [**23**] years ago. Per son, not having
   chest pain but only chest wall soreness [**2-8**] increased work of
   breathing.  Reported new TWI at [**Hospital **] Rehab (ECG not available) but
   baseline at [**Hospital1 1504**] and here. Mildly elevated trop with nl CK likely
   reflects demand v. renal failure.  Troponins slightly elevated but not
   increasing with flat CKs and MBs.
   - Obtain ECG from [**Hospital **] Rehab
   - Monitor on tele
   - echocardiogram this morning
   .
   # Chronic renal failure: Currently at baseline Cr 1.3 (since admission
   for spine fracture)

","Summary:
The patient is a 90-year-old male with a history of CAD, hypothyroidism, compression fracture, polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia. He presents with dyspnea, cough, hypotension, leukocytosis, altered mental status, osteomyelitis, hypothyroidism, and chronic renal failure. He is currently admitted to the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Impaired skin integrity: The patient may be at risk for pressure ulcers due to prolonged bed rest.
2. Hypotension: The patient has had episodes of hypotension, which may be due to sepsis or heart failure. Monitoring and appropriate management are essential to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Dyspnea: The patient's respiratory distress could be attributed to pneumonia, pleural effusion, or other underlying conditions. Oxygen therapy and further diagnostic investigations, such as a chest X-ray or thoracentesis, may be necessary.
4. Leukocytosis: The patient's high white blood cell count suggests an infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been initiated, and cultures are pending for confirmation. Close monitoring of inflammatory markers is also important.
5. Altered mental status: The patient's confusion may be related to acute illness, hypothyroidism, or other factors. Neurological examination and appropriate management, including maintaining adequate blood pressure and fluid balance, are crucial.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, and compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and is currently experiencing dyspnea and cough. The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia, and there is a possibility of fungemia and pleural effusion. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is showing improvement. The patient also has altered mental status, which is likely due to acute illness and hypotension. He has a history of chronic renal failure and is currently on dialysis. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is being closely monitored in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has symptoms of pneumonia, such as dyspnea and cough, along with leukocytosis and ground glass opacities on imaging. If not adequately treated, pneumonia can progress to respiratory failure.
2. Sepsis: The patient has been diagnosed with sepsis, which is a life-threatening condition caused by a systemic infection. If not properly managed, sepsis can lead to organ dysfunction and failure.
3. Fungemia: The patient's heavy antibiotic exposure and oral thrush raise concerns for possible fungemia. If left untreated, fungemia can lead to disseminated infection and septicemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly male with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, and a compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis. He was admitted recently for pneumonia and is currently experiencing dyspnea and cough. The patient's current condition includes hypotension, sepsis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, and altered mental status. He is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia and is scheduled for further diagnostic tests. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but his blood pressure remains low. He is receiving ICU care, including nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis and stress ulcers. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient is already showing signs of sepsis, which can progress to severe sepsis or septic shock if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has leukocytosis and ground glass opacities on imaging, indicating pneumonia. If left untreated, it may worsen and lead to respiratory failure.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient has a pleural effusion, which can potentially lead to respiratory compromise if not addressed.
4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status should be closely monitored, as it could be a sign of worsening sepsis"

","Summary:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), hypothyroidism, and a compression fracture caused by polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis. He was recently admitted for pneumonia and is now presenting with dyspnea and cough. He is currently in the ICU for hypotension and sepsis, with an unclear source of infection. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics per ID consult. His current vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, blood pressure of 111/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on nasal cannula.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's hypotension and presence of infection indicators (leukocytosis) suggest the possibility of sepsis. It is important to closely monitor his vital signs and respond promptly to any signs of deterioration.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and cough, along with leukocytosis and ground glass opacities on imaging, suggest pneumonia. Appropriate antibiotics should be continued, and further diagnostic tests like sputum cultures may be necessary.
3. Pleural Effusion: The patient's altered mental status and pleural effusion may be secondary to increased total body volume. Diagnostic procedures such as thoracentesis or chest X-ray may help in identifying the underlying cause"

   [**Age over 90 **] yo man with h/o CAD, hypothyroidism, compression fx c/b
   polymicrobial hardware related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent
   admission for pneumonia p/w dyspnea/cough.
   Hypotension/sepsis: Off dopamine.  Source of sepsis unclear.  On broad
   antibiotics per ID.
   - Appreciate ID consult
   - Diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**] today
   - F/u KUB read and consider abd/pelvis CT scan
   - F/U cultures
   Dyspnea/Cough:  Leukocytosis and ground glass suggestive of pneumonia
   although CHF also on differential given diastolic dysfunction on TTE.
   Effusion with atelectasis also contributing.  No PE on CTA
   - Abx as above for HAP
   - Diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**] today
   - Diuresis when BP stable off pressors
   Pleural effusion: Likely secondary to increased total body volume
   - Diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**] today
   Altered mental status: Back to baseline.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an elderly male with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypothyroidism, compression fracture due to polymicrobial hardware-related vertebral osteomyelitis, and recent admission for pneumonia. The patient presents with symptoms of dyspnea and cough. The assessment and plan indicate several potential medical complications:

1. Hypotension/Sepsis: The patient's hypotension may be due to sepsis, but the source of sepsis is unclear. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics as recommended by the infectious disease (ID) consultant.

2. Dyspnea/Cough: The patient's dyspnea and cough could be attributed to pneumonia, although congestive heart failure (CHF) is also a differential diagnosis considering the diastolic dysfunction observed during the transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Effusion with atelectasis may also contribute to these symptoms. The treatment plan includes continuing antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), conducting diagnostic tests, and considering diuresis when the patient's blood pressure is stable off pressors.

3. Pleural Effusion: The patient likely has a pleural effusion secondary to increased total body volume. Diagnostic tests are planned for today.

4. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status has returned to baseline.

5. Pleural Effusion: This complication is likely due to increased total body volume.

6. Potential Complications: The patient"
