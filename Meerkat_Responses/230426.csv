","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old man with a recent traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension which have been constant since his admission to the hospital.

The patient has been treated for suspected hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem due to new findings on CT and CXR showing bilateral lower lobe opacities, along with sputum gram stain results indicating gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and gram-negative rods (GNRs). The plan is to tailor antibiotics once culture results are available.

The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypertension have been evaluated during his last admission, and the differential diagnosis included pneumonia, meningitis/abscess, pancreatitis, Clostridium difficile infection, drug fevers, and central fevers from head trauma. Tachycardia and hypertension could either be a response to fever/infection or symptoms of traumatic brain injury.

Other medical conditions and plans include:
- Right femoral central venous line placed in the emergency department.
- Treatment for diffuse exonal injury, with amantadine and skeletal muscle relaxation.
- Peg tube in place for enteral feeding, restarting tube feeds today with nutrition consultation for recommendations.
- Lovenox for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis.
- Prophylactic proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for stress ulcer prevention.
- Head of bed elevation for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention.
- Code status: full code.
- Disposition: ICU care for now, may be able to transfer back to rehab facility directly from the ICU when more stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, tachycardia, and new findings on CT and CXR, suggest the possibility of pneumonia. This condition can be further complicated by the presence of bilateral lower lobe opacities and the presence of GPCs and GNRs in the sputum gram stain.
2. Meningitis/abscess: The patient's fever and altered mental status raise concerns about meningitis or abscess formation, especially given the history of head trauma.
3. Pancreatitis: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, and hypertension could potentially be related to pancreatitis.
4. Clostridium difficile infection: The patient's fever and recent antibiotic use raise the possibility of Clostridium difficile infection.
5. Drug fevers: The patient's fever could be a drug-related adverse reaction.
6. Autonomic dysfunction: The patient's symptoms of tachycardia, diaphoresis, and tachypnea may be manifestations of autonomic dysfunction secondary to traumatic brain injury.
7. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis due to his immobility and risk factors for clot formation.

It is important to closely monitor the patient"

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 22-year-old male with recent traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension, which have been constant since his admission to the hospital. The patient's fevers, tachycardia, hypertension, and poor mental and neurological status have been present for several weeks. A CT scan of the chest reveals new findings of bilateral lower lobe opacities, and a sputum gram stain shows Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and Gram-negative rods (GNRs).

The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem, and the antibiotics will be tailored based on culture results. Other medications include metoprolol, morphine sulfate, and inhalers as needed. The patient will continue to have a tracheostomy collar with supplemental oxygen as needed.

The patient also has a right femoral central venous line (CVL) placed in the emergency department, and efforts will be made to place peripheral IVs and discontinue the line as soon as possible. The patient's code status is full code, and his disposition is currently ICU care, with a potential transfer back to the rehabilitation facility directly from the ICU when more stable.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury and cervical spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension. The patient's symptoms have been constant since admission to the hospital and during his stay at the rehabilitation center. A recent CT scan shows bilateral lower lobe opacities, and a sputum gram stain indicates the presence of GPCs and GNRs.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is being treated for healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem. Antibiotic therapy will be tailored based on culture results. Levofloxacin will be discontinued. The patient's tracheostomy collar will remain in place for two months as recommended by neurosurgery.

Other issues addressed in the plan include fever, tachycardia, and hypertension, which could be related to infection or symptoms of traumatic brain injury. Propranolol dosage has been increased to better control heart rate. Morphine will be given as needed for discomfort. The patient's right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will be managed with lovenox. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on CT angiography (CTA). The patient's feeding tube will be restarted with nutrition consultation recommendations. A PICC line consultation has been scheduled to discontinue the right femoral central venous"

","Summary:
The patient is a 22-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury and cervical spine fracture following a motor vehicle accident. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension, which have been constant since admission. The patient also has a tracheostomy collar and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate levels. Imaging reveals new bilateral lower lobe opacities on chest CT scan. The patient has been treated with various antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem, and is also receiving enoxaparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. The patient's mental and neurological status are poor, with agitation and posturing observed during the examination.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The presence of new bilateral lower lobe opacities on chest CT scan, along with fever and elevated white blood cell count, suggests the possibility of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). The patient is already being treated with appropriate antibiotics for HAP.
2. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobilization and has been receiving prophylactic enoxaparin. However, the mention of ""RUE DVT"" indicates a possible existing DVT in the right upper extremity.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old male with a recent traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension since admission to the hospital. He has been experiencing these symptoms for several weeks. A CT scan shows bilateral lower lobe opacities, and a sputum gram stain indicates the presence of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods. The patient's fevers, tachycardia, hypertension, and poor mental and neurological status have been ongoing since admission. The patient has been readmitted to the ICU due to pneumonia, as evidenced by new findings on the CT scan compared to the previous one. The patient is being treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia with vancomycin and meropenem. Cultures are being followed, and medications will be tailored based on the results.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with pneumonia, which is a lung infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, it can lead to worsening respiratory symptoms, sepsis, and even death.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's tracheostomy collar and prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. This type of infection occurs in patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. If not prevented or treated promptly,"

   22 y/o man with recent traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture
   following MVC in [**9-17**] who presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis,
   tachypnea, fever and hypertension which appear to have been constant
   since his admission to [**Hospital1 19**] on [**2100-9-18**] and through discharge and stay
   at [**Hospital 1888**] rehab, thought to be likely central fever and autonomic
   instability, but now with CT showing bilateraly LL opacities and sputum
   gram stain with GPCs and GNdiplococci.
   .
   # Pneumonia: CT and CXR today read as having new findings compared to
   previous, but pt's fevers, tachycardia, hypertension, and poor mental
   and neurological status have been present for several weeks.  Fever was
   higher on admission and has resolved somewhat with abx. However, given
   culture prelim data, elevated WBC count today, and imaging results,
   will treat for HAP with vancomycin and meropenem. Compared to prior CT
   scan of chest, infiltrates in bilateral lower lobes are new. There is
   no evidence of pulmonary emboli on CTA. Plan to tailor antibiotics once
   cultures return. ABG reassuring (not alkalemic from hyperventilation).
   - continue Vanc/[**Last Name (un) **] to complete 8 day course for HAP
   - will d/c levofloxacin
   - follow sputum culture and blood/urine cultures, alter medications as
   appropriate
   - inhalers prn
   - continue trach collar for 2 months per neurosurg recs.
   - WBC count improving, now down to 7.3
   # Fever/Tachicardia/HTN: evaluated during last admission by ID [**2100-10-4**],
   differential for fever included PNA, meningitis/abcess [**3-13**] previous ICP
   monitor, pancreatitis, C.diff, drug fevers and central fevers from head
   trauma. Tachicadia/HTN could either be response to fever/infection, or
   all could be symptoms of traumatic brain injury.  A case study in  Arch
   Phys Med Rehabil. [**2086**] [**Month (only) **];75(7):816-8, reports 3 patients w/ TBI all
   of which ""had decorticate posturing and symptoms of autonomic
   dysfunction, manifested by tachycardia and profuse sweating. Each of
   these patients developed high fevers ranging from 38.9 degrees C to
   40.6 degrees C"" Fevers in these patients were reduced with Propanolol.
   -          no lasting response of HR to IVF boluses
   -          increase propanolol to 40mg to q8h dosing to attempt better
   HR control and treat central fever
   -          Transition pain control from morphine to Oxycodone
   -          can resume prn roxicodone (usual outpatient regimen) to be
   used prior to morphine
   # RUE DVT: continue lovenox [**Hospital1 7**] dosing.
   - Consider repeat US before d/c to rehab or home to see if UE DVT has
   resolved, if not, should likely transition to coumadin.
   .
   # Diffuse exonal injury: appears that there is no sig change from prior
   admission. Discuss appropriate f/u with family.
   -          amantadine & skelaxin for rigidity
   -          neurosurgery aware that he has been readmitted
   -  discuss with Neurology and consider transfer from MICU to neurology
   floor.
   .
   # FEN: NPO, peg in place, restarted tube feeds with nutrition
   consultation for recommendations, lyte repletion prn
   - some pressure damage at site of PEG tube, should have a circular
   support.  Contact surgeon who placed.
   - Tube feeds held for PICC placement by IR, will restart following.

   #ACCESS: Will do PICC line today in IR with goal to d/c right femoral
   CVL ASAP.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 22-year-old male with a history of traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension, which have been constant since admission. The patient also has a recent CT scan showing bilateral lower lobe opacities and sputum gram stain with GPCs and GNdiplococci.

Assessment and plan:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's fevers, tachycardia, hypertension, and poor mental and neurological status have been present for several weeks. A new finding on the CT scan indicates infiltrates in the bilateral lower lobes, suggesting pneumonia. The patient will be treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem. Antibiotics will be tailored once cultures return.
2. Fever/Tachycardia/HTN: The patient's symptoms may be due to pneumonia or central fever from head trauma. Propanolol will be increased to better control the heart rate and treat central fever.
3. RUE DVT: The patient has a right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Enoxaparin (Lovenox) will be continued, and a repeat ultrasound will be done before discharge to assess if the DVT has resolved. If not, the patient may transition to coumad"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 22-year-old man with a history of traumatic brain injury and C-spine fracture following a motor vehicle collision. He presents with tachycardia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, fever, and hypertension, which have been constant since his admission to the hospital. His condition has been persistent for several weeks. A recent CT scan shows bilateral lower lobe opacities, and a sputum gram stain indicates the presence of Gram-positive cocci (GPCs) and Gram-negative rods (GNRs). The patient's fever was higher on admission but has resolved somewhat with antibiotic treatment. However, considering the culture preliminary data, elevated white blood cell count, and imaging results, the patient will be treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) with vancomycin and meropenem. The antibiotics will be tailored based on the culture results. The patient's ABG is reassuring, and there is no evidence of pulmonary embolism on the CT angiogram. The plan is to continue vancomycin until completing an 8-day course for HAP, discontinue levofloxacin, follow sputum and blood/urine cultures, and alter medications as appropriate. The patient will also continue using inhalers as needed and maintain the tracheostomy collar for two months per neurosurgical recommendations. The patient's fever, tachycardia, and hypertension were evaluated during the last admission by the infectious disease"
