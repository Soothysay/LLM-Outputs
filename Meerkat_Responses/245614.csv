   Assessment and Plan
 CHRONIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AFIB):  Off coumadin given guaiac
   positive stools, history of epistaxis, anemia.  Rate controlled.
 ANEMIA, SECONDARY TO BLOOD LOSS (HEMORRHAGE, BLEEDING):  Hct stable.
   No stools here albeit guaiac positive in ED. GI to evaluate to assess
   relative pros/[**Name2 (NI) **] to proceeding with procedure given underlying
   comorbidities.  Also to comment on need for CT abdomen to further
   evaluate ?pancreatic mass, elevated AP/lipase. Unable to give contrast
   given renal function.
 THROMBOCYTOPENIA, ACUTE DROP:  Has been on heparin, now holding.
   Review of drug list doesn't identify other agents that may be
   contributing.  Has had documented splenomegaly on US, may be component
   of sequestration.  Will follow for now.
 HEART FAILURE (CHF), DIASTOLIC, CHRONIC:  Currently more right sided
   failure than left sided CHF.  Lungs and CXR clear.  Likely
   intravascularly dry given poor po intake, would hold diuretics in
   setting of this and relative hypotension.  [**Name2 (NI) 9026**] with IVFs. Plan to
   keep I/Os even today.
 RENAL FAILURE, CHRONIC (CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE, CRF, CHRONIC KIDNEY
   DISEASE): Cr improved with gentle diuresis.  Fluid status as above.
 COAGULOPATHY:  Likely nutritional, agree with vitamin K.  Labs
   trending down.
   Agree with detailed assessment and plan as per [**Hospital **] medical resident's
   note.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, mild aortic stenosis, hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, anemia, and chronic renal insufficiency. He presented with relative hypotension and anemia. He has been admitted to the ICU and is currently critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Bleeding: The patient has guaiac positive stools, indicating gastrointestinal bleeding. This could be due to his anemia and history of hemorrhage. Further evaluation and management by the gastroenterology department is recommended.
2. Thrombocytopenia: The patient has a low platelet count, which may be caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). It is important to hold heparin and monitor the platelet count closely.
3. Heart Failure: The patient has chronic diastolic congestive heart failure, primarily affecting the right side of the heart. His poor oral intake and fluid status suggest that he may be intravascularly dry. Diuretics should be used cautiously due to his relative hypotension.
4. Renal Failure: The patient has chronic renal failure, as indicated by his elevated creatinine levels. Close monitoring of his renal function and fluid status is necessary.
5. Coagulopathy: The patient likely has a nutritional deficiency contributing to his coagulopathy. Vitamin K supplementation is recommended.

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with lethargy, hypotension, and anemia. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic renal failure. The patient's condition has been unstable, with persistent hypotension despite fluid boluses. The patient's blood pressure remains in the 70s systolic, and diuresis with lasix drip was recommended by cardiology but could not be initiated due to low blood pressure. A PICC line was placed due to concerns for the need for pressors. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 75 bpm, blood pressure of 109/88 mmHg (69), respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fever. The patient has allergies to quinidine and propranolol. The patient's lab results show anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, low platelet count of 79 K/uL, elevated creatinine level of 2.9 mg/dL, and slightly low potassium level of 3.0 mEq/L. The patient's chest X-ray shows cardiomegaly, no overt heart failure, a small left pleural effusion, and a dextroscoliosis of the T-spine. The patient"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known firstname 160**] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **]. [**Known lastname 14060**] is a very nice 87 year-old gentleman with HTN,
   diastolic CHF (EF 65% 1/10), AFib not on Coumadin, and mild AS, Stage
   IV CKD who comes with a ""drop"" in his HCT and elevated creatinine and
   weight.
   .
   #. Hypotension
 patient hypotensive yesterday several times to SBP
   70s, MAPS ~50 with HR in the 50s.  Given multiple fluid boluses with
   good response.  Lungs clear this am.  PICC placed for possible
   pressors. Given CHF both fluids and pressors not indicated, but as
   patient is full code, our only other option would be ionotropes.
   - hold antihypertensives
   - follow up cardiology recs
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure - Patient with EF of 65%
   gaining weight according to rehab (13 pounds), despite higher torsemide
   dose. He does not report any dietary changes and has been on ""no salt
   added"" diet. He takes his medications as prescribed and no signs of
   infections. No clear precipitant, however he is slowly gaining weight.
   Again, hypotensive as above.  Ideally we would like to keep him on his
   home BB and diurese him, but
   - IV Lasix 100 x1
   - Re-start Torsemide in AM
   - Daily standing weight
   - COntinue rate control for AFib
   .
   #. Anemia / GIB?
 Hct 23 on admission, up to 29 yesterday, now at 23,
   no blood given.  GI seen, ? EGD monday   vs. outpatient.
   - Check B12 & folate
   - Vitamin K
   - HCT [**Hospital1 **]
   - 2 peripheral IVs
   - T&S and crossmatch 1 unit
   - Pt may need outpatient [**Last Name (un) **]/EGD
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia - Pt has had multiple PLT counts in the 130-140
   range in various occasions. However, since the last admission they have
   been decreasing up to the point of 80,000 today. Furthermore, patient
   has been on heparin during all this time. I think the differential
   includes dilutional given gain in weight vs. ITP. His medication list
   looks benign, but is also in the differential. MDS should be considered
   as well. There are no clear signs of infection. HIT is a possibility,
   but not likely given pattern of up and downs in PLT count, lack of
   evidence of thrombosis and timing. This is a possibility that needs to
   be considered, but given very low pre-test probability we should not
   send HIT antibody or start anticogulation yet (specially in the setting
   of bleeding).
   - HIT antibody
   - Outpatient f/u with heme
   - Trend PLTs
   .
   #. Increased PTT and INR -
   - Vitmain K 5 mg PO x1
   .
   #. Increased AP and GGT with elevated lipase and an abnormality on
   ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass.
   - CT scan in AM
   .
   #. Chronic atrial fibrillation - Patient with CHADS2 of 2 who is on
   low-dose aspirin and had his coumadin recently stopped given GIB. He is
   rate-controlled with metoprolol. TSH 3.9 in [**2141-2-27**].
   - Continue home-dose metoprolol
   - Hold aspirin for now given possible GIB
   .
   #. Chronic renal failure - Patient with creatinine of 3 at his new
   baseline since [**2140-9-29**]. His eGFR by MDRD formula is 24 ml/min. He
   is on torsemide 60 mg PO BID for his chronic heart failure, which may
   be contributing to his increased creatinine, but imrpoving his overall
   status. It is recommend to check PTH every 3 months with target of
   70-110.
   - Trend creatinine
   - Consider EPO as outpatient (target HGB [**7-7**])
   - PTH in AM
   - Ca & Phos
   - PO vitamin D
   .
   #. Hypertension - Pt on metoprolol at home for AFib and HTN.
   - Continue metoprolol for AFIb
   .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - his las lipid profile included LDL 62, HDL
   85, Chol 156 and TG of 43 in [**2139-9-30**].
   - Continue simvastatin
   - Check lipids in AM
   .
   #. Vitamin D deficiency - pt with VD of 17. He is currently on
   maintainance therapy.
   - Cont VD given improvement of ICU outcomes (among other things)
   #. FEN - Regular diet.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), mild aortic stenosis (AS), and stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD). He was admitted with lethargy and hypotension, and diagnosed with anemia and potential gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The patient's condition has been unstable with fluctuating vital signs, including hypotension and low blood pressure requiring fluid boluses and consideration of pressors. He also has thrombocytopenia, increased PTT and INR, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormalities on imaging suggestive of a pancreatic mass.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation indicates potential inadequate tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's weight gain and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels suggest worsening diastolic heart failure.
3. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's anemia and low hemoglobin levels may indicate ongoing or recent bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The significant decrease in platelet count raises concerns for possible platelet consumption or destruction, which can be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia"

   patient has end stage heart failure, and his prognosis has been
   discussed with him, his wife and daughter many times.  On prior
   admissions, it was understood that there would be no more escalations
   of care, as medical therapy for his heart failure had been maximized.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8762**] discussed goals of care with patient, wife and daughter
   yesterday.  [**Name2 (NI) 133**] likely need to have frequent family meetings to
   reinforce the prognosis of his heart failurem and the limited treatment
   options available.  For now patient is full code.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation (AFib), mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent weight gain. He presented with lethargy, hypotension, and anemia. The patient has been receiving fluids and pressors for hypotension, but his blood pressure remains low. He also has thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal pancreatic enzymes with a suspected pancreatic mass. The patient is currently on full code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and pressor support indicates a potential risk of organ hypoperfusion and failure.
2. Anemia/Gastrointestinal Bleeding (GIB): The patient's fluctuating hemoglobin levels and the presence of anemia suggest possible ongoing blood loss, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding. Further evaluation and management are needed to identify and treat any underlying causes.
3. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding complications. Close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent hemorrhagic events.
4. Increased PTT and INR: The elevated clotting times indicate a potential risk of bleeding, especially considering the patient's thrombocytopenia. Vitamin K administration has been given to address this"

   patient has end stage heart failure, and his prognosis has been
   discussed with him, his wife and daughter many times.  On prior
   admissions, it was understood that there would be no more escalations
   of care, as medical therapy for his heart failure had been maximized.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8762**] discussed goals of care with patient, wife and daughter
   yesterday.  [**Name2 (NI) 133**] likely need to have frequent family meetings to
   reinforce the prognosis of his heart failurem and the limited treatment
   options available.  For now patient is full code.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old gentleman with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF), atrial fibrillation, mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a recent weight gain. He was admitted with lethargy, hypotension, and anemia. His current condition includes persistent hypotension despite fluid boluses, ongoing hypotension in the 70s systolic, and the need for pressors. A PICC line has been placed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's persistent hypotension could lead to organ perfusion issues and potentially result in shock.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's weight gain and elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels indicate worsening heart failure. This can lead to fluid accumulation and pulmonary edema.
3. Anemia/Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient's low hemoglobin (Hct) levels suggest anemia, which could be due to gastrointestinal bleeding or another cause. Further evaluation is needed to determine the source of bleeding.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if there is concurrent anemia or ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding.
5. Increased PTT and INR: Elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 72-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation, who was admitted to the ICU for acute decompensated heart failure. Upon admission, the patient's blood pressure was low, and he required diuretics for fluid management. The patient's kidney function was noted to be slightly elevated with a baseline creatinine level of 3.0 mg/dL.

During the course of treatment, the patient experienced transient hypotension after restarting metoprolol, which resulted in the discontinuation of the medication. The patient also received a unit of red blood cells due to hypotension and a low blood count.

The patient's vital signs have been unstable, with low blood pressure ranging from 63-84 mmHg and heart rate between 72-117 beats per minute. Oxygen saturation has been maintained at around 94%. The patient's temperature has been within normal limits.

Fluid balance has shown a negative balance of 85 mL over the past 24 hours, indicating ongoing diuresis. The patient's weight has decreased from 72.6 kg at admission to 74.1 kg currently.

Laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's electrolytes are within normal range, except for a slightly low calcium level.

Imaging revealed marked cardiomegaly with extensive left lower lobe atelectasis and minimal density changes suggestive of"

","Summary:
The patient is a thin elderly male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of 24-hour events. The patient's HCT increased from 23.6 to 24.6, and his blood urea levels were elevated at 3. The patient's blood pressure was holding steady but was still low, so diuresis was held. Metoprolol was restarted at 6.25 mg, but it caused hypotension and was discontinued. The patient received 1 unit of red blood cells to help with blood pressure. The patient's family discussed DNR/DNI and is leaning towards changing the code status. The patient has allergies to quinidine and propranolol. The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission. The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 84/60 to 63/30 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. The patient's weight is 74.1 kg, with a total fluid input of 865 mL, including 77 mL of IV fluids, and a total fluid output of 950 mL, with 85 mL being urine output. The patient has mild right crackles at the base of the lungs and has a harsh systolic murmur in the right upper sternal border. The patient's abdomen is mildly tense and non-tender, with"

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is a very nice 87 year-old gentleman with HTN, diastolic CHF
   (EF 65% 1/10), AFib not on Coumadin, and mild AS, Stage IV CKD who
   comes with a ""drop"" in his HCT and elevated creatinine and weight.
   .
   #. Hypotension
 Secondary to end stage cardiac disease as HCT has been
   stable. Patient hypotensive on admission to SBP 70s, MAPS ~50 with HR
   in the 50s.  Given multiple fluid boluses with good response.  Lungs
   clear yesterday am.  PICC placed for possible pressors. Given CHF, both
   fluids and pressors not indicated, but we have limited options as he is
   full code.
   -Holding on diuresis given hypotension yesterday  in setting of IV
   lasix  100 mg IV, and low suspicion for pulm edema.
   -Restarted metoporolol at 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday but d/cd as pt had
   transient episode of hypotension with SBP to 63 at 1400.
   -Given 1u RBCs in evening to help with BP.
   - follow up cardiology recs
   .
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure - Patient with EF of 65%
   gaining weight according to rehab (13 pounds), despite higher torsemide
   dose. He does not report any dietary changes and has been on ""no salt
   added"" diet. He takes his medications as prescribed and no signs of
   infections. No clear precipitant, however he is slowly gaining weight.
   Again, hypotensive as above.  Ideally we would like to keep him on his
   home BB but his hypotension is limiting.
   - cardiology recs
   - Hold torsemide
   - restart metoprolol 6.25mg PO bid as BP tolerates
   - Daily standing weight
   - Continue rate control for AFib
   .
   #. Anemia / GIB?
 Hct 23 on admission, now improved at 26.2 after
   receiving 1u RBCs yesterday.
   - GI recs: no plan for scope this admission
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT.
   - if continuing to decrease, will transfuse 1U PRBC
   .
   #. Thrombocytopenia
improvement over yesterday 87
 101 today, HIT
   antibody pending.
   - f/u HIT antibody
   - [**Hospital1 **] PLTs
   .
   #. Increased PTT and INR -  given vitamin K on admission. INR 1.3 this
   morning.
   - [**Name (NI) **] PT, PTT
   .
   #. Increased AP and GGT with elevated lipase and an abnormality on
   ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass.
   - MRCP per GI, can plan as outpatient
   .
   #. Chronic atrial fibrillation - Patient with CHADS2 of 2 who is on
   low-dose aspirin and had his coumadin recently stopped
   - metoprolol 6.25mg PO bid, uptitrate as tolerated.
   .
   #. Chronic renal failure - Patient with creatinine of 3 at his new
   baseline since [**2140-9-29**]. His eGFR by MDRD formula is 24 ml/min. He
   is on torsemide 60 mg PO BID for his chronic heart failure, which may
   be contributing to his increased creatinine, but imrpoving his overall
   status. It is recommend to check PTH every 3 months with target of
   70-110.  PTH 200.
   - [**Year (4 digits) **] creatinine, slightly increased today at 3.3 from 3.0 on
   admission, likely secondary to poor forward flow from underlying
   cardiac disease. (but at pt
s baseline)
   . .
   #. Hypercholesterolemia - his last lipid profile included LDL 62, HDL
   85, Chol 156 and TG of 43 in [**2139-9-30**].  Repeat lipids wnl.
   - Continue simvastatin
   .
   #. Vitamin D deficiency - pt with VD of 17. He is currently on
   maintainance therapy.
   - Cont VD given improvement of ICU outcomes (among other things)
   # Goals of Care
 Per OMR and discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8762**], and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **],
   patient has end stage heart failure, and his prognosis has been
   discussed with him, his wife and daughter many times.  On prior
   admissions, it was understood that there would be no more escalations
   of care, as medical therapy for his heart failure had been maximized.
   Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 8762**] discussed goals of care with patient, wife and daughter on
   [**3-18**].  Family meeting held last night re: code status; family leaning
   more towards DNR/DNI but final decision not yet made.  Will likely need
   to have frequent family meetings to reinforce the prognosis of his
   heart failure and the limited treatment options available.  For now
   patient is full code.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (CHF) with an ejection fraction of 65%, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, and mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD). 

The patient presented with a ""drop"" in hematocrit (HCT) and elevated creatinine, indicating worsening renal function. The patient's blood pressure has been unstable, with hypotension on admission and a low mean arterial pressure (MAP). Fluid resuscitation was given, but the patient remains hypotensive, likely secondary to end-stage cardiac disease. 

The patient has been gaining weight despite higher doses of diuretics, suggesting possible fluid overload or worsening heart failure. Metoprolol, a beta-blocker, was restarted but had to be discontinued due to transient hypotension. 

The patient also has thrombocytopenia with an improving platelet count and is being evaluated for HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). There is an increased PTT (partial thromboplastin time) and INR (international normalized ratio), for which vitamin K has been administered.

The patient has increased alkaline phosphatase (AP) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), along with elevated lipase and an abnormality on ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass. Further evaluation with MR"

   Assessment and Plan
   87 yo male admitted with GI bleed and anemia secondary to blood loss.
   He has maintained significant hypotension across time and now has C.
   Diff seen as positive on stool culture.  He maintains severe
   hypotension with likely a combination of severe compromise of cardiac
   function now complicated by C. Diff colitis and with some volume loss
   and concern for exacerbation of effective cardiac function in that
   setting of active infection.
   1)HYPOTENSION
Patient with recurrent and persistent hypotension in the
   setting of diarrhea and impaired systolic function chronically.  We
   have held diuretics and antihypertensives and will have to match losses
   across next 24 hours.
   -JVD will be monitored
   -Goal I/O is even for today
   -Will hold diuretics at this time
   -Rx for C. Diff is in place
po Vanco in place in combination with
   flagyl
   2)Congestive Heart Failure-
   -Will hold diuretics at this time
   -Will continue to hold anti-hypertensives
   -Follow oxygenation
   -ASA held with concern for blood loss anemia
   -Maintain I/O even across today
   -Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to see patient as primary cardiologist and aid in treatment
   planning
   3)Chronic Renal Failure-
   -Is at baseline
   -Follow in vs. out and will need to continue to maintain urine flow as
   possible

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male admitted with gastrointestinal (GI) bleed and anemia secondary to blood loss. He has persistent hypotension, positive Clostridium difficile (C. Diff) in stool culture, and significant compromise of cardiac function. The patient's vital signs are unstable, with low blood pressure, tachycardia, and low oxygen saturation. The patient's physical examination reveals crackles at the right lung base, diminished breath sounds, and bilateral lower extremity edema. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, and abnormal kidney function. The patient's imaging shows an increase in right lower lobe opacity on chest X-ray. The patient is diagnosed with hypotension, congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, and C. Diff colitis. The plan includes holding diuretics and antihypertensives, monitoring jugular venous distension, maintaining even intake and output, and initiating treatment for C. Diff. The patient's code status is DNR/DNI, and he is currently in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's positive C. Diff in stool culture, persistent hypotension, and elevated white blood cell count suggest a potential infection leading to sepsis.
2. Cardiogenic shock: The patient's compromised cardiac function, low blood pressure, and hypotension could lead to cardiogenic shock.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 65%), atrial fibrillation, mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease, and previous episodes of Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. The patient presents with acute renal failure, anemia, and worsening respiratory status. He has been treated for C. diff infection twice before. The patient's vital signs show hypotension and tachycardia. His laboratory results indicate elevated creatinine levels, decreased hemoglobin concentration, thrombocytopenia, increased alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and elevated lipase with a pancreatic mass suspected on ultrasound. The patient's imaging reveals worsening pneumonia in the right lung base, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, mild pulmonary vascular congestion, and left retrocardiac opacity.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile infection: The patient has a history of previous C. diff infections and is currently being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. It is important to monitor for signs of worsening infection or recurrence.
2. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's weight gain, despite increased diuretic dose, along with the absence of clear precipitants, suggests worsening heart failure. Holding Torsemide and Metoprolol may be necessary due to hypotension"

   comes with a ""drop"" in his HCT and elevated creatinine and weight.
   #. Hypotension: Secondary to end stage cardiac disease as HCT has been
   stable. Patient hypotensive on admission to SBP 70s, MAPS ~50 with HR
   in the 50s.  Given multiple fluid boluses with good response.  Lungs
   clear yesterday am.  PICC placed for possible pressors. Given CHF, both
   fluids and pressors not indicated, but we have limited options as he is
   full code.
   -Holding on diuresis given hypotension yesterday  in setting of IV
   lasix  100 mg IV, and low suspicion for pulm edema.
   -Restarted metoporolol at 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 7**] yesterday but d/cd as pt had
   transient episode of hypotension with SBP to 63 at 1400.
   -Given 1u RBCs in evening to help with BP.
   - follow up cardiology recs
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure: Patient with EF of 65%
   gaining weight according to rehab (13 pounds), despite higher torsemide
   dose. He does not report any dietary changes and has been on ""no salt
   added"" diet. He takes his medications as prescribed and no signs of
   infections. No clear precipitant, however he is slowly gaining weight.
   Again, hypotensive as above.  Ideally we would like to keep him on his
   home BB but his hypotension is limiting.
   - cardiology recs
   - Hold torsemide
   - restart metoprolol 6.25mg PO bid as BP tolerates
   - Daily standing weight
   - Continue rate control for AFib
   #. Anemia / GIB?: Hct 23 on admission, now improved at 26.2 after
   receiving 1u RBCs yesterday.
   - GI recs: no plan for scope this admission
   - [**Hospital1 **] HCT
   - if continuing to decrease, will transfuse 1U PRBC
   #. Thrombocytopenia: improvement over yesterday 87
 101 today, HIT
   antibody pending.
   - f/u HIT antibody
   - [**Hospital1 **] PLTs
   #. Increased PTT and INR:  given vitamin K on admission. INR 1.3 this
   morning.
   - [**Name (NI) **] PT, PTT
   #. Increased AP and GGT with elevated lipase and an abnormality on
   ultrasound suggestive of a pancreatic mass.
   - MRCP per GI, can plan as outpatient
   #. Chronic atrial fibrillation: Patient with CHADS2 of 2 who is on
   low-dose aspirin and had his coumadin recently stopped
   - metoprolol 6.25mg PO bid, uptitrate as tolerated.
   #. Chronic renal failure: Patient with creatinine of 3 at his new
   baseline since [**2140-9-29**]. His eGFR by MDRD formula is 24 ml/min. He
   is on torsemide 60 mg PO BID for his chronic heart failure, which may
   be contributing to his increased creatinine, but imrpoving his overall
   status. It is recommend to check PTH every 3 months with target of
   70-110.  PTH 200.
   - [**Year (4 digits) **] creatinine, slightly increased today at 3.3 from 3.0 on
   admission, likely secondary to poor forward flow from underlying
   cardiac disease. (but at pt
s baseline)
   #. Hypercholesterolemia: his last lipid profile included LDL 62, HDL
   85, Chol 156 and TG of 43 in [**2139-9-30**].  Repeat lipids wnl.
   - Continue Simvastatin
   #. Vitamin D deficiency - pt with VD of 17. He is currently on

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (EF 65%), atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, mild aortic stenosis, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He was admitted with acute renal failure, anemia, and C. difficile colitis. The patient has been treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin for C. difficile, but his condition remains unstable. He is also experiencing hypotension secondary to end-stage cardiac disease and infection. The patient has been given multiple fluid boluses with transient response and has a PICC line placed for possible pressors. His lungs are clear, but he is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. C. difficile colitis: The patient has a history of recurrent C. difficile infections and is currently being treated with IV Flagyl and PO Vancomycin. It is important to monitor his symptoms and laboratory results to ensure resolution of the infection.
2. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be due to end-stage cardiac disease and infection. Fluid resuscitation and possible pressors may be necessary to maintain adequate blood pressure.
3. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient's weight gain and worsening symptoms suggest exacerbation of his chronic heart failure. Cardiology recommendations should be followed, including holding diuretics and beta-blockers.

","Summary:
The patient is an 80-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure and anemia. The family has changed the patient's code status to DNR/DNI. The patient requires numerous IV fluid boluses due to low blood pressure, but there is no significant improvement in urine output. The patient is started on IV Flagyl and PO vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection. Cardiology recommends transferring the patient to the CCU and performing MRCP when stable. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.9°C, heart rate of 97 bpm, blood pressure of 81/39 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on nasal cannula. The patient is in atrial fibrillation. Lab results show elevated creatinine levels and low blood glucose. Imaging shows worsening pneumonia in the right lung base and increased pleural effusion, along with marked cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary vascular congestion.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Worsening renal function: The patient's elevated creatinine levels indicate acute renal failure, which can lead to further deterioration in kidney function and accumulation of waste products in the body.
2. Infection: The patient is already being treated for Clostridium difficile infection, and the presence of worsening pneumonia suggests a possible respiratory infection. Infections can worsen the patient's condition and may require additional interventions.
3. Hypotension:"

   Assessment and Plan
   Patient with continued need for IVf and PRBC for persistent hypotension
   in the setting of severe compromise of cardiac funciton.  This has been
   a trigger for increased levels of need and support with patient now
   seen to have requirement for foley and rectal catheter.  He has had
   good response to IVF and PRBC support and been able to maintain a
   perfusing pressure.

   care
at this time he has continued statement that he is too
   uncomfortable to go on and would rather be dead.  This is a short term
   complaint with patient having substantial discomfort but we have
   expectation for possible recovery and medically the treatment required
   is not considered extraordinary measures
po antibiotics and a rectal
   tube and we emphasized that we would continue to treat.  If we are not
   seeing any improvement or are seeing continuous clinical decline
   certainly CMO status could be entertained but at this time will proceed

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with congestive heart failure, C. diff colitis, and atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently on IV fluids and receiving PRBC transfusion due to persistent hypotension and severe compromise of cardiac function. He has been diagnosed with D. Diff infection and is being treated with oral vancomycin and IV Flagyl. The patient's medical history includes acute anemia secondary to blood loss, acute thrombocytopenia, chronic diastolic heart failure, and chronic renal failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Severe compromise of cardiac function leading to further deterioration in heart failure.
2. Persistent hypotension resulting in inadequate organ perfusion.
3. Infection due to D. Diff colitis.
4. Bleeding complications due to thrombocytopenia.
5. Acute kidney injury or worsening of chronic renal failure.
6. Metabolic disturbances such as electrolyte imbalances and abnormal blood glucose levels.
7. Respiratory distress due to crackles in the chest and compromised respiratory function.
8. Potential need for intubation and mechanical ventilation if respiratory status worsens.
9. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and risk of venous stasis.
10. Stress ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding due to prolonged ICU stay and use of invasive lines and tubes."

   Assessment and Plan
   Mr. [**Known lastname 14060**] is a very nice 87 year-old gentleman with HTN, diastolic CHF
   (EF 65% 1/10), AFib not on Coumadin, and mild AS, Stage IV CKD who
   comes with a ""drop"" in his HCT and elevated creatinine and weight.
   #. C. difficile colitis: Patient with C. diff toxin positive from [**3-19**],
   previously treated for C. difficile twice in the past. On IV Flagyl &
   PO Vancomycin with subsequent decrease in WBC. Afebrile. Stool output
   minimal over past 24 hours, but as patient with Stage II sacral ulcer,
   should ensure ability to use commode safely prior to removing
   flexiseal.
   - Continue Flagyl & Vancomycin, day 3
   - Flexiseal in place for now, will re-address later today based on
   stool output
   - IVF
s to ensure adequate fluid resuscitation for GI losses
   - [**Month/Year (2) **] WBC & fever curve
   #. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart failure: Patient with EF of 65%
   gaining weight according to rehab (13 pounds), despite higher Torsemide
   dose. No clear precipitant, and Torsemide & BB held in context of
   hypotension. Patient not requiring O2 this AM.
   - Cardiology recs
   - Hold Torsemide
   - Hold Metoprolol
   - Daily standing weight
   #. Oliguric Acute on chronic renal failure: Patient with creatinine of
   3 at his new baseline since [**2140-9-29**]. Cr this AM 3.6, only required
   1 500cc fluid bolus. Likely secondary to poor forward flow from
   underlying cardiac disease as GI losses from C. diff were minimal over
   the past 24 hours.
   - Continue to hold Torsemide 60 mg PO BID for his chronic heart failure
   given hypotension & ARF
   - [**Year (4 digits) **] creatinine
   - Renally dose all medications
   - Avoid nephrotoxic agents
   - Continue IVF boluses PRN as respiratory status tolerates
   #. Hypotension: Improved. SBP

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure (ejection fraction 65%), atrial fibrillation, mild aortic stenosis, stage IV chronic kidney disease, and recent episodes of Clostridium difficile colitis. He presented with acute renal failure and anemia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and has been receiving various treatments, including blood transfusions, antibiotics, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Acute on Chronic Diastolic Heart Failure: The patient's weight gain and elevated creatinine levels indicate worsening heart failure. Torsemide and beta-blockers have been held due to hypotension. Further evaluation by cardiology is recommended, and the patient should continue to be monitored for signs of fluid overload or worsening heart failure.

2. Oliguric Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's creatinine level has increased to 3.6, indicating worsening renal function. This may be secondary to poor forward flow from underlying cardiac disease. Medications should be adjusted based on renal function, and nephrotoxic agents should be avoided. The patient should continue to receive IV fluid boluses as needed for respiratory status.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure has improved since receiving 1 unit of packed red blood cells. However, the patient remains hypotensive, and careful monitoring is necessary. IV fluid boluses may"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old male with a history of hypertension, diastolic congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation not on Coumadin, mild aortic stenosis, and stage IV chronic kidney disease. He presented with acute renal failure and anemia. The patient had a positive HIT assay, so anticoagulation was not started due to his history of gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis. He received 1 unit of packed red blood cells. His blood pressure was initially low but has improved since then. The patient's respiratory status has also improved, and he no longer requires supplemental oxygen. He was given a 500cc fluid bolus for low blood pressure. The patient was comfortable overnight with Ativan. He was weaned off oxygen this morning.

Medical Complications:
1. Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient has an ejection fraction of 65%, and there is weight gain despite a higher dose of Torsemide. No clear precipitant is identified, and Torsemide and beta-blockers are held due to hypotension. The patient is not requiring oxygen this morning.

","The patient is a 60-year-old male admitted to the ICU with acute renal failure and anemia. The patient received 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and was found to have a positive HIT assay with a calculated 4Ts score of 3 points, indicating a low probability of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). However, the patient has a history of gastrointestinal bleed and epistaxis while on coumadin, so anticoagulation was not started.

The patient's blood pressure has been in the 70s and received a 500 cc bolus for stabilization. The patient has allergies to quinidine and propranolol. The last doses of antibiotics, metronidazole and vancomycin, were given on 03/22/2141 at 04:29 AM and 06:20 AM, respectively.

The patient is currently receiving lorazepam (Ativan) and pantoprazole (Protonix) as part of their ICU medications. There are no changes to the patient's medical and family history. The review of systems is unchanged from admission except for acute renal failure and anemia.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (97%), heart rate of 78 bpm (66-88 bpm), blood pressure of 106/73 mmHg (80/50-108/80 mmHg), respiratory rate of 15 breaths per"

The patient received antibiotic treatment and careful volume support with an IV fluid bolus, resulting in reasonable stability of blood pressure over the past 24 hours.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 35.3°C (95.6°F), heart rate of 74 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 97/65 mmHg to 74/41 mmHg, respiratory rate of 11 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's weight is currently 75.1 kg, with a height of 60 inches. 

The patient has been diagnosed with C. Difficile infection (C. Diff colitis), congestive heart failure, chronic renal failure, hematuria, and HIT (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia). 

Assessment and plan:
1. C. Difficile infection: The patient will continue with oral vancomycin, rectal tube administration, and gradual transition to out-of-bed activities if tolerated.
2. Congestive heart failure: The patient has been weaned off supplemental oxygen and will continue to receive fluid support as needed. Beta-blocker therapy has been temporarily held, and the decision will be made based on blood pressure and heart rate stability.
