   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by
   phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**]; H - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**].

   Code status: DNR (do not resuscitate)
   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and dementia. She was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with acute respiratory failure. The patient also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hyperinflated lungs on chest X-ray.

The patient's current condition includes myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure, hypoventilation, bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and communication issues regarding the patient's care.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 36.1°C (96.9°F)
- Heart rate: 43 bpm
- Blood pressure: 122/51 mmHg (91/40-154/109 mmHg)
- Respiratory rate: 12 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), creatinine (Cr), lactate, liver enzymes (ALT, AST), D-dimer, and low levels of hemoglobin (Hct), platelets (Plt), fibrinogen, and albumin. The ECG shows bilateral atrial enlargement, but no evidence of overt pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

The patient's treatment plan includes continuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia, performing a follow-up CT chest with contrast for possible pulmonary embolism, and continuing ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD. The family wishes to hold off on diagnostic tests and does not want to escalate care, including no use of pressors, transcutaneous pacing, or CPR.

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening respiratory failure, further deterioration of cardiac function leading to cardiogenic shock, progression of acute kidney injury, development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcers, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and possible sepsis due to the presence of multiple comorbidities and infections.

Please note that the patient's condition is deteriorating, and the family has expressed a desire not to escalate care beyond the current measures."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, previous stroke, hypertension, and hyponatremia. She was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated upon admission. The patient has multiple comorbidities, including myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, and possible pulmonary embolism. She also has hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, elevated troponin levels, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Distress: The patient's current saturation is 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5. L-sided pleural effusion appears greatly improved, but R pleural effusion persists. The lung parenchyma does not show signs of overt pulmonary edema on chest X-ray.

2. Hypotension: This is likely hypovolemic in the setting of poor oral intake. There is concern for sepsis given lactate but no leukocytosis, tachycardia, or fever. Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, and urinary tract infection.

3. Coagulopathy: DIC is a concern with elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, low HCT, and low fibr"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is in the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and respiratory failure. The patient experienced unplanned extubation and required re-intubation for acidemia. The patient also had a slow leak from their fem line, which needed to be addressed. 

The patient's vital signs show a heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 122/51 mmHg to 154/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's temperature is slightly below normal, with a Tcurrent of 35.8°C (96.5°F). 

The patient's lab results indicate elevated levels of white blood cells, hemoglobin, glucose, D-dimer, lactate, lipase, troponin-T, and various liver enzymes. The patient's potassium and magnesium levels are low, while their calcium level is on the lower end of normal.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including midazolam, fentanyl, piperacillin/tazobactam, and vancomycin. The patient's family has chosen a DNR (do not resuscitate) status.

Potential medical complications that could arise for this patient include further deterioration of respiratory function, development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and potential infections due to the presence of central lines and urinary catheters.

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory distress:  Current satting 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural
   effusion persists though likely not large enough to cause agonal
   breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear too bad--no
   ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion of overt pulm edema on
   CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show
   bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated
   on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - consider ECHO to assess for RV strain
   - hold empiric anticoagulation at this time
   - ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers
   - hold on steroids for now
   .
   # Hypotension:  This is likely hypovolemic in setting of poor po
   intake.  Also concern for sepsis given lactate but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.  [**Month (only) 11**] also be cardiac.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - serial CEs
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  DIC is a concern with elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  No active
   bleeding.  INR increasing, likely nutritional, however also with
   elevated LFTs.
   - check hemolysis labs, peripheral smear for schistocytes
   - trend coags, CBC
   - vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # Elevated troponin:  Likely from cardiac arrest.  Did not appear to
   have received electric shocks.
   - serial CEs, EKG
   - ASA
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - check urine lytes, sed, eos.
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - follow LFTs
   - check hep A, B, C serologies
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - check hemolysis labs, retic count
   - guaiac stools
   - monitor CBC [**Hospital1 **]

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia. She was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, leading to intubation. The patient has several medical complications and conditions, including myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), COPD, hyperinflated lungs, pleural effusions, potential pulmonary embolism, hypotension, sepsis, coagulopathy, acidemia, elevated troponin, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and DNR code status.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure, pneumonia, further myocardial damage, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, septic shock, bleeding due to coagulopathy, worsening kidney function, hepatic dysfunction, worsening anemia, thrombocytopenia, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular events, and osteoporotic fractures.

It is important to closely monitor and manage these conditions to prevent complications and improve the patient's overall health outcome."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Unclear sepsis source, but empirical coverage with antimicrobials.
   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Monitor abd exam
   for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION -- unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in recent past.
   Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious pathology identified
   by abd CT, but need to await final interpretation).  Plan to trend
   serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.  Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  Would like to either resite or d/c.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology.  Concerns include hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Unclear sepsis source, but empirical coverage with antimicrobials.
   Monitor BP, maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual who presented with respiratory failure. The patient self-extubated yesterday and required reintubation due to ventilatory failure. They remain intubated and mechanically ventilated. The patient exhibited progressive bradycardia overnight but did not experience hemodynamic compromise.

Medical History:
The patient has a medical history of unknown precipitant for admission, possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or neurological event (CVA or seizure). There is uncertainty about the presence of underlying lung disease. The patient's allergies include a last dose of antibiotics (Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam) on 08/12/2149.

Review of Systems:
The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the following: cardiovascular symptoms including bradycardia, and neurological symptoms such as sedation and encephalopathy.

Physical Examination:
The patient appears well-nourished, not in acute distress, and is frail-appearing. They have PERRL (pupils equal and reactive to light), normocephalic head, endotracheal tube in place, and no cervical adenopathy. Cardiovascular examination shows a normal PMI (point of maximal impulse), normal S1 and S2 heart sounds, no murmurs, and no signs of peripheral edema. Respiratory examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdominal examination shows soft, non-tender"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they

   Disposition:
","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hyponatremia. She was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, and was subsequently intubated.

The patient has multiple medical complications, including myocardial infarction (MI), acute respiratory failure, hypoventilation, pleural effusion, bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and communication difficulties.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 43 bpm, blood pressure of 138/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 40%. The patient is hemodynamically stable but remains bradycardic.

The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cell count, hematocrit, lactate, and D-dimer. The blood culture shows Gram-positive cocci in clusters and chains. Other lab results indicate abnormalities in liver function tests, coagulation profile, electrolytes, and renal function.

The patient's medical plan includes continuing antibiotics to cover hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), ipratropium/albuterol ne"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - f/u CT chest with contrast for ?PE
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction.  While patient was
   initially hemodynamically stable, urine output is diminishing and
   condition is deteriorating
   -EKG to assess for sinal node block
   -check TSH for concern of hypothyroidism
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Also concern for sepsis given
   lactate but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible
   sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - follow up Bcxs
   - check LFTs (lipase nl)
   - cont. vanc/zosyn
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.
   - give 2 units FFP, given vitamin K
   -pull femoral line, no central access necessary as patient does not
   wish to escalate care
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis:
   - cont. calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia, who presented to the ED for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated upon admission. The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and respiratory failure, not ARDS. She has a history of COPD and has shown improvement in her left-sided pleural effusion but still has a right pleural effusion. There are no signs of pulmonary edema on chest X-ray. The patient's condition is deteriorating, with diminishing urine output and worsening cardiac dysfunction. She has bradycardia and hypotension, which may be multifactorial in nature. There is also a concern for sepsis. The patient has a coagulopathy with elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, low HCT, and low fibrinogen, which may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction. She has acidemia, likely due to respiratory acidosis and lactic acidosis. The patient also has acute kidney injury (ARF) and transaminitis, possibly from shock liver. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present with a baseline HCT of 40. The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and osteoporosis. The family does not wish to escalate care"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology.  Concerns include hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill and currently intubated in the ICU. The patient has respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, bacteremia, dilated right atrium, hypotension, hypocalcemia, lactic acid elevation, and elevated liver function tests. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the patient being intubated and mechanically ventilated, there is a risk of developing pneumonia as a result of the mechanical ventilation.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and critical illness increase the risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins of the legs, which can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.
3. Nosocomial infections: The patient is at risk of acquiring infections while in the ICU, such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or urinary tract infections.
4. Cardiac events: Bradycardia and potential cardiac arrest suggest an underlying cardiac condition, which may lead to further cardiac events.
5. Organ dysfunction: Elevated liver enzymes and lactic acid levels indicate possible organ dysfunction, which could progress if not properly managed.

These are potential complications that may arise based on the information provided in the progress note."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is critically ill with respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, hypothyroidism, bacteremia, dilated right atrium, hypotension, hypocalcemia, lactic acid elevation, LFT elevation, and fluids hypovolemia. 

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is intubated and mechanically ventilated, indicating severe respiratory distress. Complications may include ventilator-associated pneumonia, barotrauma, or ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Pulseless arrest: The patient experienced a cardiac arrest, which can lead to further complications such as hypoxic brain injury or post-cardiac arrest syndrome.
3. Bradycardia: The slow heart rate can result in inadequate perfusion and oxygen delivery to organs, potentially causing organ damage.
4. Hypothyroidism: Untreated hypothyroidism can lead to further complications such as cardiovascular disease, myxedema coma, or developmental delays.
5. Bacteremia: The presence of bacteria in the bloodstream can progress to sepsis or septic shock, leading to organ failure and increased mortality.
6. Dilated right atrium: This finding may suggest right-sided heart strain or pulmonary hypertension, which can lead to further cardiac complications like heart failure or arrhythmias.
7. Hypotension: Persistent low blood pressure can result in inadequate organ perfusion and may lead"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - remove femoral line and obtain adequate hemostasis
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives previously held
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/ced simvastatin
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, recent echo shows mildly
   dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this time.  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.  No recent blood
   gases given that art line dc
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes trending down
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - femoral line removed yesterday, crit stabilized
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and multiple comorbidities. She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and has been intubated.

The patient's vital signs show bradycardia (heart rate of 45 bpm) and hypotension (blood pressure of 130/53 mmHg). Her respiratory support includes being on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, FiO2 of 50%, and PEEP of 5 cmH2O.

The patient's laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count (WBC), slightly decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hct), low platelet count (Plt), elevated creatinine (Cr), and abnormal liver function tests (ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili). The coagulation profile shows prolonged prothrombin time (PTT) and international normalized ratio (INR), while fibrinogen levels are low. The patient also has elevated levels of lactate, D-dimer, and lactic acidosis.

The assessment and plan section of the note includes multiple diagnoses and concerns. The patient is diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), bradycardia, hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and acute respiratory failure. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube and is being treated for a drug-eluting stent-related thrombosis. The patient's vital signs show hypothermia, bradycardia, and hypotension. Fluid balance indicates an intake of 1540 mL and output of 1820 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 280 mL. Laboratory results show elevated troponin levels, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal electrolyte levels. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. The patient's code status is DNR.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Cardiogenic shock: Given the patient's history of myocardial infarction and ongoing hemodynamic instability, there is a risk of developing cardiogenic shock.
2. Pneumonia: The patient's acute respiratory failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation increase the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters can increase the risk of developing DVT.
4. Stress ulcers: The ICU stay and the use of vasopressors can predispose the patient to stress ulcers.
5. Ventilator-associated events: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation puts him at risk for various"

   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current sating 100% on FiO2 40%, PEEP 5.
   Re-intubated yesterday after self extubation [**3-17**] acidemia likely due to
   hypoventilation.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by
   deconditioning or sedation.  There does not appear to be profound
   intrapulmonary process.  L-sided effusion appears greatly improved from
   [**2149-8-2**].  R pleural effusion persists though likely not large enough to
   cause agonal breathing.  The lung parenchyma itself does not appear
   markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no suggestion
   of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though
   prior ECGs show bilateral AE, no ECHO in system).  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - grandson asked to hold off on diagnostic [**Female First Name (un) 231**]
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   -limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV
   -limit  sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line
   - continue vitamin K
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - hepatitis panel is pending
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy

   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish  for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and dementia. She was brought to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress and subsequently intubated.

The patient's current condition is summarized as follows:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on 100% FiO2 and PEEP 5. She was re-intubated after self-extubation and likely experienced hypoventilation due to deconditioning or sedation. There is no evidence of profound intrapulmonary process.

2. Bradycardia: The patient has a heart rate of 45 bpm, which is bradycardic. It is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She is hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.

3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is 130/53 mmHg. This is likely multifactorial, considering poor oral intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis. There is a concern for sepsis given elevated lactate levels and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs), but no leukocytosis, tachycardia, or fever.

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation while awaiting final
   family decision regarding extubation and comfort care.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Total time spent: 35 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is critically ill and intubated in the ICU. The patient's medical history is unclear due to sedation, language barrier, and endotracheal tube. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 35.7 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 46 beats per minute, blood pressure of 144/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and an FiO2 of 50%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of pain or discomfort. 

The patient has several medical complications, including respiratory failure with unclear precipitant, pulseless arrest that may be related to the induction and intubation event, bradycardia with unclear etiology, hypothyroidism with TSH greater than 25, bacteremia with GPC from ER blood culture, dilated right atrium possibly due to right-side valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension, hypotension with unclear cause, hypocalcemia, lactic acid elevation, and elevated liver function tests. 

The patient's labs show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 15.9 thousand/mm3, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 91 thousand/mm3, elevated creatinine"

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation, adjust working towards
   SBT and extubation (previously DNR/DNI).  Assess for cardiac event.
   Consider head CT and EEG.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O.
   IV ACCESS -- Left femoral line.  As per family discussion, will d/c and
   use peripheral iv.  No plan for central lines.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual who is currently intubated and mechanically ventilated in the ICU. They have a history of respiratory failure, with unclear precipitants. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 35.7°C (96.3°F), heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 106/45-155/109 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's physical examination reveals no acute distress, well-nourished appearance, and no signs of pain or discomfort.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial presentation and ongoing need for mechanical ventilation indicate ongoing respiratory failure. The cause of this condition is unclear and requires further investigation.
2. Pulseless Arrest: The patient experienced a pulseless arrest, which has been stabilized without further hemodynamic complications. It is unclear whether this event was related to the precipitant for admission or the induction and intubation process.
3. Bradyarrhythmia: The patient exhibits bradycardia with an unclear etiology. Possible causes include hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease.
4. Hypothyroidism: The patient's TSH level is significantly elevated, suggesting hypothyroidism. Synthroid replacement therapy should be initiated.
5. Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia with GPC from an ER blood culture. Vancomycin"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR.  [**Month (only) 11**] consider PE given marked
   [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE, recent echo shows mildly
   dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this time.  Has a history of
   COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - family mtg today to discuss goals of care
   - cont. vanc/zosyn to cover HAP
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 25 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  This is likely multifactorial in setting of poor po
   intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.  Possible sources of infection
   include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains: continue vancomycin
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt has a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.  No recent blood
   gases given that art line dc
   - [**Month (only) 11**] allow higher PCO2
   - IVFs for lactic acidosis
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes trending down
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - femoral line removed yesterday, crit stabilized
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Grandson [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, hypertension, and hyponatremia. She was admitted to the ICU for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, requiring intubation. The patient has been diagnosed with myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), hypotension, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury, transaminitis, anemia/thrombocytopenia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and communication issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. However, hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation. There does not appear to be a profound intrapulmonary process.
2. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, which may be due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
3. Hypotension: This is likely multifactorial in the setting of poor oral intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis. There is concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs). Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.

   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,

   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,

   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.

   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low

   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and dementia, admitted for respiratory distress and intubated. She has been stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. Her lung parenchyma does not appear markedly abnormal, and there is no evidence of pulmonary edema. The patient's blood pressure is stable, but she has bradycardia, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She also has hypotension, which is multifactorial, and there are concerns about sepsis. The patient has a coagulopathy, likely due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction. Her kidney function is impaired, possibly due to hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is evidence of transaminitis, likely from shock liver. The patient has anemia and thrombocytopenia, and her electrolytes are within normal range. The family does not wish to escalate care, and the patient's clinical status is deteriorating.

Potential medical complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia indicate a potential respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and respiratory effort is necessary.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's heart rate is low, which may lead to decreased cardiac output. Close monitoring of heart rate and blood"

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions are:

1. Myocardial Infarction: The patient may experience further cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, or heart failure.

2. Acute Respiratory Failure: The patient may develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, or barotrauma due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

3. Hypoventilation: The patient may develop hypercapnia, respiratory acidosis, and increased intracranial pressure.

4. Bradycardia: The patient may experience worsening cardiac dysfunction, decreased cardiac output, and potential hemodynamic instability.

5. Hypotension: The patient may develop septic shock, organ dysfunction, and potential multiorgan failure.

6. Coagulopathy: The patient may experience bleeding or clotting complications due to the imbalance in clotting factors and platelet count.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.9°F), a heart rate of 46 bpm with sinus bradycardia, blood pressure ranging from 124/45 mmHg to 174/64 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute with spontaneous respiration not present, and oxygen saturation at 100% on endotracheal tube with FiO2 50%. The patient is receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation management.

The patient's review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the addition of mild left upper extremity weakness noted on [**2149-8-11**] 08:57 AM. The patient's physical examination reveals no new findings since admission.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, decreased hemoglobin, and elevated troponin T levels. Other lab values are within normal range or show no significant abnormalities.

The patient's respiratory support includes ventilation with a tidal volume set at 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) at 50%. The patient's ABG results"

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure. He remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation. His vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 174/64 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient is sedated and unresponsive. 

The patient's labs show a WBC count of 7.2, Hct of 35.0, platelet count of 91,000, Cr of 1.1, TropT of 0.13, TCO2 of 26, glucose level of 121, and various other lab results. The differential shows neutrophils at 85.0%, lymphocytes at 10.0%, and eosinophils at 0.0%. 

Assessment and plan:
The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, pulseless arrest (unclear etiology), bradycardia (unclear etiology), hypothyroidism, and bacteremia. The plan includes weaning off the vent as tolerated, stopping antibiotics, monitoring for hemodynamic complications, assessing for cardiac injury, considering cardiac echo and neurological evaluation including head CT and EEG. The patient has a code status of DNR (do not resuscitate) and is to be kept in the ICU."

   Assessment and Plan
   RESPIRATORY FAILURE -- unclear precipitant.  Intubated for agonal
   breathing.  No evidence for pneumonia/ infection, sepsis, pulmonary
   embolism.  Possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or
   neurological event (CVA or seizure).  Unclear whether underlying lung
   disease.  Plan continue mechanical ventilation while awaiting final
   family decision regarding extubation and comfort care.
   PULSELESS ARREST -- Unclear whether related to precipitant for
   admission, or possibly related to induction and intubation event.
   Currently stabalized without further hemodynamic complications.
   Possible evolving sepsis.  Monitor.  Assess for cardiac injury.
   Consider cardiac echo.  Consider neurological evaluation including head
   CT and EEG.  No CPR.
   BRADYCARDIA
 unclear etiology, but possible related to hypothyroidism
   (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrisic cardiac
   conduction disease.  Plan check cardiac echo and TSH.
   HYPOTHYROIDISM
 TSH > 25.  [**Month (only) 11**] be contributing to bradycardia.
   Replace with iv synthroid.
   BACTEREMIA -- GPC from ER blood culture.  Continue Vancomycin
   DILATED RIGHT ATRIUM
 may represent right-side valvular heart disease
   or pulmonary hypertension.  Will check echo.
   HYPOTENSION -- unclear whether related to hypovolemia, underlying
   process prompting admission, or related to induction/intubation.
   Sepsis source may be bacteremia
 continue antimicrobials. Monitor BP,
   maintain MAP >60 mmHg.
   HYPOCALCEMIA -- Replete.  Monitor ionized Ca++.
   LACTIC ACID ELEVATION -- mild, likely hypoperfusion.  Resolving.
   Monitor abd exam for possible ischemia.  Monitor.
   LFT ELEVATION
 Resolving.  Unclear etiology.  Mild LFT elevation in
   recent past.  Possibly shock liver from hypotension.  No obvious
   pathology identified by abd CT, but need to await final
   interpretation).  Plan to trend serial LFTs, check amylase, lipase.
   Consider RUQ U/S.
   FLUIDS -- hypovolemia.  Improved with aggressive  iv repletion in ER.
   Monitor I/O

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure with unclear precipitant. The patient has been intubated and is receiving mechanical ventilation. The assessment suggests possible dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or neurological event (CVA or seizure). 

The patient also experienced a pulseless arrest, which is unclear whether it was related to the precipitant for admission or possibly related to induction and intubation event. The patient is currently stabilized without further hemodynamic complications, but there is a possibility of evolving sepsis. 

Additionally, the patient has bradycardia with unclear etiology, possibly related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. 

There are other medical complications mentioned in the note such as bacteremia, dilated right atrium, hypotension, hypocalcemia, lactic acid elevation, and LFT elevation. 

The patient's condition requires close monitoring and further evaluation with tests including cardiac echo, TSH, head CT, EEG, abdominal CT, RUQ U/S, serial LFTs, and trend of I/O."

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, pulseless arrest, bradycardia, hypothyroidism, and bacteremia. The patient remains intubated and sedated, unresponsive. He has been on mechanical ventilation with a Vt of 400 mL, RR of 12, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 50%, and ABG results are pending. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.1 C (96.9 F), heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 174/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's weight is currently 45 kg, with a fluid balance of -845 mL and a total fluid input of 2,315 mL. The patient has received various medications, including fentanyl and midazolam infusions, as well as antibiotics.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is unclear about the precipitant, but possible causes include dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or neurological event. The plan is to wean the patient off the vent as tolerated and stop antibiotics.
2. Pulseless Arrest: The cause of the pulseless arrest is unclear, possibly related to the admission event or intubation. The patient is currently stable without further complications, but there"

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of acute myocardial infarction and respiratory failure. The patient's vital signs are stable with a heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 174/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%, and assisted spontaneous breathing. 

The patient's fluid balance shows an intake of 2,315 mL and output of 3,160 mL over the past 24 hours, resulting in a negative balance of -845 mL. The patient's weight is currently 45 kg, which is slightly higher than the admission weight of 44.4 kg.

Laboratory results show a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, leukocyte count of 94 K/uL, sodium level of 67 mg/dL, potassium level of 4.4 mEq/L, glucose level of 121 mg/dL, and creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. Other lab values include elevated troponin T levels, increased lactate levels, elevated D-dimer levels, and abnormal liver function tests.

","Summary of the progress note:

The patient is currently in the ICU and remains intubated and sedated. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable with a temperature of 36.1°C, heart rate of 47 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 125/52 to 174/64 mmHg, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. The patient's weight remains unchanged at 45 kg. Fluid balance shows an input of 2,315 mL and output of 3,160 mL, resulting in a negative balance of -845 mL. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids, antibiotics (Piperacillin/Tazobactam), fentanyl, and midazolam. The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems remain unchanged except for the events mentioned above.

The patient's physical examination reveals clear lungs, bradycardia with a regular rhythm, benign abdomen, and no edema in the extremities. The patient's laboratory results show slightly elevated white blood cell count, decreased hematocrit, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges or show no significant abnormalities.

Assessment and plan:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for agonal breathing. There is no evidence of pneumonia, infection, or pulmonary embolism. Possible causes include dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely), or a"

   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]

   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn hypotension or low urine output
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco

   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.

   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, hypertension, hyponatremia, dementia, and COPD. She presented to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, leading to intubation. 

The patient has been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. There is no evidence of intrapulmonary process, and no new x-ray is available. The lung parenchyma appears normal with no ground glass opacity on CT chest or suggestion of overt pulmonary edema on CXR. Antibiotics have been discontinued.

The patient also has bradycardia, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output. Levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV has been initiated, and follow-up TSH is required.

Hypotension has been stable recently, possibly multifactorial in nature. Concern for sepsis exists due to lactate elevation and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs), but no leukocytosis, tachycardia, or fever is present. Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, and UTI. IVF boluses are given as needed for hypotension or low urine output.

Coagulopathy is present"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.

- The patient is a [age]-year-old [gender] admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath.
- On [date], the family planned to extubate the patient, but due to the patient becoming hypertensive, sedation was restarted and titrated up, resulting in normalization of blood pressure.
- The patient is currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam for pain and sedation management.
- The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.2°C (97.1°F), heart rate of 46 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 129/51 mmHg to 184/79 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%.
- The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a set tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 50%.
- The patient's physical examination reveals no abnormalities in the general appearance, heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities, or skin.
- Neurological examination shows that the patient is alert and oriented to time, place, and person, with intact cranial nerves and preserved sensation. Motor strength is 5/5"

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - dc vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   - limit sedation as much as possible
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn
   - check U/A, UCx
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to dc blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.
   .
   # Hypertension:
   - antihypertensives held as pressures are stable
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/c calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  Although they
   expressed wish for son to see patient, they do not wish to escalate
   care.  No pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  Once the central
   line is removed, the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.

","Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old female who has been admitted to the ICU. She remains intubated and on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure, with unclear precipitants. The patient's heart rate is low, indicating bradycardia, and there is evidence of hypothyroidism with a high TSH level. The patient's electrolyte levels and blood work show abnormalities, including low potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium. The patient has a history of multiple medical conditions and medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to breathe independently may lead to further complications, such as pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), due to prolonged intubation.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's slow heart rate can result in inadequate cardiac output and reduce blood flow to vital organs. It could be caused by hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease.

3. Hypothyroidism: The elevated TSH level indicates an underactive thyroid gland, which can contribute to the patient's bradycardia. If left untreated, hypothyroidism can lead to further complications, including cardiovascular problems and decreased metabolism.

4. Electrolyte Imbalance: The patient's labs show abnormalities in potassium, sodium, magnesium, and calcium levels. These imbalances can disrupt normal muscle and nerve function, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, muscle weakness, or other organ dysfunction.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU and has been intubated due to respiratory failure. The cause of respiratory failure is unclear, with possible causes including dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, neurological event, or underlying lung disease. The patient's vital signs show a low heart rate (bradycardia), and the etiology of bradycardia is also unclear but could be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is significantly elevated, indicating possible hypothyroidism.

Additionally, the patient has bacteremia, as indicated by the positive CNS from the ER blood culture. Antibiotics have been stopped, but it is unclear why. The patient's laboratory results show elevated levels of white blood cells (WBC), hematocrit (Hct), platelets (Plt), C-reactive protein (CRP), troponin-T, lactate, and D-dimer, among others. These findings suggest an inflammatory response and possible cardiac injury.

The patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits, with slightly low potassium (K+) and magnesium (Mg++). The patient's renal function is impaired, as indicated by the elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels.

The patient's nutritional status is being managed, and glycemic control is being monitored. The patient has multiple lines, including an 18"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU with multiple medical complications. The key points from the note include:

1. The patient has respiratory failure, unclear precipitant, and was intubated for agonal breathing. There is no evidence of pneumonia, infection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Possible causes include dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, neurological event (CVA or seizure), or underlying lung disease. The plan is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and stop antibiotics.

2. The patient experienced pulseless arrest, unclear whether related to the precipitant for admission or possibly related to the induction and intubation event. The patient is currently stable without further hemodynamic complications, but possible evolving sepsis should be monitored. Assessments for cardiac injury should be considered, including a cardiac echo. A neurological evaluation, including a head CT and EEG, may also be necessary. No CPR was performed.

3. The patient has bradycardia, unclear etiology, but possibly related to hypothyroidism (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass), or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. Follow-up is recommended, and consideration for replacing with iv synthroid is suggested.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is currently in the ICU with multiple medical complications. Here is a summary of the information:

- The patient remains on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The cause of this failure is unclear, but there are no signs of pneumonia, infection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Possible causes could be a dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest (less likely) or neurological event such as a stroke or seizure. The plan is to wean off the ventilator as tolerated and stop antibiotic therapy.

- The patient experienced a pulseless arrest, which is unclear whether it was related to the precipitant for admission or the induction and intubation event. The patient is currently stable without further hemodynamic complications, but there is a possibility of evolving sepsis. Monitoring is recommended along with assessing for cardiac injury. A cardiac echo and neurological evaluation, including a head CT and EEG, should be considered. No CPR was performed.

- The patient has bradycardia with an unclear etiology. It is possible that hypothyroidism (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass) or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease is causing the bradycardia. Following up is advised.

- The patient has hypothyroidism with a TSH level greater than 25. This may contribute to the bradycardia. It is recommended to replace with intravenous synthroid.

- The patient has bacteremia with"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and is currently intubated. Her condition has been stable on volume assist with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5. There are no new x-rays, but she has a history of bilateral effusions. The lung parenchyma appears normal without signs of pulmonary edema or ARDS. Antibiotics have been discontinued given the patient's CMO status. The patient's blood pressure is stable-hypertensive, but there is a concern for sepsis, sedative use, diminished kidney function, and cardiac dysfunction. Bradycardia is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Coagulopathy is suspected to be caused by DIC or liver dysfunction. The patient has renal failure with a baseline creatinine of 0.8, and her liver enzymes are elevated. Anemia and thrombocytopenia are present with a baseline HCT of 40. The patient has hypercholesterolemia and osteoporosis. Communication with the family regarding goals of care has been discussed, and the patient has made a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) decision.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory distress and intubation indicate a risk of ongoing respiratory failure."

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue discussion with family in regards to pt
s stated
   DNR/DNI status.
   - PS trial, wean sedation
   - d/ced vanc/zosyn
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  The
   patient remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.
   -continue levothyroxine 12.5 mg IV, will require f/u TSH
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Hypotension:  Has been stable recently.  This is likely
   multifactorial in setting of poor po intake, bradycardia, possible
   sepsis.  Concern for sepsis given lactate and bacteremia (GPC in
   clusters and pairs) but otherwise no leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   Possible sources of infection include empyema, pneumonia, UTI.
   - IVF boluses prn hypotension or low urine output
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, dc vanco
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - IVFs
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   -continue hold on monitoring as pt, family has decided to d/c blood
   draws
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.

   # Hypercholesterolemia:

   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  No pressors,
   transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been removed,
   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Will revisit DNR/DNI status today.  Plan to

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hyponatremia (formerly thought to be SIADH). She presented to the emergency department with lethargy and acute respiratory distress, leading to intubation.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient is stable on volume assist FiO2 50%, PEEP 5. There is no evidence of a profound intrapulmonary process, and bilateral effusions have been reported in the past. The lung parenchyma appears normal, with no ground glass opacity on CT chest or suggestion of overt pulmonary edema on CXR. Antibiotics have been discontinued.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output. Levothyroxine has been initiated at 12.5 mg IV, and follow-up TSH levels are required.

3. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is multifactorial, including poor oral intake, bradycardia, and possible sepsis. Sepsis may be indicated by elevated lactate and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs), but there are no signs of leukocytosis, tachycardia, or fever. Potential sources of infection include em"

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and dementia who presented to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with acute respiratory failure. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%. The patient's sedation level has been lightened, and she is responsive to commands.

Lab results show an elevated white blood cell count of 15.9 K/uL, slightly low hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL, elevated lactate level of 2.0 mmol/L, elevated D-dimer level of 2574 ng/mL, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's coagulation profile indicates a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) of 15.9 seconds, prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) of 35.4 seconds, and low platelet count of 91 K/uL. The patient's electrolytes are within normal limits.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with dementia and a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and COPD. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and has been intubated. The family is still deciding whether to terminate extubation, but they have decided to make the patient comfort measure-oriented (CMO) and not to wean her off the ventilator. The patient experienced profound bradycardia and hypotension in the morning, which improved after lightening sedation. The patient's urine output has been decreasing. The family is considering the patient's DNR/DNI status.

Medical Complications:
1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has a history of MI, which may have contributed to her current condition.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently stable on volume assist FiO2 50% and PEEP 5. Hypoventilation may be caused by deconditioning or sedation. There does not appear to be a profound intrapulmonary process.
3. Bradycardia: The patient likely has cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. She remains hemodynamically stable with adequate urine output.

","The patient is a 44-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction and respiratory failure. He was admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and management of his conditions. The patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure.

From the progress note, it is mentioned that the patient's urine output has been decreasing over the past 24 hours. The family is still deciding whether to extubate the patient or not, and they have decided to make him a comfort measure only (CMO) patient, meaning they do not want to terminate life-sustaining treatment but will not provide aggressive interventions either.

The patient experienced profound bradycardia and hypotension in the morning, which improved after lightening sedation. The patient has no known drug allergies and received Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn) on 08/15/2149 at 04:00 AM.

The patient is currently receiving fentanyl and midazolam infusions for pain and sedation management, respectively. Other ICU medications include famotidine, which was given on 08/16/2149 at 08:24 AM.

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the decreasing urine output. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2 C (98.9 F), heart rate of 90 bpm, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and"

   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,

   yesterday
   - continue current vent strategy
   - no abx at this time given CMO status
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   hold UOP monitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.

   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - holding IVFs, UOP, blood monitoring given CMO status

","Based on the provided information, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and previous cardiovascular events. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. 

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 147/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is sedated and nonresponsive.

The patient has been diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and is suspected to have had an acute pulmonary embolism (PE). She also has an elevated D-dimer level, which can indicate a possible PE. However, the recent echocardiogram shows mildly dilated right atrium (RA), but with a low Wells score at this time. 

The patient has several medical complications, including bradycardia, labile blood pressure, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute kidney injury (AKI), transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and hyperglycemia. 

The patient's current plan includes continuing with volume assist ventilation, maintaining a FiO2 of 40% and PEEP of 5. The decision to withhold antibiotics has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 45-year-old male admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, bradycardia, and hypothyroidism. He has been intubated for agonal breathing and is currently on mechanical ventilation. The cause of the respiratory failure is unclear, but possible causes include dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, neurological event, or underlying lung disease. The bradycardia is also of unclear etiology, but may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is elevated at >25, indicating hypothyroidism. The patient will be replaced with intravenous synthroid. The patient's code status is DNR (do not resuscitate).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure requires mechanical ventilation support. Complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury, and barotrauma.
2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia may be related to hypothyroidism or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. Complications that can arise include cardiac arrest, decreased cardiac output, and arrhythmias.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a critically ill individual in the ICU who is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. They have been experiencing respiratory failure with an unclear precipitant, and there is no evidence of pneumonia, infection, sepsis, or pulmonary embolism. Possible causes include dysrhythmia, cardiac arrest, neurological event (CVA or seizure), or underlying lung disease. The plan is to wean off the vent as tolerated and explore extubation with the family today.

The patient also has bradycardia with an unclear etiology, which could be related to hypothyroidism (hypothermia, bradycardia, thyroid mass) or intrinsic cardiac conduction disease. It is planned to follow up on this and replace thyroid hormone with intravenous synthroid.

Other findings include hypothyroidism with a TSH level > 25, which may be contributing to bradycardia. The patient has abnormal laboratory results including elevated WBC, Hct, Plt, Cr, Troponin-T, ALT/AST, Alk Phos/T Bili, D-dimer, LDH, Ca++, Mg++, and PO4 levels.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure could lead to complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), barotrauma, or lung injury due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's br"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 40%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue goal of care discussions with family.  Pt made CMO
   yesterday
   - continue current vent strategy
   - no abx at this time given CMO status
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   hold UOP monitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.
   .
   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - holding IVFs, UOP, blood monitoring given CMO status
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - crit stable following fem line removal
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line.

d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D

   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family.  No pressors,
   transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been removed,
   and the family understands that it may not be possible to obtain labs
   to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
s clinical
   status is deteriorating.  Pt made CMO yesterday ([**8-17**]), although family
   does not wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue discussion with

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia (previously thought to be SIADH). She was brought to the ED for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, resulting in intubation.

The patient has multiple medical complications and conditions, including:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient is diagnosed with an acute MI, specifically a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient initially presented with acute respiratory distress and required intubation. She is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5, indicating some degree of respiratory support. There is no evidence of profound intrapulmonary process, and previous x-rays showed bilateral effusions. The lung parenchyma appears normal, with no ground glass opacity on CT chest or suggestion of overt pulmonary edema on CXR. Antibiotics were initially started but have been discontinued due to the patient's choice to forgo aggressive care (CMO).

3. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate (48 bpm), which is likely attributed to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Sedative use may also contribute to the bradycardia. No active intervention is planned for this condition, as per the family's wishes not to escalate care.

","Summary:
The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, hypertension, and hyponatremia. She presented to the emergency department for lethargy and acute respiratory distress. She was intubated and diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, which is currently stable on volume assist with FiO2 40% and PEEP 5. The patient also has a history of COPD, hyperinflated lungs on CXR, and bilateral effusions. She is currently sedated and nonresponsive. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may worsen if there is hypoventilation or an underlying intrapulmonary process. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia could be due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. It is important to closely monitor the patient's heart rate and consider further evaluation and treatment if necessary.

3. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient's blood pressure has been stable-hypertensive recently but has a history of hypotension in the past. Factors such as poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished kidney function, and family wishes should be considered.

4. Coagulopathy: The patient's coagulopathy may be due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or liver dysfunction"

 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Current stable on volume assist FiO2 40%, PEEP
   5.  Hypoventilation may have been caused by deconditioning or sedation;
   there does not appear to be profound intrapulmonary process.  No new
   xray, but hx of bilateral effusions.  The lung parenchyma itself does
   not appear markedly abnormal --no ground glass opacity on CT chest, no
   suggestion of overt pulm edema on CXR, therefore will dc abx.  [**Month (only) 11**]
   consider PE given marked [**Last Name (un) **] (though prior ECGs show bilateral AE,
   recent echo shows mildly dilated RA), however low Well
s score at this
   time.  Has a history of COPD, hyperinflated on CXR.
   - will continue goal of care discussions with family.  Pt made CMO
   yesterday
   - continue current vent strategy
   - no abx at this time given CMO status
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   hold UOP monitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   .
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.

   # Acidemia:  Pt had a respiratory acidosis (?chronic as baseline bicarb
   seems to be high 30s) as well as a lactic acidosis.
   -continue holding monitoring for now given family wishes to d/c blood
   draws.
   .
   # ARF:  Baseline Cr is 0.8.  This is likely due to hypovolemia in the
   setting of poor po intake v. ATN from cardiac arrest.  Also was on
   levofloxacin as outpatient.  Had IV contrast for CT torso, so may
   worsen.
   - holding IVFs, UOP, blood monitoring given CMO status
   - renally dose meds, avoid nephrotoxins
   .
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest.
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   .
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.

","The patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, hyponatremia, and dementia. She was brought to the ED for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, and subsequently intubated. The patient has been diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), acute respiratory failure (not ARDS), and has a history of COPD. She also has hypoventilation, bradycardia, labile blood pressure, coagulopathy, acidemia, acute renal failure (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis, and communication issues.

Based on the provided information, potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's acute respiratory failure may progress if there are complications such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or worsening of COPD.

2. Cardiac Dysfunction: The patient's AMI and bradycardia indicate potential cardiac dysfunction. Further complications could include heart failure or arrhythmias.

3. Coagulopathy: The patient's elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, low HCT, and low fibrinogen suggest coagulopathy, which may lead to bleeding complications.

4. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): The patient's baseline creatinine level of 0.8 has worsened, indicating potential AKI."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, CVA, hypertension, and hyponatremia. She was admitted to the ICU due to lethargy, acute respiratory distress, and subsequent intubation. The patient has several medical complications that need to be addressed:

1. Myocardial Infarction (MI): The patient has been diagnosed with an acute MI. It is important to monitor her cardiac function and provide appropriate treatment.

2. Respiratory Failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation (MMV) due to apneic events. Her oxygen saturation is excellent, and she may be a candidate for extubation based on her performance on the ventilator. The plan is to switch the ventilator mode to PSV, lighten sedation, evaluate respiratory rate and tidal volume for the possibility of extubation.

3. Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, which is likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Limiting urine output monitoring and discontinuing levothyroxine are planned due to comfort measures only (CMO) status.

4. Labile Blood Pressure: The patient has stable-hypertensive blood pressure readings, which may be multifactorial due to poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished kidney function, and other factors. Pressors have been held given CMO status"

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   .
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt tolerated PSV for approx 7-8 hours
   yesterday, but overnight, experienced apneic events lasting 60 seconds
   long with desaturation into the 30%
s ([**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN report).  Apnea alarm was
   set at 60 seconds.  Currently trying to evaluate if patient is
   clinically eligible to be extubated.  No new xray, but hx of bilateral
   effusions.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5 as tolerated, lighten sedation, evaluate
   RISB and SBT for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.
   - plan to discuss with family about goals of care again this afternoon,
   after discussion yesterday they may be interested in hospice.
   - pt on CMO status, with the exception of IV fluids
   - cont. ipratropium/albuterol nebulizers for COPD
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   limit urine output moitoring at this time given CMO status
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -levothyroxine discontinued [**3-17**] CMO
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - GPC in clusters and chains likely a contaminant, holding abx given
   CMO
   - hold pressors given CMO status
   # Coagulopathy:  Etiology likely [**3-17**] DIC- elevated PTT, INR, low
   platelets, low HCT (baseline is 40), and low fibrinogen.  Liver
   dysfunction may also be possible etiology of coagulopathy.  No active
   bleeding after 2 units FFP and s/p removal of femoral line.
hold
   further blood draws given CMO status.
   # Acidemia
 resolved, however blood gas this morning 7.35.
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  [**Month (only) 11**] be from shock liver from cardiac arrest
 Stopped
   trending labs when d/c
d blood draws
   - liver enzymes were trending down, not currently monitoring
   - may be etiology of coagulopathy
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - T&S
   - will hold on following crits for now as pt is stable with poor access
   since removal of fem line, also CMO
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - d/c
d simvastatin for elevated LFTs
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D
   .
   # Communication: Discussed goals of care with family on [**8-17**].  No
   pressors, transcutaneous pacing, CPR, etc.  The central line has been
   removed,  and the family understands that it may not be possible to
   obtain labs to monitor the patient.  They understand that the patient
   clinical status is deteriorating.  Pt made CMO yesterday ([**8-17**]),
   although family does not wish to extubate at this time.  Will continue
   discussion with son [**Doctor Last Name 6971**] can be reached by phone: C - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6980**];
   H - [**Telephone/Fax (1) 6981**], and grandaughter (HCP), [**Name (NI) 6979**].  Family meeting
   planned for [**8-18**] to discuss possible extubation that is clinically
   indicated.  Will assess patient on PS with ABGs.

   Disposition: pending family decision for future care
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia. She was admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory distress and subsequent intubation. The patient's current condition is as follows:

- Respiratory failure: The patient experienced apneic events overnight, resulting in desaturation. Currently, the ventilator mode is set to CPAP/PSV, with a tidal volume of 400 mL and respiratory rate of 6 breaths per minute. The plan is to evaluate the patient's readiness for extubation based on clinical criteria.

- Bradycardia: The patient has a low heart rate, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Sedatives will be limited without compromising patient comfort, and levothyroxine has been discontinued.

- Labile BP: The patient has stable-hypertensive blood pressure readings, although there is a history of hypotension in the past. This could be attributed to poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function.

- Coagulopathy: The patient has elevated PTT, INR, low platelets, low HCT, and low fibrinogen levels, suggesting disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Liver dysfunction may also contribute to the coagulopathy. No active bleeding has occurred after 2 units of"

","Summary of the progress note:

- The patient is an 87-year-old Cantonese-speaking woman with dementia, a history of CVA, HTN, and hyponatremia. She was brought to the ED for lethargy and acute respiratory distress, resulting in intubation.
- The family has expressed limited care for the patient, and discussions about goals of care have been ongoing.
- The patient tolerated pressure support ventilation (PSV) for approximately 7-8 hours yesterday but experienced apneic events with desaturation overnight. The ventilator has been switched to mandatory minute volume (MMV).
- The patient's respiratory failure is ongoing, with plans to evaluate if she is clinically eligible for extubation based on respiratory indices and spontaneous breathing trial (SBT).
- Bradycardia is present, likely due to cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism. Limiting urine output monitoring is planned due to limited care goals.
- Medications such as levothyroxine have been discontinued per family wishes for limited care.
- The patient's labile blood pressure is stable but may be due to various factors like poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, and diminished kidney function. IV fluids will be given as needed.
- The patient's coagulopathy has resolved, as well as acidemia, acute kidney injury (ARF), transaminitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia."

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   The team has been speaking extensively to family members about goals of
   care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**].  While she is not comfort measures only, the
   family has expressed that they want limited care for the Mr. [**Known lastname 7156**].
   # Respiratory failure:  Pt tolerated PSV for approx 7-8 hours
   yesterday, but overnight, experienced apneic events lasting 60 seconds
   long with desaturation into the 30%
s ([**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN report).  Apnea alarm was
   set at 60 seconds.  Currently trying to evaluate if patient is
   clinically eligible to be extubated.  No new xray, but hx of bilateral
   effusions.
   - Switch ventilator to PS 5/5 as tolerated, lighten sedation, evaluate
   RISB and SBT for possibility of extubation on clinical criteria.
   - plan to discuss with family about goals of care again this afternoon,
   after discussion yesterday they may be interested in hospice.
   - pt currently on IV fluids only, will evaluate benefit of additional
   medications
   - nebs discontinued
   #Bradycardia: likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism.  Will
   limit urine output moitoring at this time given goal of limited care
   -limit sedatives without compromising patient comfort
   -levothyroxine discontinued due to limited care
   -family does not wish to escalate care: no pressors, transcutaneous
   pacing, atropine, etc.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - IV fluids as needed, abx and pressors not indicated at this time per
   discussions with family
   # Coagulopathy:  Resolved on today

   Assessment and Plan
 MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, ACUTE (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])
   87 yo Cantonese Speaking woman with dementia, h/o CVA, HTN,
   hyponatremia (thought [**3-17**] SIADH), who was brought to the ED by her
   family for lethargy, found to be in acute respiratory distress, and was
   intubated.
   The team has been speaking extensively to family members about goals of
   care for Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**].  While she is not comfort measures only, the
   family has expressed that they want limited care for the Mr. [**Known lastname 7156**].
   The patient was extubated yesterday without event and is planned to be
   discharged home on hospice.
   # Respiratory failure:  Resolved, Pt extubated yesterday without
   event.  No oxygen requirement.  Will plan to send home to hospice today
   with morphine/ativan for respiratory distress.
   #Bradycardia:  - resolved. likely [**3-17**] cardiac dysfunction and
   hypothyroidism.
   # Labile BP:  Has been stable-hypertensive recently, although hx of
   hypotension in the past.  This is likely multifactorial in setting of
   poor po intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished
   kidney function.  There was initial concern for sepsis given lactate
   and bacteremia (GPC in clusters and pairs) but otherwise no
   leukocytosis, tachycardia, fever.
   - patient to be discharged to hospice, do not plan to monitor at home
   as will be in hospice care.
   # Coagulopathy:  Resolved on yesterday
s [**Month/Day (2) **]. No new lab draws to
   evaluate.
   # Acidemia
 resolved. No new [**Month/Day (2) **] today
   # ARF:  resolved
   # Transaminitis:  liver enzymes normalizing from likely shock liver
   after cardiac arrest
   - if we draw future [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) 116**] monitor
   # Anemia/Thrombocytopenia:  Baseline HCT is 40.
   - no new [**First Name3 (LF) **] this am, sending home for hospice
   .
   # Hypercholesterolemia:
   - will not restart medications due to discharge home to hospice and
   intent for comfot care only
   .
   # Osteoporosis: d/ced calcium, vitamin D, will not restart on discharge
   as going to hospice
   .
   # Communication: Pt was extuabated and through discussions with family,
   plan is to send Mrs. [**Known lastname 7156**] home with hospice care.  Outpatient meds
   will not be restarted, with Morphine elixir and Ativan the only meds
   for use at home for comfort.

   Disposition: Discharge to home with hospice
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 87-year-old woman with a history of dementia, previous cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hypertension, and hyponatremia (previously thought to be SIADH). She was admitted to the ICU for acute respiratory distress and required intubation. The patient's family has expressed that they want limited care for her.

The patient has been weaned off invasive ventilation and successfully extubated without any complications. The plan is to discharge her home to hospice care with morphine elixir and ativan for respiratory distress.

The potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Respiratory failure: Although the patient has resolved acute respiratory failure and has been extubated, there is still a risk of respiratory distress at home, especially with limited care and the use of morphine, which can depress respiratory drive.

2. Bradycardia: The patient's bradycardia has resolved, but given her history of cardiac dysfunction and hypothyroidism, there is a possibility of recurrence.

3. Labile blood pressure: The patient's labile blood pressure is attributed to various factors such as poor oral intake, bradycardia, possible sepsis, sedative use, diminished kidney function, and cardiac dysfunction. It is important to monitor her blood pressure closely during the discharge to hospice.

4. Coagulopathy: Although the patient's coagulopathy has resolved, it"
