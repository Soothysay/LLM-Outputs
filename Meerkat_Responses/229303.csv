   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 72-year-old male with a chief complaint of hypoxemia. He was admitted with abdominal pain and found to have a left kidney stone with edema and stranding of the kidney on CT. He received morphine and dilaudid for pain management and was given IV fluids (IVF) and lasix, which helped. However, he developed new dyspnea in the evening, with oxygen saturation at 85% on 3 liters of nasal cannula. He was given lasix again with good urine output. 

The patient was transferred to the ICU and placed on BiPAP due to persistent dyspnea. He continues to complain of abdominal pain and dyspnea, which is now mild. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease (CAD), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) in the setting of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, an ejection fraction (EF) of 40%, chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) with baseline creatinine levels of 1.4-6, a previous GI bleed, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), emphysema, and atrial fibrillation (AF). 

Review of systems reveals respiratory symptoms including dyspnea, and gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain. 

Flowsheet data shows vital signs such as temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure within normal ranges, but with a low oxygen saturation"

   Assessment and Plan
   71 M w/ pmh of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), CAD, OSA, HTN,
   CKD, 40 pack year smoking history admitted w/ flank pain, found to have
   kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure, being transferred to
   the MICU for hypoxia.
   .
   # Hypoxia: Patient with new O2 requirement, now O2 sat between 85 and
   90% on 5L nc. Differential includes aspiration event, PE, MI, vs fluid
   overload. No witnessed aspiration event. No clear infiltrate on CXR. No
   CP, but will rule out MI. PE unlikely given that the patient is
   therapeutic on coumadin. Patient also has 40 pack year smoking history
   and ?diagnosis of emphysema. Will tolerate O2 sats in low 90s. Given
   that patient has received continue IVFs over 1.5 days for
   nephrolithiasis, fluid overload is most likely, and most consistent
   with CXR.
   -FU repeat CXR in AM
   - I/Os goal -1L today.
   -cycle CEs
   -obtain EKG
   -continue home CPAP settings for OSA
   #) Kidney Stone: Patient's first kidney stone, risk factors include
   obseity, HTN and patient with history of thyroidectomy for medullary ca
   so on calcitriol. Renal function at baseline (Cr 1.4-1.7), 2.3 on
   admission, now 2.7. Patient has good urine output. This could
   potentially be secondary to stone. Urology was reportedly consulted in
   ED, though no note in chart or OMR.
   -Hold IV fluids given new hypoxia
   -continue Flomax and lasix
   -Dilaudid for Pain control
   -Zofran for nausea
   -strain urine
   -Ceftriaxone for possible infected stone given perinephric stranding
   WBC count with neutrophillic predominence
   -Consider reconsulting given worsening renal failure despite 2 days IV
   fluids, and now diuresis
   - renally dose meds
   - avoid nephro-toxins
   - hold lisinopril
   - repeat Cr in AM.
   - f/u CT abdomen to look for hydronephrosis
   - send urine lytes
   .
   # Acute on Chronic Renal Disease: Unclear etiology of Chronic Disease.
   Acute change in function may be secondary to obstructing stone. However
   no clear evidence of hydroureter.
   .
   #) HTN:
   -continue amlodipine, metoprolol
   -hold lisinopril for ARF
   .
   #) Atrial fibrillation: rate controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic
   on coumadin. INR 2.7.
   - hold coumadin in anticipation of potential urologic procedure if
   continues to have worsening renal failure
   -continue metoprolol
   -daily INR
   .
   #) Chronic systolic heart failure: [**1-20**] non-ischemic cardiomyopathy w/
   EF 40%. Appears mildly hypervolemic.
   - continue b-blocker,
   -continue lasix

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a 40 pack year smoking history.
- He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure.
- The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxia and is being treated with Lorazepam and Hydromorphone.
- His vital signs include a temperature of 36.6 C (97.8 F), heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 127/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on BiPAP.
- The patient has atrial fibrillation and is being managed with metoprolol and therapeutic dosing of Coumadin.
- He has a history of thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma and is on levothyroxine.
- The patient also has a history of depression and is on fluoxetine and trazodone as needed.
- Imaging shows a left mid ureteral stone measuring 2.5mm and left perinephric stranding, indicating possible kidney stone-related complications.
- The patient's renal function has worsened, with creatinine levels increasing from 1.4-1.7 to 2.7.
- The patient is receiving IV fluids,"

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a 40 pack-year smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. He is being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C (97.8°F), heart rate of 72 bpm with atrial fibrillation, blood pressure ranging from 127/61 mmHg to 152/63 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on Bipap mask.

The patient's physical examination reveals bilateral lower lobe rales without wheezing, irregularly irregular heart rhythm with no murmurs/rubs/gallops, supple neck with a jugular venous pressure (JVP) of 10 cm, and no neurologic deficits.

Lab results show elevated levels of creatinine (2.7), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (40), potassium (11.9), and troponin T (0.03) with a mildly elevated CK-MB. The INR is"

   CP, but will rule out MI. PE unlikely given that the patient is
   therapeutic on coumadin. Patient also has 40 pack year smoking history
   and ?diagnosis of emphysema. Will tolerate O2 sats in low 90s. Given
   that patient has received continue IVFs over 1.5 days for

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a significant smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and was found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the ICU for hypoxia, with an oxygen saturation between 85-90% on 5 liters of nasal cannula. The differential diagnosis for hypoxia includes aspiration event, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, and fluid overload. The patient has received continuous intravenous fluids over the past 1.5 days for nephrolithiasis, which may contribute to fluid overload. A repeat chest X-ray is planned in the morning. The patient is also on CPAP settings for obstructive sleep apnea.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Hypoxia: The most likely cause of hypoxia is fluid overload due to the continuous IV fluids received for nephrolithiasis. The plan includes repeating the chest X-ray in the morning, administering 60mg of IV lasix at 4am, aiming for a negative fluid balance of 1 liter, and continuing home CPAP settings for OSA.
2. Kidney Stone: The patient's first kidney stone is likely secondary to obesity, hypertension, and a history of thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma. Renal function"

He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the MICU for hypoxia.

The patient's current condition includes fluid overload, which has improved with IV Lasix. He is stable on 6L NC and his chest x-ray shows minimal improvement in volume status. Cardiac enzymes are flat. The plan is to repeat the CXR in the morning, continue home CPAP settings for OSA at night, and continue Lasix 40mg IV.

The patient also has a kidney stone, which is his first one. Risk factors include obesity, hypertension, and a history of thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma, so he is on calcitriol. His renal function at baseline was within normal range (Cr 1.4-1.7), but it increased to 2.3 on admission and now 3.2. The patient has good urine output, and a renal ultrasound showed mild fullness of the left kidney without hydronephrosis. The plan is to continue Flo max and Lasix, give Dilaudid for pain control, Zofran for nausea, strain urine, and ceftriaxone for a possible infected stone given perinephric stranding and WBC count with neutrophillic predominence.

The patient also has acute on chronic renal disease, possibly secondary to poor forward flow. However, no clear evidence of hydroureter was seen. The FeUrea is 53%, pointing toward intrinsic etiology. The plan is to repeat creatinine this afternoon, renally dose medications, avoid nephrotoxins, hold lisinopril, and repeat Cr in AM.

The patient also has atrial fibrillation, which is rate-controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic on coumadin. INR is 2.7. The plan is to hold coumadin given supratherapeutic INR, restart when low therapeutic range, continue metoprolol, and have daily INR.

The patient also has chronic systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction of 40%. He appears mildly hypervolemic. The plan is to continue b-blocker, continue Lasix, and hold lisinopril.

The patient also has obstructive sleep apnea, and the plan is to continue CPAP. He has a history of peptic ulcer disease/gastritis, so he will continue PPI. He has a history of thyroidectomy and will continue levothyroxine. He has a history of parathyroidectomy and will continue calcitriol. He also has depression and will continue fluoxetine and trazodone prn.

The patient's prophylaxis includes P"

   Chief Complaint: Fluid Overload secondary to IVF, Nephrolithiasis
   24 Hour Events:
   - Renal consult - they also think likely pre-renal (forward flow) v.
   renal vascular disease.  [**Month (only) 60**] consider Doppler study in future. They
   were not impressed by 2.5 mm stone. Urine Eos negative. Diuresed
   aggressively (3.3 L - want to check creatinine before diuresing more -
   if stable then continue diuresis in a.m.).  Complement levels pending.
   - UA shows blood - maybe due to stone. Repeat.
   - Was anxious on BiPAP this a.m. - gave ativan.  Did well on trial off
   BiPAP, but back on again now.

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a significant smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. The patient is currently in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for hypoxia.

The patient's current conditions and potential medical complications include:

1. Hypoxia: The patient is experiencing low oxygen levels, which could be due to fluid overload. The administration of IV lasix has improved his oxygen saturation.

2. Kidney Stone: The patient's first kidney stone has been identified, and risk factors include obesity, HTN, and a history of thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma. The patient's renal function has deteriorated from baseline, with a creatinine level of 2.3 on admission and now 2.7. This could potentially be secondary to the stone. A urology consult has been scheduled.

3. Acute on Chronic Renal Disease: The cause of the chronic renal disease is unclear, but the acute change in renal function may be secondary to the obstructing stone. However, no clear evidence of hydronephrosis is seen. Renal ultrasound and urine electrolytes are pending.

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a medical history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (EF 40%), coronary artery disease (CAD), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), hypertension (HTN), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a significant smoking history. He was admitted with flank pain and found to have a kidney stone and acute on chronic renal failure. He is being transferred to the MICU for hypoxia. The patient's current condition includes fluid overload, abdominal pain, kidney stone, and acute on chronic renal failure. He is currently receiving IV lasix for fluid overload and has shown improvement in oxygen saturation. His cardiac enzymes are flat, indicating no ongoing myocardial injury. The patient is tolerating a normal diet and has minimal epigastric tenderness. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient's low oxygen saturation may indicate inadequate oxygenation of tissues, potentially leading to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Fluid overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance, indicating ongoing fluid removal. However, the presence of bilateral basilar rales and a JVP of 10cm suggest fluid overload, which can lead to pulmonary edema and cardiac dysfunction.
3. Abdominal pain: The patient's ongoing abdominal pain could be secondary to the kidney stone, but the presence of constipation and epigastric tenderness raises concern for other causes such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's worsening renal function indicated by increased creatinine levels suggests an acute deterioration on top of pre-existing chronic kidney disease. This can lead to further kidney damage and complications such as fluid overload and electrolyte imbalances.
5. Kidney stone: The patient's first kidney stone, along with risk factors like obesity, HTN, and a history of thyroidectomy for medullary carcinoma, increases the risk of recurrent kidney stones. Complications such as urinary tract infections or hydronephrosis may occur if the stone obstructs the urinary tract.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient is rate-controlled on metoprolol and therapeutic on coumadin. However, the supratherapeutic INR indicates a need to restart coumadin when low therapeutic range is achieved. The patient is at risk for thromboembolic events due to atrial fibrillation.
7. Chronic systolic heart failure: The patient's non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 40% indicates chronic systolic heart failure. The patient appears mildly hypervolemic, and the use of diuretics like lasix is appropriate. However, the patient's cardiac function should be closely monitored for further deterioration.
8. OSA: The patient's history of OSA requires ongoing use of CPAP therapy to maintain airway patency and improve oxygenation.
9. Other comorbidities: The patient has a history of peptic"
