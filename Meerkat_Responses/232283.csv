","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, type 2 diabetes, seizure disorder, and altered mental status. He was admitted with symptoms of altered mental status due to seizures, sigmoid volvulus, and pneumonia.

The patient underwent decompression of the sigmoid volvulus with flex sigmoidoscopy. He is currently on IV fluids and NPO status. The plan is to monitor his potassium levels and replete as needed to prevent metabolic ileus. The medical team will notify the gastroenterology and surgery teams if any clinical changes occur.

The patient initially presented with mental status changes, and a code stroke was called. However, nystagmus and EEG results indicated seizures, and he was loaded with dilantin. The mental status has improved but is still not back to baseline. Possible reasons for the mental status changes include urinary tract infection (UTI), pneumonia, and a post-ictal state. Cardiac enzymes were negative twice.

Treatment for the infectious etiology will continue with Vancomycin and Cefepime. Seizure management will also continue with Dilantin, and the neurology team will be consulted. It is important to determine the patient's baseline mental status from the family.

The patient has a history of seizures, which could be triggered by previous strokes. Dilantin IV has been initiated per neurology recommendations. Dilantin levels will be monitored, and the"

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, seizure disorder, admitted with altered mental status due to seizures, sigmoid volvulus, and pneumonia. He has been treated for various medical conditions, including mental status changes, seizures, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, deep vein thrombosis, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Sigmoid volvulus: The patient's sigmoid volvulus has already been decompressed with flex sigmoidoscopy. However, there is a risk of recurrence or complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.

2. Pneumonia: The patient's pneumonia is likely secondary to aspiration due to baseline dysphagia and recent seizure activity. There is a risk of worsening respiratory status and the need for mechanical ventilation.

3. Seizures: The patient's seizure disorder needs ongoing management, and there is a risk of recurrent seizures.

4. Urinary tract infection: The patient's urine is growing E. coli, and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be continued. There is a risk of worsening infection or kidney involvement.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is mildly elevated, and aggressive antihypertensive regimens may not be recommended due to poor IV access. There is a risk of complications related to uncontrolled hypertension.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 60-year-old male with a history of stroke, hypertension, and altered mental status. He is currently admitted to the ICU for large bowel obstruction, including volvulus and adhesions. The patient is on broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected UTI and pneumonia. He is also being treated for sleep apnea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Large bowel obstruction: The patient has a confirmed large bowel obstruction, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications such as bowel ischemia or perforation.
2. Aspiration pneumonia: Due to the patient's altered mental status and high risk of aspiration, there is a possibility of developing aspiration pneumonia. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to minimize this risk.
3. UTI: The presence of E. coli in the urine suggests a urinary tract infection. The patient's antibiotic regimen should be adjusted based on the culture data to ensure effective treatment.
4. Sleep apnea: The patient's nocturnal desaturations are consistent with sleep apnea. Continuous monitoring and consideration for an outpatient sleep study once discharged and stable should be planned.
5. Hypertension: Although the patient's hypertension is described as benign, it is important to monitor his blood pressure regularly and resume oral medications as appropriate.
6. Seizure activity: The patient is on Dilation for seizure activity, and it is crucial to ensure adequate seizure control to prevent any potential complications related to seizures.

   # Sigmoid volvulus. Pt found to have volvulus on [**3-10**] and underwent
   flex sig for decompression.  Per report it was successful, however
   repeat KUB showed unchanged volvulus.  Unclear as to whether
   decompression failed or reoccured. Had repeat decompression on arrival
   to ICU however no improvement on KUB
   - D/W surgery; plan for OR today
   - IVFs, NPO
   - NGT to suction
   - serial abd exams
   - trend lactate
   - Start BB perioperatively
   - Of note, pt has elevated PTT; d/c heparin SC given going to OR;
   recheck PTT
   -ECHO today for pre op eval

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, seizure disorder, and previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke). He was admitted with altered mental status due to seizures, sigmoid volvulus, and pneumonia. 

Medical Complications:

1. Sigmoid Volvulus: The patient has recurrent sigmoid volvulus, which is causing a large bowel obstruction. Despite undergoing flex sigmoidoscopy for decompression, the volvulus persisted. The patient is scheduled for surgery today to address this issue.

2. Pneumonia: The patient has pneumonia, likely secondary to aspiration due to dysphagia and recent seizure activity. He was started on vancomycin and will be transitioned to cefepime once the sputum culture results are available.

3. Urinary Tract Infection (UTI): The patient's urine culture grew E. coli, which is being treated with the current antibiotics covering pneumonia and UTI.

4. Hypernatremia: The patient has hypernatremia, likely due to poor oral intake while being NPO for the volvulus and receiving d5 NS fluids. The sodium level should be trended and maintained with d5 half-normal saline fluids.

5. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure is mildly elevated, and aggressive antihypertensive regimens are being avoided. Hydralazine IV is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, seizure disorder, and previous cerebrovascular accident (stroke).
- He was admitted with altered mental status due to seizures, sigmoid volvulus, and pneumonia.
- The patient underwent a flexible sigmoidoscopy for decompression of the volvulus but had a recurrence.
- Surgical evaluation recommended non-operative management initially, with plans for repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy tonight. If unsuccessful, surgery may be necessary.
- The patient has an elevated white blood cell count, likely secondary to the infection.
- He is currently being treated for pneumonia and urinary tract infection.
- His sodium levels are elevated, possibly due to poor oral intake and intravenous fluids.
- Blood cultures have been drawn, and repeat chest X-rays will be performed in the morning.
- The patient's seizures are being managed with Dilantin, and seizure precautions are in place.
- His type 2 diabetes medication has been discontinued due to poor oral intake.
- Other medical conditions include congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Large bowel obstruction (volvulus): The patient has recurrent sigmoid volvulus, which can lead to further complications if not managed appropriately.
2. Pneumonia: The patient has an existing lung infection, which may worsen if not treated adequately.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient's progress note indicates that they have been in the ICU for an unknown duration. The patient has a history of hypertension, seizure, large bowel obstruction (volvulus), cerebrovascular accident (stroke), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They are currently on multiple medications including antibiotics, antiepileptics, blood pressure medications, and prophylactic treatments for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 64 bpm, blood pressure of 154/68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on a nasal cannula. The patient is alert and oriented, with no acute distress observed during the physical examination. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count and platelet count, but within normal range for hemoglobin, creatinine, and electrolytes. Imaging reveals a persistent sigmoid volvulus and clear chest X-ray. Microbiology results indicate the presence of gram-positive rods in sputum and pan-sensitive E. coli in urine. The assessment and plan include ongoing management of hypertension, seizure disorder, large bowel obstruction, and pneumonia/urinary tract infection. The patient is expected to undergo surgery for definitive treatment of the large bowel obstruction and will receive preoperative beta-blocker therapy.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERTENSION, BENIGN: continues to be elevated, starting bblocker,
   start standing low dose hydralazine.
 SEIZURE, WITHOUT STATUS EPILEPTICUS: on dilantin.
 LARGE BOWEL OBSTRUCTION (INTESTINAL OBSTRUCTION, INCLUDING VOLVULUS,
   ADHESIONS): Will need surgery for definitive therapy. PTT prolonged
   currently  likely [**3-14**] to s/c heparin may hold off surgery. For now will
   keep NPO and hold heparin. Will connect NG to LWS. Will start preop
   bblockade given history of CAD with lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **]. Will obtain
   echo.
 .H/O CVA (STROKE, CEREBRAL INFARCTION), ISCHEMIC : on stable aspirin.
? pneumonia/UTI: cefepime x8days for HAP/UTI/aspiration.

   Attending Note: I saw and examined the patient, and was physically
   present with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 9018**] for the key portions of the services provided.
   I agree with the note above, including the assessment and plan. I would
   emphasize and add the following points:
   86M HTN, CAD, HLD, DM, CVAs admitted to neurology from NH [**3-9**] with
   facial droop/slurred speech found to be seizing, now controlled on
   Dilantin. Hospital course has been notable for pan s E Coli UTI,
   possible asp pna on vanco/cefepime (Day 3), and abd distension with
   recurrent sigmoid volvulus. He is s/p decompression flex sig on [**3-10**]
   but continues to have radiographic evidence of volvulus and was
   transferred back to MICU for repeat attempt at decompression flex sig.
   GI and surgery following.
   Exam as above. Awake, no resp distress, S1S2 regular, Abdomen soft,
   nontender.
   PTT 91, INR 1.1, Hct 33.5
   Flex sig today did not reveal a volvulus. Rectal tube was inserted for
   decompression.
   Impression
 large bowel obstruction, will likely need surgery for
   definitive therapy. Prolonged PTT may be due to s/c heparin. For now
   will keep NPO and hold heparin. Agree with NG at LWS, cefepime x 8 days
   for HAP/aspiration, beta blocker given history of CAD with lopressor
   12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. Echo pending. Will transfer to surgical service tonight.
   Time 38 minutes.

","The patient is an 86-year-old male with a history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and previous strokes. He was admitted to the neurology service from a nursing home with facial droop and slurred speech, and was found to be seizing. His hospital course has been notable for a pan-sensitive E. coli urinary tract infection, possible aspiration pneumonia on vancomycin and cefepime (Day 3), and abdominal distension with recurrent sigmoid volvulus. He underwent decompression flexible sigmoidoscopy on [**3-10**] but continues to have radiographic evidence of volvulus, and was transferred back to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) for repeat attempt at decompression flexible sigmoidoscopy. He is currently awake, not in respiratory distress, with regular heart sounds, and a soft, non-tender abdomen. His PTT is prolonged at 91, and his INR is 1.1. The flexible sigmoidoscopy today did not reveal a volvulus, and a rectal tube was inserted for decompression. The impression is large bowel obstruction, which will likely require surgery for definitive therapy. The prolonged PTT may be due to subcutaneous heparin. For now, the patient will be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) and heparin will be held. The plan includes placing a nasogastric tube to low wall suction, continuing cefepime"
