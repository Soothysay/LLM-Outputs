   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo woman with metastic breast cancer to bone, admitted with
   displaced fracture of the clavicle, with Staph aureus in her blood and
   urine (MSSA) and resolving neutrapenia
   .
   # respiratory failure: multifactorial, with contributions from
   restrictive lung disease on the basis of kyphoscoliosis, recent
   increase in narcotic use, and likely sepsis; pt was in marked
   respiratory distress and fatiguing on arrival in the ICU, so intubated.
   Titrate narcotics back to home/minimal effective doses and wean vent as
   tolerates.
   - tolerating pressure support well, but with elevated RISBI this AM.
   Attempt to wean the vent as tolerated.
   .
   # delirium: possibly secondary to narcotics, infection; must also
   consider CNS metastases or infection, as pt has been on steroids. will
   check head CT to rule out ICH, but will need head MRI to fully rule out
   new mets
   - CT head -> w/o acute process but with mets to calvarium.
   - f/u MRI of brain done this AM.
   - Mental status improving, continue to follow.
   - consider LP, but pt has been on abx x >48 hrs
   .
   # bacteremia/septicemia - Staph aureus, sensitivities of blood cultures
   pending but urine culture of staph aureus was sensitive to oxacillin,
   so switched from vancomycin to nafcillin for bactericidal [**Doctor Last Name **].
   - needs MRI of L spine to eval for epidural abscess
   - stress dose steroids, as has been on slow decadron taper
   - will also need echo to eval for endocarditis
   .
   # neutropenia: Cycle 3 of doxil on [**4-14**]. ANC 1280 today but spiking
   fevers; continue neutropenic precautions and cefepime.
   - ANC rising
   .
   # Breast cancer: - further chemo per heme/onc, multiple mets as per
   head CT.
   .
   # pain control - fentanyl patch, gabapentin
   - sling, ortho following for fractures
   .
   #Low UOP: Bolus this AM, and then start maintenence fluids.
   .
   # precautions: pneumoboots, bowel regimen, sc heparin

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer to the bone, admitted with a displaced fracture of the clavicle. She has Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and urinary tract infection (MSSA), resolving neutropenia. The patient is experiencing respiratory failure due to restrictive lung disease from kyphoscoliosis, increased narcotic use, and sepsis. She was intubated due to marked respiratory distress and fatigue. The patient is also showing signs of delirium, possibly secondary to narcotics, infection, CNS metastases, or infection. An MRI of the brain is planned to rule out new metastases. The patient has bacteremia/septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, and the sensitivity of blood cultures is pending. She is being treated with nafcillin, and further evaluation for an epidural abscess in the lumbar spine is needed. Stress dose steroids are required due to the slow taper of decadron. An echo is also needed to evaluate for endocarditis. The patient has neutropenia, and further chemotherapy for breast cancer with multiple metastases is planned. Pain control measures include a fentanyl patch and gabapentin. The patient is on low output, and precautions such as pneumoboots, bowel regimen, and sc heparin are in place. She has central line access and is currently in the ICU."

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer to the bone. She was admitted with a displaced fracture of the clavicle and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The patient also has respiratory failure due to multifactorial causes, delirium possibly secondary to narcotics, infection, CNS metastases, or infection, and bacteremia/septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus. She is currently on antibiotics, including gentamicin, cefepime, and nafcillin, and has an MRI of the lumbar spine planned to evaluate for epidural abscess. The patient also needs an echo to evaluate for endocarditis. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her compromised immune system from chemotherapy and prolonged use of invasive lines and devices.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient's respiratory distress and fatigue may worsen, requiring continued ventilatory support and careful titration of narcotics to minimize respiratory depression.
3. Delirium: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen due to ongoing infection, narcotics, CNS metastases, or other factors. Close monitoring and appropriate interventions are necessary to manage this condition.
4. Bacteremia/septicemia: Although the patient is currently receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is a risk of ongoing or recurrent bacteremia/septicemia. Monitoring of vital signs,"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER-positive breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She has been treated with Doxil and received steroid therapy after spine radiation. The patient also experienced a fall at home last week and is currently on intravenous antibiotics for GPC bacteremia.

Upon admission, the patient presented with right shoulder pain (fracture in distal and mid-clavicle), generalized weakness, tachycardia (120s), and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status, which are likely due to sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and possible medication effect.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her central venous pressure (CVP) is 9 mmHg, and she has received 4,623 mL of IV fluids since midnight. The patient's blood products include 2 units of packed red blood cells transfused.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER+ breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She has recently undergone treatment with Doxil and is currently on a steroid taper following spine radiation. The patient was admitted with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status, which are likely due to sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and possible medication effects.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, mssa bacteremia, and respiratory failure. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs include a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 40% FiO2. Her laboratory results show leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

The patient's physical examination reveals kyphosis, absent peripheral pulses in the right lower extremity, and distended abdomen. She is sedated and follows simple commands. Imaging studies show a very rotated chest X-ray and no evidence of pneumonia. Microbiology tests indicate bacteremia with Staphylococcus aureus.

The assessment and plan include the following:
1. Hypotension - likely sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and possible medication effect.
2. MSSA"

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER+ breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She was recently treated with the third cycle of Doxil and is on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient also had a fall at home last week and is currently on intravenous antibiotics for GPC bacteremia (coag + staph in blood and urine on 4/30). She was admitted with right shoulder pain (4/30 x-ray fracture in distal and mid-clavicle), generalized weakness, tachycardia (120s) and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence, which is likely due to sepsis and medication.

The patient has several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

1. Hypotension: The patient's low blood pressure may be a result of sepsis and medication. It is important to monitor her CVP (central venous pressure) and provide supportive care, such as IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics.

2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has a bloodstream infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). She requires ongoing evaluation for the source of infection and continued antibiotic coverage with nafcillin.

3. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Her RSBI (rapid shallow breathing index) indicates the need"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver. She has been treated with Doxil and received steroid tapering after spine radiation. The patient was admitted with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She is now in the ICU due to hypotension and altered mental status, likely due to sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and possible medication effect. The patient's current vital signs include a heart rate of 93 bpm, blood pressure of 115/71 mmHg, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. She is sedated and on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory system compliance of 27.4 mL/cmH2O. The patient's laboratory results show leukocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Imaging and microbiology results are also provided. 

The patient's assessment includes hypotension, likely due to sepsis and medication effect. She has MSSA bacteremia, and the source of infection is being evaluated. The patient is also somnolent, possibly due to narcotics or infection, and her mental status is improving. She has respiratory failure, but oxygenation is good, and consideration is being given to extubation pending a positive pressure trial and respiratory system compliance index (RSBI) value.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock and bacteremia. The patient has been admitted to the ICU and is currently being treated for several medical conditions.

1. Hypotension: The patient's hypotension is being managed by maintaining a central venous pressure (CVP) above 12 and using pressors to keep the mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60. Nafcillin has been continued as it is effective against MSSA bacteremia.

2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin. A transthoracic echo (TTE) has been ordered to rule out vegetations, and an MRI of the spine has been performed to check for spinal osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. Surveillance cultures will be done until they are negative, and the patient's microfloxacin will be followed up.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is believed to be due to a narcotic overdose, as she responded well to narcan. An MRI of the brain has been performed, which showed no new brain metastases. The patient should be monitored carefully for narcotics, and a lumbar puncture (LP) may be considered if she does not improve.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient required intubation for respiratory distress upon admission to the ICU. She is"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock and bacteremia. She has been in the ICU since admission and is currently intubated for respiratory distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure of 125/73 mmHg and a heart rate of 84 bpm. Her oxygen saturation is 95% on CPAP/PSV with FiO2 of 40%. The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia with a WBC count of 2.1 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 111 K/uL, and normal kidney function with a creatinine level of 0.2 mg/dL. Imaging studies, including MRI of the spine and brain, have shown no evidence of osteomyelitis, abscess, or brain metastases. The patient has a positive blood culture for coag + staph bacteremia, but negative urine and sputum cultures. The patient's condition is complicated by hypotension, MSSA bacteremia, altered mental status possibly due to narcotic overdose, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and PCP infection in the sputum.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is maintained at goal with IV fluids and nafcillin therapy. Pressors may be required to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) >60 mmHg.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing bacteremia with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Nafcillin therapy should be continued, and surveillance cultures should be obtained until negative x2.
3. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status may be due to narcotic overdose. Narcotics should be used cautiously, and naloxone (Narcan) should be administered if necessary. Further investigation, such as a lumbar puncture (LP), may be needed if the patient does not improve.
4. Respiratory Failure: The patient requires mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. Ventilator settings should be optimized, and attempts to wean pressure support should be made today.
5. PCP Infection: The patient has PCP infection in the sputum. Bactrim therapy should be initiated.
6. Pain Management: The patient should be managed with fentanyl patch and prn fentanyl for pain control.
7. Breast Cancer: The patient's breast cancer should be managed in consultation with the oncology team.
8. Clavicular Fracture: The patient has a clavicular fracture, which should be managed with a sling and pain control.
9. Glycemic Control: The patient needs close monitoring of blood glucose levels and insulin therapy as needed.
10. Lines and Prophylaxis: The patient has multiple lines, including an arterial line and multi-lumen central line. Prophyl"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock and bacteremia. She has been admitted to the ICU for close monitoring and treatment. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 84 bpm, blood pressure of 125/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. She is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

The patient's blood cultures were positive for coagulase-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia, which is being treated with nafcillin. Surveillance cultures will be taken until they are negative twice. The patient's CVP levels are being monitored and maintained above 12, and she is on pressors to keep her mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 60.

An MRI of the spine and brain was performed, which showed no evidence of osteomyelitis, epidural abscess, or new brain metastases. A transthoracic echo (TTE) was ordered but had a limited study, so a transesophageal echo (TEE) will be performed today.

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER-positive breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She was most recently treated on April 14th with a third cycle of Doxil, and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient also experienced a fall at home last week and is on intravenous antibiotics for GPC bacteremia.

The patient was admitted with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, tachycardia (120s), and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, altered mental status/somnolence, likely due to sepsis with MSSA bacteremia/bacteriuria and possible contribution of narcotics.

The patient's current medical conditions include hypotension, sepsis, medication effect, fevers, respiratory failure, pain, oncologic condition, and a clavicular fracture. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C (98.7 F), heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 97/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%.

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count of 2.2 K/uL, hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, platelet count of 145 K/uL, blood glucose of 96 mg/dL, and sodium level of 138 mEq"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a critically ill individual with hypotension and fevers. They have undergone several diagnostic tests, including a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, head, and chest, which showed no signs of epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, brain metastases, or skull metastases. A trans-thoracic echo revealed no vegetations and had limited study. The patient has been on various antibiotics, including gentamicin, cefepime, nafcillin, and SMX/TMP. They are currently receiving infusions of fentanyl and midazolam, as well as heparin sodium for prophylaxis. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.1°C, heart rate of 104 bpm, blood pressure of 97/64 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a respiratory support mode of CPAP/PSV. The review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for the presence of fevers. The patient's medical and family history, as well as physical examination findings, are also unchanged except for the absence of peripheral pulses in both lower extremities.

Potential Medical Complications:
Based on the information provided, there are several potential medical complications that can arise. These include:

   Total time spent: 45 minutes
   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER+ breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She was most recently treated with a third cycle of Doxil, and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient also has a history of a fall at home last week and is on IV antibiotics for GPC bacteremia. She was admitted with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, tachycardia (120s) and fevers.

The patient's condition has been unstable, requiring transfer to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. The initial presentation suggests sepsis with MSSA bacteremia/bacteriuria, contributing to hypotension and altered mental status. The patient is also suspected of having Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP).

The main issues at present are fevers, likely multifactorial including MSSA bacteremia, evaluation for source, and potential subacute endocarditis. A trans-thoracic echo (TTE) was performed but showed no vegetations, and a trans-esophageal echo (TEE) is pending. An MRI of the spine and head was also performed to rule out an epidural abscess.

The patient remains intubated due to poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs), likely due to new-onset PJP, kyphosis/restrictive lung disease, and oxygenation issues. The main concerns include somnolence/AMS"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and potential medical issues:

1. Hypotension: The patient is hypotensive, which may be due to MSSA bacteremia and narcotics. The patient's CVPs are at goal, and she is not on pressors.

2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia. She has been receiving nafcillin, and TTE has been negative for vegetations. An MRI was negative for spinal osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. A TEE will be performed today as anesthesia is required due to the patient's kyphosis.

3. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly due to multiple doses of dilaudid on the floor and a fentanyl patch. A robust response to narcan suggests a narcotic overdose. An MRI was negative for any new brain metastases.

4. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, with new hypoxia that may be worsening PCP pneumonia or ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). She required intubation for respiratory distress on admission to the ICU. ABG results show a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 40 mmHg, and PaO2 of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been in the ICU for several days and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, hypotension, MSSA bacteremia, altered mental status, and pain. Her condition has been complicated by various factors including worsening airspace disease on chest X-ray, inability to pass a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) probe due to kyphosis, and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation due to ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the prolonged mechanical ventilation and worsening airspace disease on chest X-ray, there is a risk of developing VAP.
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The presence of MSSA bacteremia and the use of multi-lumen central lines increase the risk of CLABSI.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Immobility and the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin increase the risk of DVT and subsequent PE.
4. Nosocomial delirium: Prolonged ICU stay, multiple medications, and the inability to assess mental status accurately increase the risk of nosocomial delirium.
5. Pressure injuries: Immobility and prolonged use of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted to the ICU for hypotension, altered mental status, and fevers. She has a history of recent treatment for breast cancer, a fall at home, and is on steroid taper after spine radiation. Initial presentation suggested sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and urinary tract infection. She remains hemodynamically stable but intubated, with poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) likely due to new pneumonia (PJP), kyphosis/restrictive lung disease, and progressive bilateral infiltrates. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers: The patient has had ongoing fevers since admission, which are likely multifactorial including MSSA bacteremia and possible Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteremia.
2. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP): The patient is at high risk for PJP due to immunosuppressive therapy and poor lung support. It is suspected that she has developed PJP, and appropriate treatment with Bactrim is being administered.
3. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's worsening infiltrates and ARDS physiology may contribute to difficulty with SBT and potential extubation.
4. Diarrhea: The patient has developed diarrhea, which could be due to antibiotic-associated colitis or other causes. Clostridium difficile infection should be ruled out.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER+ breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone and liver. She was recently treated with the third cycle of Doxil and is on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient presented with hypotension, fevers, and somnolence, and was admitted to the ICU for further management.

24-hour events include an unsuccessful attempt to pass an esophageal scope, blood cultures being drawn from both venipuncture and arterial line, and sputum culture being obtained. The patient's condition has deteriorated, with worsening infiltrates on chest X-ray and development of ARDS-like physiology.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient is likely experiencing sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and bacteriuria, possibly due to a previous fall at home. The patient also has suspected Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and progressive bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Broadened coverage for Hospital-acquired pneumonia/Ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) has been initiated with Zosyn and Vancomycin.

The patient's main issues include fevers, MSSA bacteremia, progressive infiltrates on CXR, and respiratory failure. The team is considering bronchoscopy and is holding bowel reg for possible C. difficile.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis with MSSA bacteremia
2. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)
3. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome)
4. Diarrhea (holding bowel reg for possible C. difficile)
5. Respiratory failure
6. Chronic pain from bone metastases"

   Disposition:
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to suspected ARDS, likely worsening of PCP pneumonia, and difficulty ventilating. The patient has been receiving various treatments including antibiotics, steroids, and pain management medications. She also has a history of clavicular fracture, altered mental status possibly due to narcotic overdose, and a recent episode of diarrhea.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): The patient's respiratory status is worsening, with increasing difficulty ventilating and the presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. ARDS is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention and management.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Appropriate measures should be taken to prevent and treat this condition.
3. Clostridium difficile infection (C. Diff): The patient has been receiving multiple antibiotics, which increases the risk of C. Diff infection. It is important to monitor for symptoms such as diarrhea and check for C. Diff colonization.
4. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobilization and underlying malignancy increase the risk of DVT. Prophylactic measures should be continued to prevent clot formation.
5. Stress ulcer"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. The patient is currently in the ICU for respiratory failure due to pneumonia, and there are concerns about the worsening of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).

The patient has been treated empirically for IE (infective endocarditis) and is now being considered for palliative care, including discussions about xrt (radiation therapy) and increasing fentanyl boluses every hour as needed. The patient's current medications include midazolam, fentanyl, ranitidine, and heparin.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate in the 140s, hypoxia with an oxygen saturation of 93%, and hypertension with a blood pressure of 134/69 mmHg. The patient's respiratory status is concerning, with increasing difficulty ventilating and a need for increased oxygen support.

The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count of 11.2 K/uL, slightly decreased Hct level of 36.7%, and normal platelet count of 170 K/uL. The blood cultures have grown Staphylococcus aureus coagulase positive. Other lab results, including electrolytes and liver function tests, are within normal limits.

Imaging studies show bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray"

   Patient is critically ill
   Bronchoscopy was attempted during rounds.  There was evidence of large
   clot adherent to ET in distal trachea and concern for foreign body (?
   Metal or tooth) though possibly clotted blood, with difficulty
   advancing the scope. IP was called for bronch and further assess. This
   area appeared c/w clot and no foreign body was visualized.  There was
   evidence of trauma to tracheal walls likely the cause of bleeding.  No
   evidence of active distal bleed to suggest alveolar hem.  BAL and cx
   sent.
   I met with patient
s husband and updated him to current status and
   bronch results.  He understands that we are treating for PCP and
   empirically for HAP/VAP as well as presumed MSSA SBE.  We discussed her
   worsening respiratory condition c/w ards, increasing o2 requirements on
   the vent, and ongoing low grade fevers concerning for resistant inf vs
   fungal inf.  At present her hemodynamics remain stable with no pressor
   requirements and her MS has improved.  Her resp status however remains
   very tenuous.  I began to address goals of care and encouraged him to
   think and speak with pts oncologist who will be back tomorrow.  We will
   keep family updated as to any changes.  At this time it is difficult to
   predict but her resp status is critical and tenuous and could
   decompensate.  We will continue with current aggressive vent support
   and have called for an ID consult.
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver, who was admitted with right shoulder pain and clavicular fracture. She also had bacteremia and bacteriuria caused by MSSA, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension and altered mental status.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fevers: Despite receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient continues to have low-grade fevers.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is experiencing worsening hypoxemia and bilateral infiltrates. There is a concern for ARDS, possibly related to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a resistant bug, or fungal infection. Bronchoscopy was attempted but could not be advanced due to a large clot adherent to the endotracheal tube, and no foreign body was visualized.
3. Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP): The patient was diagnosed with PCP and started on Bactrim. However, she continues to have temperatures despite the antibiotic coverage.
4. Diarrhea: The patient had diarrhea, which has resolved. Clostridium difficile (C. diff) was negative, ruling out C. diff colitis.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs further evaluation.
6. Pain: The patient has chronic pain due to bone metastases and a clavicular fracture."

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of ER-positive breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver. She recently underwent chemotherapy and is on a steroid taper after spine radiation.
- The patient presented with right shoulder pain, generalized weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was admitted with hypotension and altered mental status.
- Initial presentation suggested sepsis with MSSA bacteremia and bacteriuria, as well as a possible narcotic effect contributing to hypotension and altered mental status.
- The patient is now intubated with poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials, likely due to new pneumonia (PJP), kyphosis/restrictive disease, and progressive bilateral infiltrates.
- The main issues include fevers, MSSA bacteremia, suspected progressive ARDS, pulmonary hemorrhage, respiratory failure, and worsening hypoexmia.
- The patient's condition is critical, and there are concerns about multiple potential medical complications such as PJP pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, fungal infection, cardiogenic edema/leaky capillaries, or ARDS.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. PJP Pneumonia: The patient has worsening bilateral infiltrates and is being treated empirically for PJP due to poor tolerance of spontaneous breathing trials.
2. Alveolar Hemorrhage: The presence of bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube raises concern for alveolar hemorrhage.
3. Fungal Infection: Despite aggressive coverage, the patient continues to have fevers, which could indicate a fungal infection.
4. Cardiogenic Edema/Leaky Capillaries: The patient's ARDS physiology and worsening infiltrates may suggest cardiogenic edema or leaky capillaries.
5. Pulmonary Hemorrhage: The bloody secretions from the endotracheal tube may indicate pulmonary hemorrhage.
6. ARDS: The patient's worsening condition, including hypoexmia and bilateral infiltrates, is consistent with the development of ARDS.
7. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has ongoing MSSA bacteremia despite antibiotic treatment.
8. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is deteriorating, with worsening hypoexmia and bilateral infiltrates.
9. Diarrhea: The patient has diarrhea, which is being investigated for Clostridium difficile infection.
10. Anemia: The patient has anemia, which requires further evaluation.
11. Pain: The patient is experiencing chronic pain due to bone metastases and a recent fracture.
12. Clavicular Fracture: The patient has a mid-clavicle fracture.
13. Tachycardia: The patient continues to have tachycardia, likely due to pain, fevers, and infection.
14. Somnolence/AMS/Delirium: The patient initially had altered mental status but has since resolved.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided progress note, and further evaluation and testing may be required to confirm the presence of these potential medical complications."

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with ARDS and has shown progression of the disease since imaging on 5/23. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 37.8°C (100.7°F), heart rate of 106 bpm, blood pressure of 82/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 91%. 

The patient is on mechanical ventilation with a ventilator mode of CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow, set tidal volume (Vt) of 400 mL, respiratory rate (RR) of 12 breaths per minute, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 cmH2O, and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 60%. The plateau pressure is 27 cmH2O. 

The patient's laboratory results show a white blood cell count (WBC) of 3.7-3.9 thousand/mm3, hemoglobin (Hct) of 36.7-31.7%, platelet count (Plt) of 170-158 thousand/mm3, creatinine (Cr) of 0.2 mg/dL, blood glucose of 80-127 mg/dL, and lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L. 

Imaging shows diffuse patchy opacities and scattered ground-glass opacities suggestive of infective change in both lungs, with the cuff of the endotracheal tube being slightly over-inflated and the tip of the tube 2 cm from the carina. There are also bilateral rib fractures, fracture of the right clavicle, and lytic sclerotic lesions in the axial and appendicular skeleton. 

The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, and an MRI was negative for spinal osteomyelitis or epidural abscess. The patient's pain is being managed with a fentanyl patch and PRN fentanyl, and consideration is being given to starting methadone. 

The patient's breast cancer has shown some response to therapy based on tumor markers, and a discussion regarding goals of care is planned today with the patient and her husband. 

The patient is tolerating tube feeds and is at risk for aspiration of gastric contents. Her recent medications include Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn), Vancomycin, Bactrim (SMX/TMP), Nafcillin, Midazolam (Versed), Fentanyl, Heparin Sodium (Prophylaxis), and Solumedrol. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), stress ulcer bleeding, and nosocomial infections."

","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) due to PCP (Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia) that has worsened with treatment. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been receiving various medications including steroids, antibiotics, and other supportive care measures.

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Since the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP, which is a type of lung infection that can occur in individuals who are receiving mechanical ventilation.

2. Nosocomial infections: Given the patient's prolonged stay in the ICU and the use of invasive lines and devices, there is a risk of developing nosocomial infections such as catheter-related bloodstream infections or central line-associated meningitis.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): Prolonged immobility and bed rest increase the risk of developing blood clots in the legs (DVT) which can potentially travel to the lungs and cause a PE.

4. Ventricular arrhythmias: The patient's history of metastatic breast cancer and the use of steroids may predispose her to cardiac complications, including ventricular"

   CONCLUSION:
   1. Diffuse patchy opacities as well as scattered ground-glass opacities
   suggestive of infective change in both lungs. There may be an element
   of
   superimposed pulmonary edema.
   2. The cuff of the ET tube is slightly over-inflated and the tip of the
   ET
   tube is 2 cm from the carina.
   3. Interval progression of the metastatic disease as suggested by
   bilateral
   rib fractures, fracture of the right clavicle and lytic sclerotic
   lesions in
   the axial and appendicular skeleton.

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is in the ICU with a chief complaint of ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome).
- A bronchoscopy was performed on 5/7, showing diffuse ground glass opacities in both lungs, suggestive of an infectious process, and no evidence of pulmonary embolism.
- The patient's ET (endotracheal) tube was low by 2 cm from the carina, and there was balloon hyperinflation.
- Gram stain on bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) was negative, but erosion was observed without any diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH).
- The patient's ID (infectious disease) doctor recommended discontinuing vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam, and treating with IV solumedrol, equivalent to prednisone 60mg daily.
- The patient has hyponatremia and a concern for SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone). Free water restriction was implemented.
- ABG (arterial blood gas) values were stable to improved during the 24-hour period.
- The patient is autodiuresing.
- Fungal studies were sent.
- The ET tube position was repositioned overnight, and it appeared reasonable on the morning X-ray.
- The patient received solumedrol 20mg IV every 8 hours starting overnight, equivalent to 60mg PO prednisone.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver, who has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. She was treated at home for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and admitted with right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension, altered mental status/somnolence, and respiratory failure due to ARDS, PJP pneumonia, and likely sepsis caused by MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria. She has been diagnosed with PJP pneumonia and started on Bactrim, but remains unstable with ongoing issues including fevers, known MSSA bacteremia, progressive pulmonary infiltrates, and respiratory failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient's initial presentation to the ICU was likely sepsis due to MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria, which further contributed to hypotension and altered mental status.
2. ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome): The patient has diffuse bilateral infiltrates and hypoxemia, indicating ARDS, likely in the setting of progression of PJP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver, who was admitted to the ICU with hypotension, altered mental status/somnolence, and fevers. The initial presentation suggested sepsis due to MSSA bacteremia/bacteriuria. The patient was treated for PJP pneumonia and ARDS. Despite broadened coverage for HAP/VAP and continued treatment with Bactrim, the patient continues to mount fevers, develop increasing bilateral infiltrates, and show worsening Pa/FiO2 ratio. There are concerns for progressive ARDS, possible alveolar hemorrhage, PCP, resistant bacterial infection, or fungal infection.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Fevers - improving, likely due to ongoing infection.
2. PJP - being treated with Bactrim.
3. Progressive pulmonary infiltrates - bronchoscopy with pan-culture sent.
4. Respiratory failure - ARDS by Pa/FiO2 ratio, possibly related to VAP, resistant bug, fungal infection, or PCP.
5. Bloody secretions from ET - possibly related to PJP or alveolar hemorrhage.
6. Hyponatremia - likely due to lung process or medications.
7. Hypotension - never requiring pressor support, likely due to sepsis or ARDS.
8. Somnolence/AMS/delirium - likely due to narcotic"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS due to PCP pneumonia. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2°C, heart rate of 118 bpm, blood pressure of 158/88 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 93%. She is intubated and on mechanical ventilation.

The patient's medical history includes steroid use for her breast cancer treatment and recent doxil chemotherapy. She has shown some improvement in her disease course with decreased tumor markers.

The patient's laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet levels. Her blood glucose levels are within normal range, but her calcium and magnesium levels are slightly low. Her liver function tests are also within normal limits.

The patient has diffuse ground glass opacities on a CT scan, consistent with ARDS. Her ABG results indicate permissive hypercapnia in the setting of ARDS. She has an elevated lactate level of 1.9 mmol/L.

The patient's plan of care includes continuing steroid treatment, antibiotics, and fungal coverage. She will be followed up with repeat ABG measurements, sputum culture, and imaging studies. Gentle diuresis will be initiated to improve her fluid status. The patient's pain control will be managed with f"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS due to PCP pneumonia and is currently on mechanical ventilation. Her oxygenation has improved overnight, and her ABG results are encouraging. She is tolerating tube feeds and is being closely monitored for aspiration. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's ARDS could worsen, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: There is a risk of new infections due to immunosuppression from steroids and chemotherapy.
3. Cardiovascular instability: The patient has been hypertensive and previously required pressors, indicating potential volume status issues.
4. Gastrointestinal complications: The patient is at risk for gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly given her use of anticoagulants and the presence of an NG tube.
5. Neurological complications: The patient's altered mental status may persist or worsen, potentially leading to prolonged ICU stay or poor quality of life.
6. Thromboembolic events: The patient is at risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), especially considering her prolonged immobilization and malignancy.
7. Metabolic disturbances: The patient may develop electrolyte imbalances, hyperglycemia, or other metabolic derangements due to stress and medications.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver, who has been treated with chemotherapy and steroid taper after spine radiation. She was admitted for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria, right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. She now presents with respiratory failure, ARDS, and PJP pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis: The patient has known MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and may develop sepsis if the infection progresses.
2. PJP Pneumonia: The patient has been diagnosed with PJP pneumonia and is being treated with Bactrim. The condition requires ongoing monitoring for improvement in oxygenation.
3. ARDS: The patient has diffuse bilateral infiltrates and a Pa/FiO2 ratio consistent with ARDS. Lung-protective ventilation strategies are being implemented, and further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
4. Alveolar Hemorrhage: Bloody secretions from the bronchial tube may indicate alveolar hemorrhage, which should be further evaluated.
5. Tracheal Erosion: The presence of bloody secretions may also suggest tracheal erosion due to suction trauma.
6. Immune Reconstitution Syndrome: The patient's return of blood counts post-chemo may contribute to immune reconstitution"

She was treated at home for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and admitted with right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who has been treated with chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. She was admitted with right shoulder pain and clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient is now in the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. She has a history of MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and is being treated with antibiotics.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), and possible sepsis. She has been started on Bactrim for PJP and her steroids have been broadened after sending bronchoscopy samples. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and has improved mental status.

Active issues include fevers, known MSSA bacteremia, PJP, progressive pulmonary infiltrates, and ARDS by Pa/FiO2 ratio. The patient's bloody secretions may be due to suspected PJP, inflammatory response, or immune reconstitution after chemotherapy. Further investigations such as GM and B d-glucan are pending, as well as bronchial lavage cultures. Lung-protective ventilation is being used, and pressures are being maintained within acceptable ranges.

Other concerns include diarrhea, which has resolved, anemia, pain from clavicular fracture and chronic pain due to bone metastasis, oncological issues, hypon"

   Addendum:
   Pt became very dysnchronpus on vent at 3PM. ABG essentially stable but
   make a mode change to PCV 30/14 and with this in addition to suction
   and sedation, she was able to oxygenate more effectively.
   Of note, she then spiked temperature at 3:15 to 101.3- will pan
   culture, check CXR and broaden ABX to add back Vanco and
   Meropenem.
","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone and liver. She has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient also has a known MSSA bacteremia and bacteruria and was treated at home. She presented to the hospital with right shoulder pain and a clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was subsequently transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status.

Upon admission to the ICU, the patient was found to have respiratory failure, ARDS, and PJP pneumonia. She was started on Bactrim and her steroids were broadened. The patient remains hemodynamically stable and has shown improvement in oxygenation. Active issues include fevers, known MSSA bacteremia, PJP pneumonia, and progressive pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's medical complications include sepsis, ARDS, PJP pneumonia, and a tracheal erosion likely from suction trauma. The patient's pain management plan includes fentanyl and methadone. The patient's anemia has resolved, and her diarrhea and hyponatremia have improved. She is no longer neutropenic and is responding well to chemotherapy based on tumor markers. The patient's current primary problem is her lung issue related to the ICU stay.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Sepsis: The patient has known MSSA bacteremia and"

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and PCP pneumonia, which has worsened with treatment. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk for developing VAP due to being on mechanical ventilation for an extended period. This can be prevented by following strict infection control measures and regular assessment of lung sounds.

2. Nosocomial infections: The patient's immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay increase the risk of nosocomial infections such as central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI), or surgical site infections (SSI).

3. Barotrauma: ARDS patients are at risk for barotrauma, which is lung injury caused by high airway pressures during mechanical ventilation. Close monitoring of airway pressures and appropriate adjustment of ventilator settings can help prevent this complication.

4. Pneumothorax: Patients with ARDS are susceptible to pneumothorax, which is the accumulation of air in the pleural space. Regular chest radiographs and prompt recognition of any signs of pneumothorax are essential to prevent its occurrence.

5. Fluid overload: The patient may be at risk of fluid overload due to positive"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). The patient's condition has worsened despite treatment, with diffuse airspace opacities seen on chest X-ray. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and ceftazidime, due to recurrent fevers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation, there is an increased risk of developing VAP. The patient's recent fevers and worsening respiratory status may indicate a possible VAP infection.

2. Fungal infection: Immunosuppressed patients, such as those with metastatic breast cancer receiving steroids, are at higher risk for fungal infections. The patient's low-grade temperatures and diffuse ground-glass opacities on CT scan raise the suspicion of a possible fungal infection.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged immobility in the ICU setting increases the risk of developing DVT. The patient's recent tachycardia and inadequate pain control could also be signs of a possible DVT.

4. Narcotic overdose: The patient's altered mental status after receiving multiple doses of dilaudid and a response to narcan suggests a possible narcotic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver, who has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. She was admitted for MSSA bacteremia/bacteriuria and treated at home. She presented with right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence. The patient now has respiratory failure, ARDS, and PJP pneumonia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. New fever - The patient has developed a new fever, which could indicate an ongoing infection or another complication.
2. Bleeding from ETT - There is a concern for bleeding from the endotracheal tube, possibly due to coagulopathy or platelet dysfunction.
3. PJP - The patient has been diagnosed with PJP pneumonia, which requires treatment with Bactrim for 14 days and increased steroid doses.
4. ARDS, vent, respiratory failure - The patient is experiencing ARDS and respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation. Weaning of FiO2 and PEEP should be done cautiously.
5. I/O - The patient's input/output balance should be closely monitored, especially sodium levels.
6. Tachycardia - The patient has sinus tachycardia, possibly due to pain or other factors. Pain control should be optimized.

","Summary of the Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of breast cancer metastatic to the bone and liver, who has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. She was treated at home for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and admitted with right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient is now in the ICU due to hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence.

24-hour events include the collection of blood cultures, urine culture, and sputum culture. The patient experienced a fever of 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit and had difficulty synchronizing with the ventilator, requiring a mode change to PCV 30/14 and suctioning. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started, and all lines and drains were cultured.

Vital signs show a temperature of 38 degrees Celsius, heart rate of 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 88/53 mmHg, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's weight is currently 70 kg, and her height is 60 inches. Central venous pressure (CVP) is 13 mmHg. Fluid balance shows an input of 4,974 mL and output of 4,365 mL, with a positive balance of 609 mL. Respiratory support includes ventilation with a tidal volume of 400 mL, respiratory rate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver. She has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient was previously treated at home for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and admitted with right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence.

24-hour events include fever, blood cultures taken multiple times, urine culture taken, and sputum culture taken. The patient became dysynchronous on the ventilator, and a mode change to PCV 30/14 was made along with suction and sedation, which improved oxygenation. Her temperature then spiked to 101.3 degrees, prompting the addition of Vancomycin and Meropenem to her antibiotic regimen. No known drug allergies were reported.

The patient's vital signs are as follows:
- Temperature: 38.5°C (101.3°F)
- Heart rate: 105 bpm
- Blood pressure: 88/53 mmHg
- Respiratory rate: 19 breaths per minute
- Oxygen saturation: 96%
- Central venous pressure: 13 mmHg

Fluid balance shows an intake of 4,974 mL and an output of 4,365 mL, resulting in a positive balance of 609 mL. The patient is receiving respiratory"

   Arterial Line
   Patient was preppred and draped in a sterile fasion.  1cc lidocaine
   injected as local anesthetic.  L-radial artery was then cannulated and
   wire was inserted.  Over this wire arterial line for BP measurement was
   then inserted.  Line was then sutured in place.  There were no
   complications.  EBL 0-5cc.
","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient underwent a procedure to have an arterial line inserted in the ICU.
- The procedure was performed using sterile precautions.
- Local anesthetic (1cc lidocaine) was injected to numb the area.
- The L-radial artery was cannulated and a wire was inserted.
- An arterial line for blood pressure measurement was then placed over the wire.
- The line was secured in place with sutures.
- There were no complications during the procedure.
- Minimal bleeding occurred (5cc).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Arterial rupture or bleeding: Although there was minimal bleeding during the procedure, there is a risk of arterial rupture or significant bleeding if the artery is damaged during cannulation or if the line becomes dislodged.
2. Infection: Despite the use of sterile precautions, there is still a risk of infection at the site where the arterial line was inserted.
3. Thrombosis or clot formation: The arterial line can potentially cause thrombosis or clot formation in the artery, which may lead to ischemia or reduced blood flow to the affected area.
4. Hematoma: Injury to the artery during cannulation can result in the formation of a hematoma (a collection of blood) at the insertion site.
5. Pain or discomfort: The patient may experience pain or discomfort at the site of arterial line insertion, especially if the local anesthetic did not fully take effect or if the line becomes uncomfortable or displaced."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and PCP pneumonia. The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation with PCV mode, PEEP of 12, and FiO2 of 60%. Her ABG results show a PaO2 / FiO2 ratio of 128. The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 115/62 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, anemia, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging reveals diffuse bilateral patchy opacities in the lungs, consistent with ARDS, and wide bone involvement by metastatic spread. The patient's current medications include IV steroids, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and Bactrim.

Potential Medical Complications:

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver. She has undergone chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. The patient was treated at home for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and admitted with right shoulder pain, clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status. The patient now has respiratory failure and ARDS due to PCP pneumonia. She also has MSSA bacteremia and requires endocarditis dose/duration of antibiotics. The patient is being treated with a 14-day course of Bactrim for PJP, and her pain is being managed with fentanyl patches and IV medications. She has improved tumor marker levels. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS and PCP pneumonia.
2. MSSA bacteremia and potential endocarditis.
3. PJP infection.
4. Bleeding from the endotracheal tube.
5. Fluid imbalance and electrolyte disturbances.
6. Tachycardia.
7. Pain management.
8. Oncological complications related to metastatic breast cancer."

The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver, who has been treated with chemotherapy and is currently on a steroid taper after spine radiation. She was admitted for MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria and treated at home. The patient presented with right shoulder pain, clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. She was transferred to the ICU for hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence. The patient now has respiratory failure and ARDS due to PCP pneumonia. She also has a new fever and is experiencing bleeding from the endotracheal tube. 

Potential medical complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)
2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI)
3. Aspiration pneumonia
4. Stress ulcers
5. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
6. Nosocomial infection due to MSSA
7. Catheter-related thrombosis
8. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)
9. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
10. Diarrhea, possibly caused by Clostridium difficile (C. diff)"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer to the bone and liver, who has been treated with chemotherapy and received spine radiation. She also had MSSA bacteremia/bacteruria at home and was admitted for right shoulder pain/clavicular fracture, weakness, tachycardia, and fevers. The patient was transferred to the ICU due to hypotension and altered mental status/somnolence.

The patient has multiple medical complications including respiratory failure, ARDS, PJP pneumonia, fever, bleeding from ETT, visual hallucinations, and tachycardia. She is currently on broad-spectrum antibiotics, receiving ventilatory support with PCV mode, and being monitored closely for any changes in her condition.

The potential medical complications that can arise from these conditions include worsening respiratory failure leading to further deterioration in oxygenation and ventilation, progression of ARDS leading to increased difficulty in weaning off ventilatory support, development of nosocomial infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), bleeding complications due to the use of anticoagulants and thrombocytopenia, and potential endocarditis due to MSSA bacteremia.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly blood pressure and heart rate, administer appropriate antibiotic therapy to address existing infections and prevent new ones, ensure adequate pain control to minimize tachycardia and agitation, and optimize glycemic control to"

   61F with PMH metastatic breast CA on steroids, s/p third cycle doxil
   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia
   .
   #Repiratory failure: ARDS [**1-17**] PCP pneumonia that has worsened w/
   treatment.  No evidence of PE, diffuse aveolar hemorrhage or fungal
   infections at this time.  On IV steroids.  Patient oxygenating now with
   PCV with PEEP of 12 and has been improving clinically by ABG and vent
   settings, but CXR slightly worse.  Attempt to decrease PEEP during day
   today though may be difficult given CXR findings.  CTA showing diffuse
   ground glass opacities.  Now also on VAP coverage.
   -For presumed VAP: Vanc/Ceftaz: Day 1 [**5-9**] -> continue for 48 hours
   and consider d/c if cultures negative.  Did decompensate with d/c of
   abx earlier and may be reasonable to continue for full course.
   -For PCP: [**Name Initial (NameIs) **]: Day 1 [**5-4**], - continue solumedrol.
   - Bronch growing PCP otherwise [**Name9 (PRE) 2908**], [**Name Initial (PRE) **]/w ID who feel not surprising to
   grow PCP on BAL in first few days of therapy. Now new sputum culture
   pending to check for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2924**]. Could consider second line PCP
   treatment if not yet cleared on [**Name Initial (PRE) 1369**].
   - follow ABG [**Hospital1 **], repeat gas on new settings and wean PEEP as
   tolerated.  Goal Oxygenation > 90%, paO2 > 60
   - f/u fungal studies and consider broadening to cover fungus if fever
   curve rises
   - Attempt diuresis as tolerated, but BP limiting ability to take fluid
   off, wean PEEP with hope of improving hypotension.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure caused by ARDS and PCP pneumonia. The patient is also being treated for MSSA bacteremia and VAP. Her vital signs are stable, but she has hypovolemia and anemia. The patient is receiving IV steroids, antibiotics, and antifungal medication. She is tolerating tube feeds but requires close monitoring for aspiration. The patient's pain is being managed with fentanyl patches and gtt, and she is also receiving gabapentin and a lidocaine patch for pain relief. She has a clavicular fracture, which is being managed with an ortho rec sling and pain medication. The patient's nutritional status is being closely monitored, and her code status is full code.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory status is critical due to ARDS and PCP pneumonia. There is a risk of worsening respiratory failure if the treatment does not effectively control the underlying causes.

2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is at risk of developing VAP due to her prolonged mechanical ventilation. Early identification and prompt treatment are essential to prevent complications.

3. Central Line-Associated Bloodstream Infection (CLABSI): The patient has multiple central"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and pneumonia, and is currently on IV steroids. The patient's oxygenation has improved with PCV ventilation and PEEP of 12, but her chest x-ray shows worsening infiltrates bilaterally. She is also being treated for presumed ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). The patient's blood cultures are pending to check for PCP, and she may need a second-line treatment for PCP if not cleared. Her goal oxygenation is to maintain an oxygen saturation above 90% and a PaO2 above 60.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure. She is already on mechanical ventilation, but there is a risk of worsening respiratory function due to the bilateral infiltrates seen on her chest x-ray.
2. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient is being treated empirically for VAP, but it is important to continue monitoring for signs of infection and adjusting antibiotic therapy as necessary.
3. Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia (PCP): The patient is at risk for PCP due to her immunocompromised state from chemotherapy and steroid use. She is currently"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She is currently on IV steroids, pentamidine for PCP, and nafcillin for Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. The goal is to maintain oxygenation above 90% and follow up on fungal studies. The patient is also being treated for MSSA bacteremia with a 6-week course of antibiotics. She has anemia with a fluctuating HCT between 20-23, and her baseline heart rate is around 100, which is stable. The patient is experiencing visual hallucinations but not actively at present. She has a clavicular fracture and is using an orthopedic sling for immobilization. She is tolerating tube feeds and her C. difficile test is negative.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
2. MSSA bacteremia.
3. Anemia with a fluctuating HCT between 20-23.
4. Tachycardia with a baseline heart rate of around 100.
5. Visual hallucinations.
6. Clavicular fracture.
7. Potential development of C. difficile infection.
8. Potential development of other hospital-acquired infections.

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Potential medical complications that can arise in this case include:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters, such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio and respiratory system compliance, will be essential.

2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Given the patient's prolonged intubation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Regular assessment of lung sounds and sputum cultures should be performed. Early weaning from mechanical ventilation and maintaining appropriate head-of-bed elevation can help prevent VAP.

3. MSSA bacteremia: The patient is being treated for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia. Close monitoring of blood cultures and adjusting antibiotic therapy accordingly is necessary.

4. Volume status: The patient is third spacing fluids, which can lead to fluid overload and subsequent complications like pulmonary edema or acute kidney injury. Careful monitoring of intake and output, as well as daily weight measurements, will help assess fluid balance.

5. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is low, indicating anemia."

","Summary of the patient's progress note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP treatment and has shown a slight decrease in FiO2 requirement. She continues to be febrile, and cultures have not shown any positive results recently. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin. There are concerns about fluid balance as the patient is third spacing fluids, so diuretics will be used to slowly drain excess fluid. The patient's anemia will be managed with blood transfusions if necessary. Pain and anxiety are well controlled with medication. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and palliative chemotherapy will be considered once the PCP infection improves. She has a clavicular fracture, for which she is using a sling and pain medication. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and there are no current gastrointestinal issues. She has two lines for vascular access. The patient's code status is full code, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU.

Potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Infection: The patient is still febrile, indicating a possible ongoing infection despite being on antibiotics. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and culture results is necessary to identify and"

   Assessment and Plan
   61F with PMH metastatic breast CA on steroids, s/p third cycle doxil
   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia now with PCP
   pneumonia and ARDS.
   #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -continue on IV steroids and current vent settings, slow trend towards
   worsening oxygenation, continue PEEP 12 and FiO2 of 70%
   -currently on pentamidine for PCP per ID the patient is a bactrim
   failure, continue to monitor while on new regimen
   - Goal Oxygenation > 90%, paO2 > 60
   - Attempt diuresis as tolerated- volume overloaded, give 10mg IV lasix
   as BP is tolerating now.
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -plan for extended course for staph auerus bacteremia.  Continue vanc
   as spiking temps on nafcilling.
   -hemodynamically stable, f/u culture data
   #Volume:  patient is third spacing fluids- as above diurese slowly,
   goal I/O even for today.
   # anemia: s/p tx 1uPRBC on [**5-13**], hct increased appropriately., continue
   daily hct.
   # Pain: on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.  Patient would like
   something for sleep at 5 p.m.
   -d/w palliative care team re: pain / anxiety control
   #Breast CA: Progressive and metastatic.
   -Defer to onc team
 has shown some response to therapy on basis of
   tumor markers and will likely get palliative chemotherapy.
   # Clavicular fracture: Ortho rec sling, pain control with fentanyl
   patch and gtt and lidocaine patch to clavicular area

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She is currently on IV steroids and mechanical ventilation, and is being treated with pentamidine for PCP and an extended course of vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia. The patient is also experiencing volume overload and anemia, and has a clavicular fracture. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, heart rate of 100 bpm, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 70% FiO2. The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes. The culture results for urine and blood are negative. The patient's condition requires close monitoring and management of her respiratory failure, MSSA bacteremia, volume status, anemia, and pain control. She is also being considered for palliative chemotherapy for her breast cancer.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia has progressed to ARDS, which is a serious complication characterized by severe inflammation in the lungs leading to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters will be necessary.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacter"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status (AMS), and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 101.2°F, heart rate of 100 bpm, blood pressure of 122/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on ventilator support.

The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.2 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 7.4 g/dL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 133 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels at 0.2 mg/dL. Other lab results are within normal ranges.

The patient has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, PCP pneumonia, and ARDS. The plan includes continuing IV steroids, current ventilator settings, and monitoring oxygenation levels. Diuretics will be given to manage volume overload, and extended antibiotic therapy will be administered for the MSSA bacteremia.

The patient also has anemia, which will be managed with daily red blood cell transfusions. Pain control measures are in place, including the use of a fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. The patient has a clavicular fracture, for which orthopedic"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on IV steroids, mechanical ventilation, and pentamidine for PCP. The goal is to maintain oxygenation above 90% and continue diuretics to manage fluid overload.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation levels and adjustment of ventilator settings will be necessary.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which requires extended antibiotic therapy. Monitoring of culture data and hemodynamic stability will be important to assess the effectiveness of treatment.
3. Volume Overload: The patient is third spacing fluids, leading to volume overload. Slow diuresis with Lasix will be necessary to manage fluid balance.
4. Anemia: The patient has anemia and requires ongoing red blood cell transfusions. Monitoring of hemoglobin levels and adjusting transfusion rates accordingly will be important.
5. Pain Management: The patient is on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl for pain control. Coordination with the palliative care team will be necessary to ensure adequate pain management, especially for sleep at night.
6. Breast Cancer Progression: The patient's breast cancer is progressive and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP, and IV solumedrol for MSSA bacteremia. She continues to spike fevers but remains hemodynamically stable. The patient has been diuresed slowly due to third spacing of fluids, with a goal of even input/output today. Her hemoglobin has dropped 3 points over 24 hours, so a repeat HCT will be done this afternoon, and she will receive another unit of PRBC if her HCT is less than 21. The patient's pain is well controlled on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. She is also taking oral Ativan q6hrs and prn for anxiety/depression, and starting on celexa 10mg po daily. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and will be managed by the oncology team. She has shown some response to therapy based on tumor markers, and will likely receive palliative chemotherapy pending improvement in PCP. The patient has a clavicular fracture, for which she is using a sling and pain is well controlled. She is tolerating tube feeds and her C. Diff test is negative. The patient has two lines, an arterial line, and a PICC line."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS and is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for treatment. The patient continues to be febrile, and cultures have been sent. She also has MSSA bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin. The patient is third-spacing fluids, so diuresis will be managed accordingly. Her hemoglobin levels are low, and she will receive a blood transfusion if her hemoglobin drops below 21 or if she experiences low blood pressure. The patient is on pain medication and is well-controlled. She is also being treated for anxiety and depression. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and the oncology team will provide further treatment recommendations. She has a clavicular fracture and is being managed with a sling. The patient is tolerating tube feeds well, and there are no current issues with diarrhea. She has PICC lines in place for vascular access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS. This condition can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which can cause septic shock and further complications if not adequately treated.
3. Fluid Imbalance: The patient is third-spacing"

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently receiving pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP pneumonia and IV solumedrol for ARDS. Her FiO2 requirement has decreased slightly, and she is being weaned off the ventilator. Repeat LFTs are planned while on pentamidine. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia, for which an extended course of vancomycin is planned. Her volume status is being managed with diuresis, aiming for an input/output balance of -1 to -2 liters. The patient's anemia is stable, and pain management is well-controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. She is also receiving lorazepam for anxiety and citalopram for depression. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and palliative chemotherapy will be considered pending improvement in PCP.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is currently experiencing respiratory failure secondary to Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). She also has MSSA bacteremia. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure of 86/49 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, slightly elevated potassium, and normal liver function tests. The patient has been receiving treatment for PCP with pentamidine and caspofungin for fungal infection. The plan is to wean the FiO2 to 0.5 and then begin PEEP wean if tolerated. Anemia and MSSA bacteremia are also being treated. The patient's breast cancer with metastases will be managed by the oncology team.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is receiving mechanical ventilation, which increases the risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed (HOB), performing mouth care, and monitoring the respiratory system infection score (RSBI) are being implemented to prevent VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Prolonged imm"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP pneumonia, and her FiO2 requirement has slightly decreased. The plan is to continue IV solumedrol, repeat LDH and B glucan tests, and wean FiO2 while keeping PaO2 above 60. Repeat LFTs will also be done while on pentamidine.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS may lead to worsening respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has an extended course of staph aureus bacteremia. If not treated adequately, it can lead to sepsis and organ failure.
3. Volume overload: The patient's fluid balance shows a positive balance of 1,062 mL. This indicates potential volume overload, which can contribute to pulmonary edema and worsening respiratory status.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct is stable but may continue to worsen due to ongoing blood product transfusions. Close monitoring of hemoglobin levels and appropriate management are necessary.
5. Pain management: The patient is well-controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. However, if pain control is inadequate,"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. The patient now presents with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She is on a regimen of pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP treatment. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.1 C, heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation. Her blood work shows leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated lactate levels, and elevated liver enzymes. The patient's fluid balance is negative due to ongoing diuresis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition of PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has an extended course of staph aureus bacteremia, which can lead to septicemia and potential organ dysfunction.
3. Anemia: The patient's stable hematocrit levels indicate ongoing blood loss or decreased production of red blood cells, which can result in fatigue, shortness of breath, and decreased oxygen delivery to tissues.
4. Thrombocytopenia: The patient's low platelet count"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP and an extended course of vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia. She is also receiving IV solumedrol, and her respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with PCV+assist ventilation mode, PEEP set at 10 cmH2O, FiO2 at 50%, and a RSBI of 107. Her vital signs show a heart rate of 89 bpm, blood pressure of 108/59 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 97%. The patient's neurological status is attentive, follows simple commands, and responds appropriately. However, movement, tone, and skin assessment are not evaluated. Laboratory results indicate an elevated white blood cell count and lactate level, as well as decreased hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and albumin. The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and ARDS, MSSA bacteremia, volume management, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, breast cancer, and nutrition. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has been on a fentanyl patch for pain control. Her PICC line and"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP, and IV solumedrol. The respiratory rate has been increasing overnight, and ABG shows resolution of chronic respiratory acidosis but residual metabolic alkalosis. The plan is to attempt switching to pressure support mode with the goal of matching pressures and volumes, and recheck ABG. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia, and the plan is to continue with an extended course of vancomycin. Other assessments and plans include volume management, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, breast cancer, clavicular fracture, nutrition, and gastrointestinal issues. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has no diarrhea. She has two lines, an arterial line, and a PICC line.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's condition of PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for further respiratory failure.
2. Infection: With MSSA bacteremia, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis or other infections.
3. Gastrointestinal issues: Although the patient's C. diff test is negative, she is still at risk for gastrointestinal complications due to her prolonged ICU stay and the use of antibiotics.

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently being treated with pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP pneumonia, as well as continuing IV solumedrol. Her respiratory rate has trended up overnight, and her chronic respiratory acidosis has resolved, leaving her with residual metabolic alkalosis.

The patient also has a high CMV viral load, which started gancyclovir treatment. She has MSSA bacteremia, and the plan is for an extended course of treatment. The patient is goal-directed in terms of fluid management, with stable hemoglobin levels. She is also being managed for pain, anxiety/depression, and breast cancer, which is progressive and metastatic. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has no diarrhea. She has PICC line and a line for access.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
2. CMV infection with a high viral load.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS and is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin therapy. Her respiratory rate has been trending up, and she is experiencing metabolic alkalosis. She is intolerant to pressure support and will be switched back to PCV. She also has a high CMV viral load, for which she has started on ganciclovir. The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and extended therapy is planned. She has daily fevers, and vancomycin levels are being monitored to rule out undertreatment of endocarditis. Her goals for volume management are being maintained, and she is stable with her Hct levels. She is experiencing controlled pain with fentanyl patches and IV fentanyl. Her anxiety and depression are being managed with increased doses of ativan. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and treatment decisions will be made by the oncology team. She has a clavicular fracture, for which she is using a sling and pain management. She is tolerating tube feeds and has tested negative for C. diff three times. She has two central lines, an arterial line, and a PICC line. Prophylactic measures include DVT prevention, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP prevention. The patient's code status is"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP pneumonia. She is also receiving IV solumedrol, and her LDH levels are improving. She is tolerating pressure control ventilation and feels that her breathing has improved. The patient has a high CMV viral load (>100,000), for which gancyclovir has been started. She is being monitored closely for any signs of CMV retinitis. The patient's MSSA bacteremia is being treated with vancomycin, and her fluid balance is being closely monitored due to volume overload. She has anemia and leukopenia, which may be related to her recent chemotherapy or gancyclovir treatment. The patient's pain and anxiety/depression are being managed with fentanyl patch, IV fentanyl, ativan, and citalopram. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, and palliative chemotherapy will be considered once her PCP pneumonia improves. She has a clavicular fracture, which is being managed with a sling and pain control. The patient is tolerating tube feeds and has negative c. diff results. Her arterial and PICC lines are in place for necessary treatments."

The patient is tolerating pressure control ventilation and has a SpO2 of 100%. Her WBC count is low, but her platelet count is within normal range. She has an elevated CMV viral load, and gancyclovir has been started. The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and vancomycin has been initiated. Fluid balance is a concern, and the goal is to maintain even volume status. She has anemia but is not currently bleeding. Pain and anxiety/depression are being managed with medication. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic. She has a clavicular fracture, which is being managed with a sling and pain control. She is tolerating tube feeds, and c. difficile has been ruled out. The patient has PICC line and arterial line access. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and ARDS.
2. CMV infection with high viral load.
3. MSSA bacter"

   Assessment and Plan
   61F with PMH metastatic breast CA on steroids, s/p third cycle doxil
   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia now with PCP
   pneumonia and ARDS.
   #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -patient currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP- [**Name10 (NameIs) 2945**] on
   this regimen
   -continue IV solumedrol at current dose
   -LDH improving, continue to trend
   -repeat glucan still pending, will be helpful in trending
   -back on PCV but now tolerating FiO2 of 50% and minute ventilation is
   about 10 L/min
   -PaO2 141 on FiO2 of 50%, decrease to 40% and repeat ABG to see if
   patient tolerates a lower setting
   # CMV: VL  greater than 100,000.  Started Gancyclovir.
   -follow CMV viral load q week, + initially on [**5-16**], repeat on [**5-22**]
   -ophtho consult - NO evidence of CMV retinitis
   -still treat for prolonged course given diarrhea, possibly related to
   CMV and would qualify for end organ damage
   -Immunoglobulin quantification added on: IgM and IgA are wnl but IgG is
   low, add on sub classification of IgG
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -check vanc level
   -on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis, surveillance
   cultures negative
   #Volume:  Goal even today again, do not replete fluid if negative but
   may diurese if negative, patient is currently volume overloaded.
   # Anemia: hct dropped 3 points.
   -given CMV and diarrhea- guiac stool
   -p.m. hct and T&S, transfuse for HCT < 21
   # Leukopenia: most recent chemo was remote [**4-14**].
   -add on granulocyte count
   -may be related to marrow suppression from gancyclovir, within a
   fluctuating range throughout hospital course, continue to trend
   # Pain: on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.  Pain well controlled.
   # Anxiety / depression: qhs ativan 3mg.  standing and prn ativan.
   - Continue celexa 10mg po daily
   #Breast CA: Progressive and metastatic.
   -Defer to onc team
 has shown some response to therapy on basis of
   tumor markers and will likely get palliative chemotherapy pending
   improvement in PCP.
   # Clavicular fracture:  sling, pain well controlled with fentanyl patch
   and gtt and lidocaine patch to clavicular area
   -per radiology read of cxr [**5-18**] ""Right clavicular fracture with apparent
   increased distraction of the fracture fragments; however, may be
   projectional. Clinical correlation
   advised.""  f/u repeat CXR read from [**5-20**].
   # Nutrition: Tolerating tube feeds
   # GI:  c diff negative x 3
   -having diarrhea which is most likely related to CMV however previous C
   diff  was sent in setting of fever w/o diarrhea, new diarrhea, will r/o
   c diff with 3 x c diff.
   -send toxin B if + diarrhea today
   # Access: PICC line and a line

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently on steroids and undergoing chemotherapy. She presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS and is being treated with pentamidine and caspofungin. The patient's LDH levels are improving, and she is tolerating pressure control ventilation with a FiO2 of 50%. Her PaO2 is 141 on FiO2 of 50%. She has a CMV viral load greater than 100,000 and is being treated with gancyclovir. There is no evidence of CMV retinitis, but she will continue to be treated due to prolonged diarrhea. Her immunoglobulin quantification shows low IgG levels. She has MSSA bacteremia but surveillance cultures are negative. The patient is currently volume overloaded and may require diuresis. Her anemia has worsened, and she may require a blood transfusion. She also has leukopenia, which may be related to marrow suppression from gancyclovir. The patient is experiencing pain well controlled with fentanyl, anxiety/depression managed with ativan and celexa, and her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic. She has a clavicular fracture and is being managed with a sling and pain control. Her nutrition is being supported with tube feeds, and she is c diff negative."

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's current vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.2 C, heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 111/60 to 133/77 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a FiO2 of 50% and PEEP of 7 cmH2O. The patient is tolerating tube feeds well but may require a tracheostomy for comfort. Her laboratory results show leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate levels. The patient is being treated for PCP pneumonia, CMV infection, MSSA bacteremia, and potential endocarditis. Goals include weaning off ventilation, managing fluid balance, treating infections, and addressing anemia and leukopenia. The patient has a history of breast cancer with metastasis, and pain and anxiety are also being managed. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS and PCP pneumonia.
2. Infection-related complications such as sepsis or endocarditis.
3. Bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and possible platelet dysfunction.

   pneumonia and ARDS.
   #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -patient currently on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP- [**Name10 (NameIs) 2945**] on
   this regimen
   -continue IV solumedrol at current dose
   -LDH improving, continue to trend
   -repeat glucan still pending, will be helpful in trending
   -back on PCV but now tolerating FiO2 of 50% and minute ventilation is
   about 10 L/min
   -PaO2 141 on FiO2 of 50%, decrease to 40% and repeat ABG to see if
   patient tolerates a lower setting
   # CMV: VL  greater than 100,000.  Started Gancyclovir.
   -follow CMV viral load q week, + initially on [**5-16**], repeat on [**5-22**]
   -ophtho consult - NO evidence of CMV retinitis
   -still treat for prolonged course given diarrhea, possibly related to
   CMV and would qualify for end organ damage
   -Immunoglobulin quantification added on: IgM and IgA are wnl but IgG is
   low, add on sub classification of IgG
   -discuss with ID role of IVIG
   -diarrhea improving
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -check vanc level
   -on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis, surveillance
   cultures negative
   #Volume:  Goal even today again, do not replete fluid if negative but
   may diurese if negative, patient is currently volume overloaded.
   # Anemia: hct dropped 3 points.
   -given CMV and diarrhea- guiac stool
   -p.m. hct and T&S, transfuse for HCT < 21
   # Leukopenia: most recent chemo was remote [**4-14**].
   -add on granulocyte count
   -may be related to marrow suppression from gancyclovir, within a
   fluctuating range throughout hospital course, continue to trend
   # Pain: on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.  Pain well controlled.
   # Anxiety / depression: qhs ativan 3mg.  standing and prn ativan.
   - Continue celexa 10mg po daily
   #Breast CA: Progressive and metastatic.
   -Defer to onc team
 has shown some response to therapy on basis of
   tumor markers and will likely get palliative chemotherapy pending
   improvement in PCP.
   # Clavicular fracture:  sling, pain well controlled with fentanyl patch
   and gtt and lidocaine patch to clavicular area
   -per radiology read of cxr [**5-18**] ""Right clavicular fracture with apparent
   increased distraction of the fracture fragments; however, may be
   projectional. Clinical correlation
   advised.""  f/u repeat CXR read from [**5-20**].
   # Nutrition: Tolerating tube feeds
   # GI:  c diff negative x 3
   -having diarrhea which is most likely related to CMV however previous C
   diff  was sent in setting of fever w/o diarrhea, new diarrhea, will r/o
   c diff with 3 x c diff.
   -send toxin B if + diarrhea today

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is on pentamidine and caspofungin for PCP treatment. Her current vital signs include a temperature of 37.2 C (99 F), heart rate of 81 bpm, blood pressure of 111/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 27 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. She is receiving mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 600 mL, respiratory rate set at 12 breaths per minute, PEEP of 7 cmH2O, and FiO2 of 50%. The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and abnormal liver function tests. She is receiving IVIG for CMV infection and gancyclovir for CMV pneumonia. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia, and surveillance cultures are negative. She is currently volume overloaded and has a low hematocrit level. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS may lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. CMV Infection: The patient's CMV viral load is high, indicating a potential progression of CMV"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She is now experiencing PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's respiratory failure is due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS. The physician recommends performing a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to rule out CMV pneumonitis and starting ganciclovir treatment if CMV is detected. The patient's ANC is less than 1000, so she has been started on G-CSF to keep the ANC above 1000. The patient also has MSSA bacteremia, and vancomycin levels are being monitored. The patient is diuresed to maintain a negative fluid balance of 500-1000 mL. Anemia and leukopenia are ongoing concerns, with the patient receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as needed. Pain management is controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. Anxiety and depression are being treated with ativan and celexa. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, with plans for palliative chemotherapy pending improvement in PCP. The patient has a clavicular fracture, which is being managed with a sling and pain control. Nutrition is being provided through tube feeds, and the patient has central venous access via a PICC line and arterial line.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, currently on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is intubated and on mechanical ventilation. She is also experiencing diarrhea and has elevated CMV viral load. She has MSSA bacteremia and a clavicular fracture. The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS can lead to respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
2. CMV pneumonitis: The patient's high CMV viral load suggests the possibility of CMV pneumonitis. This can worsen respiratory function and potentially lead to further respiratory failure.
3. Diarrhea: The patient's persistent diarrhea, possibly related to CMV infection, can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Monitoring fluid status and electrolytes is important.
4. MSSA bacteremia: The patient's MSSA bacteremia needs to be treated promptly to prevent complications such as septic shock or endocarditis.
5. Clavicular fracture: The patient's clavicular fracture may require further evaluation and management, including pain control and potential surgical intervention.
6. Anemia and leukopenia: The patient's anemia and leuk"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS and is currently on mechanical ventilation in the ICU. The patient has been tolerating spontaneous breathing trials for short periods of time and is planned for a tracheostomy today. Her ANC is declining despite G-CSF therapy, and there is ongoing diarrhea, but no direct evidence of CMV yet. She is being treated for MSSA bacteremia and has a history of metastatic breast cancer. The patient is also experiencing pain, anxiety, and depression.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Close monitoring of her respiratory status and continued weaning of ventilator settings as tolerated will be important.

2. CMV Pneumonitis: Although the patient's CMV viral load is high, there is no direct evidence of CMV pneumonitis yet. If the BAL results are positive for CMV, treatment with CMV-specific IgG may be necessary.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is being treated for MSSA bacteremia, which could potentially lead to endocarditis. Surveillance cultures should continue to monitor for any changes in bacterial growth.

4. Anemia and Leukopenia: The patient has an"

","Summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

- The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia.
- She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. A BAL was performed to rule out CMV pneumonitis, and cultures are pending.
- The patient is able to wean down on ventilator settings to PSV but continues to be too volume overloaded for safe extubation. A plan for tracheostomy has been made for today.
- She is being treated for PCP with pentamidine and IV steroids, and her LDH levels are improving. Diuretics will be continued to manage fluid overload.
- The patient has a CMV viral load greater than 100,000, and gancyclovir therapy has been initiated. CMV viral load results are pending.
- She has leukopenia, most likely due to recent chemotherapy and marrow suppression caused by gancyclovir. Foscarnet will be started today.
- The patient has MSSA bacteremia and is receiving vancomycin. Surveillance cultures are negative.
- Her volume status is negative 2L since yesterday with lasix 20mg IV X2.
- She also has anemia, pain well controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl, anxiety/depression managed with ativan and celexa, and a history of breast"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient has been treated with various medications including gancyclovir, foscarnet, vancomycin, and pentamidine for her conditions. She is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. Her white blood cell count is low, and she is experiencing diarrhea. She has a history of breast cancer that is progressive and metastatic. The patient also has a clavicular fracture. She is tolerating tube feeds but will need a tracheostomy.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
2. Possible CMV pneumonitis, indicated by high viral load.
3. Bacteremia, initially caused by MSSA.
4. Leukopenia, likely related to marrow suppression from chemotherapy or gancyclovir.
5. Anemia, which is stable but requires monitoring.
6. Pain, well controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.
7. Anxiety/depression, being managed with Ativan and citalopram.
8. Clavicular fracture with distraction of the fracture fragments.
9. Risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
10. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobility.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently on invasive ventilation and has been receiving various medications including gancyclovir, pentamidine, caspofungin, vancomycin, foscarnet, cefipime, furosemide, midazolam, fentanyl, and lorazepam.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure.
2. CMV Infection: The patient has a high viral load of CMV, indicating a potential risk of complications related to CMV infection.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is being treated for MSSA bacteremia, which could lead to complications such as sepsis or endocarditis if not effectively managed.
4. Anemia: The patient has a trend of declining hemoglobin levels, indicating possible anemia that needs to be monitored and managed.
5. Leukopenia: The patient is experiencing neutropenia due to gancyclovir treatment, which increases the risk of infections.
6. Clavicular Fracture: The patient has a clavicular fracture, which may require immobilization and pain management.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure. Close monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.

2. CMV Infection: The patient has a high viral load for CMV, indicating an active infection. Monitoring for signs of CMV pneumonitis or other complications is essential.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has bacteremia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). Surveillance cultures should be monitored, and appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued.

4. Neutropenia: The patient has significant neutropenia due to recent chemotherapy and gancyclovir treatment. Close monitoring of blood counts and switching to foscarnet will help manage this complication.

5. Anemia: The patient's anemia should be monitored and managed appropriately.

6. Pain Management: The patient's pain is well-controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. Regular reassessment of pain levels is necessary.

7. Anxiety/Depression: The patient is being treated for anxiety and depression. Emotional support and appropriate medication"

   Disposition:ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently receiving various medications including pentamidine for PCP, steroids for her breast cancer, and antiviral medications such as ganciclovir and foscarnet for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided include:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Steroid-induced side effects: The patient is on steroids for her breast cancer, which can have side effects such as immunosuppression, increased risk of infection, and fluid retention.
3. Endocarditis: The patient has bacteremia and is being treated with vancomycin for possible endocarditis. This condition involves infection of the heart valves and requires prompt treatment.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's recent chemotherapy may have caused leukopenia, which is a decrease in white blood cell count. This increases the risk of infections.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs close monitoring and management.
6. Pain management: The patient is on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl for pain control. Ensuring adequate pain management is important to prevent"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient is currently receiving treatment for PCP pneumonia, including pentamidine and steroids. She is also on foscarnet for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and vancomycin for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia.

The patient has leukopenia due to recent chemotherapy and is being treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). She also has anemia and is being managed accordingly. Her pain is well-controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. She is tolerating tube feeds and has shown some response to therapy based on tumor markers.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.
2. CMV infection: The patient has a high viral load of CMV, indicating a potential severe infection that requires close monitoring and further treatment.
3. MSSA bacteremia: Although the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia, there is a risk of complications such as endocarditis, especially if the bacteria spread to the heart.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count increases the risk of infections. Close monitoring and management with G-CSF are necessary.
5. Anemia: The patient's ongoing trend of anemia needs to be closely monitored and managed accordingly.
6. Clavicular fracture: The patient has a clavicular fracture, which may cause pain and limited mobility. Proper pain management and immobilization are important to prevent complications.
7. Nutrition: The patient is tolerating tube feeds, but ongoing monitoring of her nutritional status is essential for her overall recovery.

Overall, the patient's condition requires careful management of her respiratory distress, infections, and other comorbidities. Close monitoring and appropriate treatment are necessary to prevent potential complications and improve her health progress."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented to the ICU with septic shock, MSSA bacteremia, PCP pneumonia, and ARDS, CMV viremia. She has been intubated and mechanically ventilated for prolonged periods. The patient is neutropenic and has developed a fever. She requires a tracheostomy for comfort and to facilitate weaning off the ventilator. She is massively volume overloaded and has difficulty diuresing due to large volume loads from medications. Her creatinine levels need to be closely monitored. The patient also has a high viral load of CMV and is being treated with foscarnet. She has MSSA bacteremia and is on vancomycin for presumed endocarditis. The rest of her issues are noted in the resident's notes. The patient's ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control, and prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcers, and VAP. The patient's husband has been informed, and her disposition is to remain in the ICU. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube (ETT) increases the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and ventilator-induced lung injury.
2. Neutropenia: The patient's low white blood cell count (WBC) makes her more susceptible to infections. Her neutrop"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is on multiple medications including pentamidine, prednisone, foscarnet, vancomycin, and G-CSF. Her current concerns include respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and ARDS, CMV infection with moderate diarrhea, MSSA bacteremia, leukopenia, altered mental status, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, thrush, metastatic breast cancer, clavicular fracture, and nutrition.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not properly managed.

2. CMV Infection: The patient's viral load is greater than 100,000, indicating a significant CMV infection. If not treated promptly and effectively, this can lead to further complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding or disseminated disease.

3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is on a 6-week course of vancomycin for possible endocarditis. If the infection persists or worsens, it can lead to septic shock and other systemic complications.

4. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may increase the risk of infections. It is important to monitor her ANC and adjust treatment"

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and CMV infection. She has been diagnosed with ARDS and is currently receiving mechanical ventilation. The patient's condition has been complicated by increased confusion and agitation, pulling out her OG tube, MSSA bacteremia with suspected SBE, and pain control issues. She is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, and other ICU medications. Her vital signs are stable, but she remains critically ill.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's initial chief complaint and ongoing condition is respiratory failure. The ARDS may continue to progress, leading to further respiratory compromise.
2. Infection: The patient has PCP pneumonia, CMV infection, and MSSA bacteremia. These infections could worsen, leading to sepsis or multi-organ dysfunction.
3. Sepsis: With the presence of MSSA bacteremia and potential SBE, the patient is at risk for developing sepsis. Close monitoring of vital signs and infection parameters is crucial.
4. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): As the patient is on mechanical ventilation, there is a risk of developing VAP. Measures such as elevating the head of bed, performing daily wake-up calls, and assessing respiratory system infection parameters are important.
5. Gastrointestinal Bleeding: The patient has been on ant"

   Assessment and Plan
   61F with PMH metastatic breast CA on steroids, s/p third cycle doxil
   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia now with PCP
   pneumonia and ARDS.
    #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -last day of pentamidine is today, [**6-1**]
   -on [**6-2**] decrease prednisone 5mg daily
   -add on LFTs/amylase/lipase
   -volume overload- diurese with Lasix drip goal I/O negative 1 liter per
   day- restart lasix drip when more awake and BP can tolerate
   -schedule trach as ANC without much improvement
   # Acid Base: Metabolic alkylosis with respiratory compromise,
   ventilation switched to AC.  Recheck ABG while on this.
   -primary disturbance seems to be metabolic alkylosis- possibly due to
   diuresis, NG tube not to continuous suction
   -continue to monitor alkylsosis during diuresis
   # CMV: VL  greater than 100,000.
   -repeat VL pending
   -continue foscarnet and [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -f/u ganciclovir resistance testing - pending
   -per ID plan to start cytogam, d/w pharmacy
 possibly available on
   Monday
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis, surveillance
   cultures negative
   - continue 6 week course, establish end date
   # Leukopenia: most recent chemo was remote [**4-14**].
   -likely due to gancyclovir or possibly due to CMV
   -GCSF 480sc daily
   -switched to foscarnet
   -f/u daily ANC
 70 today
   - add cytogam with hope that if CMV is causing bone marrow suppression,
   more aggressive treatment wil help her counts  recove
   # Altered mental status: somnolent since ativan this a.m.
   #. Anemia: continue to trend daily
   -stable
   # Pain: on fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.  Pain well controlled.
   # Anxiety / depression:
   -prn ativan
   -Continue celexa
   - seroquel qhs
   # Thrush:
   - started nystatin
   #Breast CA: Progressive and metastatic.
   -F/U Onc recs
   # Clavicular fracture:  sling, pain well controlled with fentanyl patch

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current medications include steroids, doxil, pentamidine, foscarnet, vancomycin, and ganciclovir. 

Potential medical complications that can arise from the patient's conditions include respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and ARDS, metabolic alkalosis, volume overload, leukopenia, altered mental status, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, thrush, and clavicular fracture. 

The patient's laboratory results show leukopenia, metabolic alkalosis, and altered liver function tests. The microbiology results indicate negative C. difficile toxin assay. 

The patient's plan of care includes managing respiratory failure by adjusting ventilation settings, addressing metabolic alkalosis, treating MSSA bacteremia with vancomycin, managing leukopenia with G-CSF and cytogam, addressing altered mental status, managing anemia, controlling pain, treating anxiety/depression, addressing thrush, and managing the clavicular fracture."

   -last day of pentamidine is [**6-2**], d/c caspo on same day
   -on [**6-2**] decrease prednisone 5mg daily
   -add on LFTs/amylase/lipase
   -volume overload- diurese with Lasix drip goal I/O negative 1 liter per
   day- restart lasix drip when more awake and BP can tolerate
   -schedule trach as ANC without much improvement, Thoracics resident
   will d/w Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] scheduling tomorrow or Wednesday
   # Acid Base: Metabolic alkylosis with respiratory compromise,
   ventilation switched to AC.
   -decrease rate to 18 from 22.
   -recheck ABG, may be able to decrease FiO2 as well
   -primary disturbance seems to be metabolic alkylosis- possibly due to
   diuresis, NG tube not to continuous suction
   -continue to monitor alkylsosis during diuresis
   # CMV: VL  greater than 100,000.
   -repeat VL pending

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's condition has not improved despite receiving pentamidine and decreasing prednisone dosage. She requires mechanical ventilation and has metabolic alkalosis due to diuresis. The patient also has cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, leukopenia, altered mental status, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, thrush, and a clavicular fracture. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk of respiratory failure.
2. Metabolic alkalosis: The patient's ventilation has been switched to assist-control mode, and there is a plan to decrease FiO2 as well.
3. CMV infection: The patient has CMV viremia and is receiving foscarnet treatment. There is a possibility of ganciclovir resistance.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's low white blood cell count may be due to ganciclovir or possibly due to CMV infection.
5. Endocarditis: The patient is being treated with vancomycin for possible endocarditis,"

   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia now with PCP
   pneumonia and ARDS.
    .
    #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -Pt completed course of caspofungin and pentamadine
   -Continue prednisone taper
 taper to 5mg todau
   -LFTs/amylase/lipase - stable
   -Volume overload- diurese with Lasix drip goal I/O negative 1 liter per
   day
   -Plan for tracheostomy today as ANC without much improvement
    .
   # CMV: VL  trending down with foscarnet therapy
   -repeat VL 21K
   -continue foscarnet and [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -f/u ganciclovir resistance testing - pending
   -Continue cytogam for 3 doses
   .
   . # Acid Base: Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compromise,
   ventilation switched to AC.
   - monitor ABG and adjust vent as needed, currently tolerating rate of
   18 and PEEP of 7 well, plan to rest overnight post trach
   -primary disturbance seems to be metabolic alkylosis- likely due to
   diuresis
   -continue to monitor alkylsosis during diuresis
   .
   # Hypoglycemia
 pt requiring frequent D50 for hypoglycemia over past
   24 hours. She has had TF held for trach placement. Pentamidine may also
   be contributing to hypoglycemia.
   -          restart TF tomorrow, if pt fails S&S eval
   -          continue D50 PRN, will add D10 as KVO infusion
   -          Pentamidine to stop today
   -          Consider adrenal insufficiency however pt has received long
   steroid taper, less likely cause
   .
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis, surveillance
   cultures negative
   - continue 6 week course
   .
   # Leukopenia: most recent chemo was remote [**4-14**].
   -likely due to gancyclovir or possibly due to CMV
   -GCSF 480sc daily
   -switched to foscarnet as ganciclovir thought to be contributing to
   leukopenia
   -f/u daily ANC
   - continue cytogam with hope that if CMV is causing bone marrow
   suppression, more aggressive treatment wil help her counts  recover

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She is currently diagnosed with PCP pneumonia, ARDS, and CMV viremia. The patient's condition is stable, but she has several medical complications that need to be addressed.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
2. CMV infection with a viral load trending down with foscarnet therapy.
3. Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compromise, possibly due to diuresis.
4. Hypoglycemia, possibly related to pentamidine and TF holding.
5. MSSA bacteremia, being treated with vancomycin.
6. Leukopenia, possibly due to ganciclovir or CMV infection.
7. Anemia, stable at present.
8. Anxiety/depression, managed with medication.
9. Thrush, treated with nystatin.
10. Breast cancer, progressive and metastatic.
11. Clavicular fracture, managed with a sling and pain control.
12. Nutrition issues, tolerating tube feeds but with concerns about PEG placement.

Overall, the patient's main concerns revolve around respiratory failure, CMV infection, metabolic alkalosis, hypoglycemia, MSSA bacteremia, leukopenia, and anxiety/depression. Close monitoring and appropriate"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 82 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 60-115 mmHg, respiratory rate of 23 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 98%. The patient is intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS, which is causing severe respiratory distress.
2. Acid-Base Imbalance: The patient has metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compromise, likely due to diuresis and NG tube not on continuous suction.
3. CMV Infection: The patient's CMV viral load is greater than 100,000, indicating a significant CMV infection.
4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, and she is being treated with vancomycin for possible endocarditis.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which could be due to gancyclovir or possibly due to CMV.
6. Altered Mental Status: The patient has altered mental status, possibly related to the use of Ativan.
7. Anemia: The patient has anemia that is stable.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has completed courses of caspofungin and pentamadine, and is currently being treated for PCP pneumonia, ARDS, CMV infection, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient has experienced respiratory failure, metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compromise, hypoglycemia, leukopenia, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, thrush, and a clavicular fracture. She is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, steroids, and pain management. The patient's current condition includes being intubated on CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode, receiving supplemental oxygen, and undergoing various diagnostic tests and treatments. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for ongoing respiratory failure. Continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation and ventilation support is crucial.
2. Metabolic Alkalosis: The patient has metabolic alkalosis, which may lead to complications such as muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, and confusion. Correction of acid-base balance is necessary.
3. Hypoglycemia: Frequent hypoglycemic episodes require close monitoring and administration of D50 as needed. TF should be restarted if the patient fails S&S evaluation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS, for which she received treatment with caspofungin and pentamadine. The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on ventilatory support with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7°C (99.9°F), blood pressure ranging from 115/95 to 130/95 mmHg, heart rate of 87 bpm, respiratory rate of 7-30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Her current medications include Enoxaparin (Lovenox), Dextrose 50%, and other ICU medications. The patient has no known drug allergies.

Lab results show a white blood cell count of 0.6 K/uL, hemoglobin of 5.8 g/dL, platelet count of 80 K/uL, blood urea nitrogen of 34 mg/dL, creatinine of 0.2 mg/dL, sodium of 134 mEq/L, potassium of 2.9 mEq/L, and glucose of 73 mg/dL. Imaging studies reveal evidence of clavicular fracture and possible CMV colitis.

   Patient is critically ill
","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a critically ill individual with respiratory failure. They underwent a tracheostomy yesterday and experienced post-procedural hypoxemia, which improved with suctioning. Currently, the patient is overventilated with a pH of 7.52. The plan includes changing to pressure support ventilation (PSV), increasing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to counter derecruitment from the previous day, and continuing to diurese as blood pressure allows.

The patient is being treated for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with vancomycin. Previously, they were on caspofungin and pentamidine, which have been completed. Cefepime will be continued until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is greater than 500 and the patient is afebrile for 48 hours. Foscarnet and cytomegalovirus (CMV) immune globulin will be given for CMV, with a decreasing viral load.

A feeding tube (FT) placement with intermittent rossette (IR) assistance today is planned, followed by starting total parenteral nutrition (TF). The timing of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement will be discussed with surgery.

The patient is also experiencing hypoglycemia, likely due to lack of tube feeds, steroid taper, organ dysfunction, and pentamidine. It is recommended to start tube feeds post-NGT placement and provide dextrose (D5) in the meantime.

Leukopenia and anemia are present, with an improving ANC. The plan includes continuing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and transfusing 1 unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs), aiming for a hematocrit (HCT) level greater than 21%.

ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control, lines management, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis with low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention. The patient's code status is full code, and their disposition remains in the ICU."

   Patient is critically ill
","The patient is a critically ill individual who has undergone various medical interventions. The chief complaint is not explicitly stated in the provided information. The patient has undergone a tracheostomy and is currently experiencing hypoxemia, which improved after suctioning. The patient is being ventilated with an excessive amount of air, as indicated by a pH of 7.52.

The patient is diagnosed with respiratory failure, ID (infection), FEN (feeding), hypoglycemia, leukopenia/anemia, and other conditions such as DVT (deep vein thrombosis) prophylaxis, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and VAP (ventilator-associated pneumonia) prevention.

The patient is receiving multiple medications including antibiotics for MSSA bacteremia, caspofungin, cefepime, foscarnet, cytogam, and others. The patient's blood glucose levels are low, and the plan is to start tube feeds once the nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is successful.

The patient's white blood cell count and hemoglobin levels are low, indicating leukopenia and anemia. The patient's kidney function appears to be normal, with creatinine levels within the normal range. The patient's electrolyte levels are also within the normal range.

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/70 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per"

   61F with PMH metastatic breast CA on steroids, s/p third cycle doxil
   [**4-14**], presented with septic shock, AMS, and bacteremia now with PCP
   pneumonia and ARDS.
    #Repiratory failure: PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS.
   -Pt completed course of caspofungin and pentamadine
   -switch pred to solumedrol 4mg daily as is NPO and continue to taper
   -s/p trach
   -S+S eval
   # CMV: VL  trending down with foscarnet therapy
   -repeat VL 21K
   -continue foscarnet and [**Hospital1 **] lytes
   -f/u ganciclovir resistance testing - pending
   -Continue cytogam for 3 doses
   -decrease RR to 12, goal of switching to pressure support, Increase
   PEEP to 10 and decrease TV to 300, monitor sats with PEEP of 10, ?
   decrease FiO2 to 40% from 50%.
   # Acid Base: Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory compromise,
   ventilation switched to AC.
   -pH  7.52, to help correct acid base could hypoventilate with TV of
   300- she is breathing over vent set at 18 breathing at 26
   -volume overload- goal I/O even to negative 500cc today as Cr up to 0.3
   -send urine lytes for ?ARF
   # Hypoglycemia
 pt requiring frequent D50 for hypoglycemia over past
   24 hours. She has had TF held for trach placement. Pentamidine may also
   be contributing to hypoglycemia however this has now been stopped,
   continue to check q2 hour FS
   - restart TF tomorrow, if pt fails S&S eval
   - D10 as KVO infusion
   #MSSA bacteremia: TTE negative, unable to perform TEE.
   -on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis, surveillance
   cultures negative
   - continue 6 week course
   # Leukopenia: ANC improving, continue GCSF for 3 days over 1000
   -daily ANC
   -continue cytogam and foscarnet
   #. Anemia: continue to trend daily
   -transfuse 1 unit this a.m. and post tx hct this p.m., give 10mg IV

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient has completed courses of caspofungin and pentamadine. She is being treated with foscarnet for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and her viral load is trending down. The patient's respiratory support has been switched to pressure support, and her FiO2 has been decreased to 40%. She requires frequent dextrose 50% infusions due to hypoglycemia. The patient has leukopenia, anemia, and is at risk for further infections. She is also experiencing pain, anxiety, depression, thrush, and has a clavicular fracture. The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic. She is receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition and is neutropenic. Her PICC line is in place for access.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS puts her at risk for continued respiratory failure.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient's frequent dextrose infusions indicate ongoing hypoglycemia, which needs to be closely monitored and managed.
3. Infection: The patient's leukopenia"

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She is now diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She has completed courses of caspofungin and pentamadine. She is currently on mechanical ventilation with pressure support ventilation (PSV) at a pressure of 14 cmH2O and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 10 cmH2O. Her vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5°C, heart rate of 88 bpm, blood pressure of 124/72 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Her labs show leukopenia, anemia, and hypoglycemia. She has ongoing issues with CMV infection, MSSA bacteremia, pain, anxiety/depression, thrush, and a clavicular fracture. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic. She is being managed with supportive care and multiple medications.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's PCP pneumonia has complicated into ARDS, which can lead to respiratory failure if not managed properly.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient requires frequent D50 for hypoglycemia, and the etiology is unclear. This could potentially lead to further complications if not addressed.
3. CMV infection: The patient is being treated for CMV infection, but there is a possibility of resistance or recurrence.
4. MSSA bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which may require a prolonged course of antibiotics and monitoring for endocarditis.
5. Leukopenia: The patient has leukopenia, which increases the risk of infections. Continued monitoring and potential adjustment of immunosuppressive medications may be necessary.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia is likely worsened by phlebotomy and may require further management, such as blood transfusions.
7. Breast cancer progression: Despite supportive care, the patient's breast cancer continues to progress and metastasize, which can lead to further complications and decline in overall health.

Please note that this summary and potential medical complications are based on the provided information and may not encompass all aspects of the patient's condition."

","Based on the provided progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient has been treated with pentamidine and caspofungin.

The patient was previously tolerating pressure support ventilation (PSV) but developed anxiety and increased respiratory rate overnight. She also has metabolic alkalosis and respiratory alkalosis. The decision was made to sedate the patient and place her on assisted control ventilation (AC) with a fixed rate to hypoventilate and correct the pH. An arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and chest X-ray (CXR) were ordered.

The patient's CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy. Further CMV viral load testing is pending, and foscarnet therapy will continue along with monitoring of hospital electrolytes. Cytogam will be continued for three doses, as the patient has already received 18 doses.

The patient's hypoglycemia is resolving, and the dextrose 10% in water (D10) KVO has been changed to dextrose 5% in water (D5). Fingerstick glucose monitoring will continue.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient was previously tolerating pressure support ventilation but developed anxiety and increased respiratory rate overnight.

The plan is to sedate the patient and place her on assisted ventilation with a fixed rate to correct the pH. Additional tests include an ABG and CXR. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's current condition of ARDS and PCP pneumonia puts her at high risk for respiratory failure. Close monitoring and intervention will be necessary to support her respiratory function.
2. Hypoglycemia: The patient has been experiencing hypoglycemia, which is resolving. It is important to continue monitoring fingersticks and adjust the dextrose infusion as needed.
3. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient is being treated with vancomycin for possible endocarditis. Regular surveillance cultures and ongoing treatment will be necessary to prevent complications associated with MSSA bacteremia.
4. Leukopenia: The patient's leukopenia has resolved after stopping gancyclovir and initiating G-CSF. Continued monitoring of white blood cell count will be essential to ensure recovery.

The patient's fever spiked overnight after receiving cytogam, and cultures were sent. Cefepime was restarted due to the fever, and Flagyl was added because of the patient's recent PEG placement.

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient experienced a spike in temperature overnight after receiving cytogam, and cultures were sent. Cefepime was restarted due to the acute change in clinical status, but it was later discontinued as cultures are expected to be unrevealing and the patient is no longer neutropenic. 

The patient also developed hematuria, which was confirmed with a urine analysis. There is no evidence of a urinary tract infection, and the hematuria is likely secondary to metastatic disease or the passing of a kidney stone. 

The patient's respiratory failure is due to PCP pneumonia complicated by ARDS. She has completed her course of treatment with pentamidine and caspofungin. Steroids have been discontinued, and she is on assisted ventilation with ABG monitoring. 

The patient's CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy, and she will continue with this treatment. Only half of the third dose of cytogam infusion was administered. 

The patient has hyperglycemia, which has been addressed by restarting RISS. She also has MSSA bacteremia, for which she is receiving 1g of vancomycin every 12 hours. Surveillance cultures have been negative. 

The patient's leukopenia has resolved with the stopping of gancyclovir and G-CSF. Her anemia is stable and will be monitored daily. Thrombocytopenia is unclear in etiology, with suspicion of bone marrow involvement. Counts are stable, and follow-up is planned. 

The patient experiences pain secondary to clavicular and rib fractures, which is well controlled with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl. She also has anxiety and depression, for which she is given Ativan as needed and will restart citalopram once PEG placement is complete. 

The patient has thrush, which is being treated with nystatin. Her breast cancer is progressive and metastatic, with ongoing supportive management. 

The patient has a clavicular fracture, for which she is using a sling and receiving pain control with fentanyl patch and gtt/lidocaine patch. 

Nutrition management involves PEG placement, and tube feeds will be started 24 hours after placement. A nutrition consult has been requested. 

The patient has PICC line access and is on full code status."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer, admitted for MSSA bacteremia. She has a prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS, chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia. The patient's fever may be related to cytogam infusion, but other concerning symptoms include tachypnea and increased somnolence. The patient's hematuria has resolved, but she remains tachypneic and shows signs of central respiratory failure. The patient is also experiencing CMV viremia and MSSA bacteremia. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient is at risk for further infections due to her immunocompromised state and prolonged hospital stay. Close monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, is essential.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen if not adequately managed. Continuous monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation parameters is necessary.
3. Hemodynamic Instability: The patient's blood pressure fluctuations indicate potential hemodynamic instability. Frequent assessment of vital signs and fluid balance is crucial.
4. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, especially considering her history of hematuria and potential use of nephrotoxic medications.
5. Gastrointestinal Complications: The recent PEG placement increases the risk of gastrointestinal complications, such as perforation or bleeding. Regular abdominal exams are recommended."

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted with MSSA bacteremia. She now has a prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia.

The patient's fever may be related to cytogam infusion, and tachypnea and increased somnolence are concerning for infection. The abdominal exam is benign at present. Pan-culture will be followed, and cefepime/flagyl will be held for now and monitored. If the fever persists, it will be restarted. Serial abdominal exams will be given due to the proximity of fever to PEG placement, and if it spikes again, a chest X-ray will be checked.

The patient's hematuria has resolved this morning, and hemolysis labs overnight are negative. Monitoring will be done for now, and a 3-way Foley may be needed.

The patient remains tachypneic and seems to have central respiratory failure. Diuretics will be held until the source of fever is clearer. 

The patient has CMV viremia, and foscarnet has been started. The time course will be discussed with ID. MSSA bacteremia is being treated with vancomycin until June 10th.

In terms of ICU care, the patient is on TPN without lipids, and regular insulin sliding scale is being used for glycemic control. The patient"

","The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been diagnosed with PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently stable and has completed her course of treatment with pentamidine and caspofungin. She also has pulmonary edema and has undergone tracheostomy.

The patient's CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy, and it is planned to discontinue the treatment once the viral load reaches 0 as per ID consultation. The patient's fever is not neutropenic and is being monitored with cultures. Cefepime has been restarted due to fever spikes.

The patient has hypernatremia with a free water deficit of 3 liters, and she will receive 250cc free water flushes every 4 hours along with electrolyte replacement. The patient has hypercalcemia, which is likely related to her underlying malignancy and is considered a poor prognostic sign. Calcium replacement has been initiated, and bisphosphonates will be started for management.

The patient has hyperglycemia, which has been managed by restarting RISS (regular insulin sliding scale). She also has MSSA bacteremia, for which she is being treated with 1g of vancomycin every 12 hours for possible endocarditis. Surveillance cultures are negative, and a 6-week course of vancomycin"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with metastatic breast cancer admitted with MSSA bacteremia,
   now with prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and
   chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, febrile neutropenia.
   1.) Fever: Recurrent fever today. Likely NOT related to cytogam
   infusion, concern is for infection.  Potential sources include PICC
   infection, PNA (although no significant change in secretions/CXR), UTI,
   sinuses.  No obvious skin source.  Other possibility includes adrenal
   insufficiency although steroid taper was very slow.
       -F/u Pan-Culture
       -Send C diff
       -Will try to place peripherals and pull PICC line
       -Start cefepime for GNR coverage.  If culture neg at 48 hours, will
   tailor
       -Serial abdominal exams given proximity of fever to PEG placement.
   Exam benign this AM.
       -Check [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
       -If initial w/u unrevealing, will broaden search to include
   sinuses.
    2.) Hematuria:  No further episodes yesterday
      -Monitor for now.
    3.) Respiratory Failure:  Remains tachypneic.  Seems to be central in
   nature.
      -Will hold on diuresis today until source of fever clearer.
    4.) CMV Viremia:
       -Per ID, will continue on Foscarnet until VL is 0.
    5.) MSSA Bacteremia:  Vanco until [**6-10**]
   6.) Abnormal CBC:  Likely erroneous specimen
                               -Repeat CBC.
    7.) FEN:  -Phos/K repletion on Foscarnet
                  -OK to use PEG
                  -Free water boluses in PEG for hypernatremia.
                  -Check ionized calcium

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted with MSSA bacteremia. She now has a prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia. The patient's current condition includes a fever, hematuria, respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and MSSA bacteremia. The patient remains tachypneic and seems to have central respiratory failure. She is on various medications including foscarnet, vancomycin, cefepime, lorazepam, famotidine, furosemide, enoxaparin, and fentanyl. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit, heart rate of 121 beats per minute, blood pressure ranging from 108/62 to 127/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 96%. The patient's lab results indicate leukopenia with a white blood cell count of 2.8 K/uL and thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 84. Imaging shows unchanged lung fields with a PICC line appearing to be in the axillary vein. Microbiology samples are being sent for analysis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has a fever, which could be due to an ongoing infection such as a PIC"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with metastatic breast cancer admitted with MSSA bacteremia,
   now with prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and
   chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, febrile neutropenia.
   1.) Fever: Recurrent fever today. Likely NOT related to cytogam
   infusion, concern is for infection.  Potential sources include PICC
   infection, PNA (although no significant change in secretions/CXR), UTI,
   sinuses.  No obvious skin source.  Other possibility includes adrenal
   insufficiency although steroid taper was very slow.
       -F/u Pan-Culture
       -Send C diff
       -Will try to place peripherals and pull PICC line
       -Start cefepime for GNR coverage.  If culture neg at 48 hours, will
   tailor
       -Serial abdominal exams given proximity of fever to PEG placement.
   Exam benign this AM.
       -Check [**Last Name (un) 45**] stim
       -If initial w/u unrevealing, will broaden search to include
   sinuses.
    2.) Hematuria:  No further episodes yesterday
      -Monitor for now.
    3.) Respiratory Failure:  Remains tachypneic.  Seems to be central in
   nature.
      -Will hold on diuresis today until source of fever clearer.
    4.) CMV Viremia:
       -Per ID, will continue on Foscarnet until VL is 0.
    5.) MSSA Bacteremia:  Vanco until [**6-10**]
   6.) Abnormal CBC:  Likely erroneous specimen
                               -Repeat CBC.
    7.) FEN:  -Phos/K repletion on Foscarnet
                  -OK to use PEG
                  -Free water boluses in PEG for hypernatremia.
                  -Check ionized calcium

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who was admitted for MSSA bacteremia and is now experiencing prolonged hospitalization complications such as PCP with ARDS, chronic respiratory failure, and CMV viremia. The patient has had recurrent fevers, likely due to an infection source or adrenal insufficiency. The plan includes sending pan-culture, checking C. difficile, trying to place peripheral IV lines, pulling the PICC line, starting cefepime for GNR coverage, and monitoring for hematuria. The patient remains tachypneic with central respiratory failure, and diuretic therapy has been held until the source of fever is clearer. The patient is being treated with foscarnet for CMV viremia, vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia, and other medications for various conditions. The patient's abnormal CBC is likely due to an erroneous specimen and will be repeated. The patient's nutritional support includes receiving Nutren 2.0 and glycemic control with regular insulin. The patient has multiple lines, including a PICC line, and is on prophylaxis for DVT and stress ulcers. The patient has a DNR/DNI code status and is currently in the ICU."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, presenting with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. The patient has been treated for PCP pneumonia and ARDS. Currently, the patient is experiencing respiratory failure, possibly due to airway trauma from suctioning. The patient's CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy. The patient has a fever, and further investigation is needed to determine the cause, including obtaining peripheral IV access. The patient also has hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and hyperglycemia. 

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's respiratory failure may worsen due to airway trauma from suctioning.
2. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has MSSA bacteremia, which may lead to further complications if not appropriately treated.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's high sodium levels may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Hypercalcemia: The patient's high calcium levels may indicate a poor prognosis, especially if related to underlying malignancy.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient's high blood sugar levels may increase the risk of infection and delay wound healing.
6. CMV Infection: Although the patient's CMV viral load is trending down, there is still a risk of complications associated with CMV infection.
7. Anxiety/Depression: The patient"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been treated for PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, CMV infection, fever, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, leukopenia, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, breast cancer, clavicular fracture, and nutritional support.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient's oxygen saturation levels are around 90% with a PEEP of 5, indicating potential respiratory distress. There are also watery bloody secretions, which could be due to airway trauma from suctioning.
2. CMV infection: The patient's viral load (VL) is trending down with foscarnet therapy, but it is still elevated. Repeat VL should be done on [**6-9**] and monitored regularly.
3. Fever: The patient has a fever despite being on Vanc (vancomycin). This raises suspicion of a possible PICC line infection or other sources of infection.
4. Hypernatremia: The patient has a free water deficit of 2.8 liters, and free water flushes should be given every 4 hours. She has received NS (normal saline) for hypercalcemia, but it may be better to use D5 1/2NS instead of NS.
5. Hypercalcemia: This is likely related to the underlying malignancy, which is a poor prognostic sign. Fluid and lasix should be used prn, and bisphosphonate therapy should be considered if unable to control with fluid and lasix.
6. Hyperglycemia: The patient's blood glucose levels are elevated. Restarting RISS (regular insulin sliding scale) may help in maintaining glycemic control.
7. MSSA bacteremia: The patient is on 1g q12hrs of vancomycin for possible endocarditis. Surveillance cultures are negative, but a 6-week course of treatment is recommended.
8. Leukopenia: The patient's white blood cell count is low, possibly due to stopping gancyclovir and treatment with G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) has resolved the issue.
9. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin levels are trending daily but remain stable.
10. Pain: The patient has pain secondary to clavicular and rib fractures. Fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl provide good pain control.
11. Anxiety/depression: The patient is experiencing anxiety and depression, and lorazepam (Ativan) can be given prn for anxiety. Celexa should be restarted once PEG (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy) is placed.
12. Breast cancer: The patient's breast cancer is progressive and metastatic. Supportive management"

   90% with a PEEP of 5.
   -while on PEEP of 5 seemed uncomfortable and O2 sat 90%, required
   increased suctioning, with watery bloody secretions now, possibly due
   to airway trauma from suctioning.
   -maintain plts > 50
   -repeat CXR this a.m.
   -volume status, goal even given fevers
   # CMV: VL  trending down with foscarnet therapy (d/c after VL is 0 per
   ID)
   -repeat VL 7,000 down from 21,000- repeat VL on [**6-9**] (and q5 days)
   -contact ID prn
   -d/c further cytogam

   sterods
   -s/p trach, on pressure support of [**11-23**] and is sating 95%, was sating
   90% with a PEEP of 5.
   -while on PEEP of 5 seemed uncomfortable and O2 sat 90%, required
   increased suctioning, with watery bloody secretions now, possibly due
   to airway trauma from suctioning.
   -maintain plts > 50
   -repeat CXR this a.m.
   -volume status, goal even given fevers
   # CMV: VL  trending down with foscarnet therapy (d/c after VL is 0 per
   ID)
   -repeat VL 7,000 down from 21,000- repeat VL on [**6-9**] (and q5 days)
   -contact ID prn
   -d/c further cytogam

   once has two peripherals d/c PICC and culture tip
   -given ? bloody secretions repeat CXR
   -not being covered for anaerobes or fungal coverage
   -blood cultures and mycolitic fungal cultures sent, in addition glucan
   and galactomannan (fungal studies) for this a.m.
   # Hypernatremia: Free water deficit 2.8 liters, continue 250cc free
   water flushes q4hrs, rec'd NS for hypercalcemia x 1.5 liters, attempt
   to use D5 1/2NS rather than NS.
   # Hypercalcemia: likely related to underlying malignancy, poor
   prognostic sign if related to malignancy

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently admitted to the ICU for septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). The patient has been treated for PCP with caspofungin and pentamidine, as well as steroids.

The patient's current condition includes respiratory failure, possibly due to ARDS, and ongoing oxygenation issues despite being on pressure support and increased PEEP. The patient's secretions have become bloody and watery, indicating potential airway trauma from suctioning.

The patient also has an active viral load of cytomegalovirus (CMV) which is trending down with foscarnet therapy. Repeat viral load testing is scheduled to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment.

The patient is experiencing fever, possibly due to a central line infection, and blood cultures have been sent to identify the causative organism. Additionally, the patient has hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, and hyperglycemia, which are being managed with appropriate treatments.

Other medical conditions and plans include MSSA bacteremia treated with vancomycin, leukopenia resolved after stopping gancyclovir and G-CSF administration, anemia management, pain control with fentanyl patch, anxiety/depression management with ativan and citalopram, ongoing treatment for metastatic breast cancer, clavicular fracture management, and nutrition support via PEG"

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with metastatic breast cancer admitted with MSSA bacteremia,
   now with prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and
   chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, febrile neutropenia.
   1.) Fever: Recurrent fever today. Likely NOT related to cytogam
   infusion, concern is for infection.  Potential sources include PICC
   infection, PNA (although no significant change in secretions/CXR), UTI,
   sinuses.  No obvious skin source.
       -F/u Pan-Culture
       -Send C diff
       -Will try to replace PICC line
       -Start cefepime for GNR coverage.  If culture neg at 48 hours, will
   tailor
       -Serial abdominal exams given proximity of fever to PEG placement.
   Exam benign this AM.
       -Consider broadening search to include sinuses.
    2.) Hematuria:  No further episodes yesterday
      -Monitor for now.
    3.) Respiratory Failure:  Remains tachypneic.  Seems to be central in
   nature.
      -Will hold on diuresis today until source of fever clearer.
      - Now with trach/PEG
      - Check ABg, increase pain meds
      - Consider change to A-C with pain meds to control tachypnea
   consequent to pain
      - Hemoptysis resolved
    4.) CMV Viremia:
       -Per ID, will continue on Foscarnet until VL is 0.
    5.) MSSA Bacteremia:  Vanco until [**6-10**]
    6) FEN:  -Phos/K repletion on Foscarnet
                  -OK to use PEG
                  -Free water boluses in PEG for hypernatremia.
                  -Check ionized calcium

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 61-year-old female with widely metastatic breast cancer who is currently on chronic vent with an inability to wean.
- She continues to spike with high potassium and magnesium requirements.
- The patient has been experiencing fever and has been diagnosed with MSSA bacteremia, PCP with ARDS and chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia.
- There are concerns about potential sources of infection such as PICC line infection, PNA, UTI, and sinuses.
- The patient's respiratory failure remains tachypneic, and there is a plan to check ABG, increase pain meds, and consider changing to A-C with pain meds to control tachypnea.
- The patient is currently on Foscarnet for CMV viremia and Vancomycin for MSSA bacteremia.
- Other medical issues include hematuria, hypercalcemia, and hypernatremia.
- The patient is critically ill and has a DNR/DNI code status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has recurrent fever and is at risk for further infections, particularly due to the presence of a PICC line and potential sources of infection such as the sinuses.
2. Respiratory Failure: The patient remains tachypneic and may develop further complications related to her ARDS and chronic respiratory failure.
3. CMV Viremia: The patient"

She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, CMV infection, fever, hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, MSSA bacteremia, leukopenia, anemia, pain, anxiety/depression, metastatic breast cancer, and a clavicular fracture.

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the information provided are:

1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): The patient is currently on volume A/C and has a history of PCP pneumonia. This increases the risk of developing VAP.

2. Central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI): The patient had a PICC line that was stopped due to the possibility of infection. The line was eventually removed.

3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is immobilized due to clavicular fractures and has a history of malignancy, which increases her risk of developing DVT.

4. Pressure ulcers: The patient is bedridden and at risk for developing pressure ulcers.

5. Nosocomial infections: Due to her prolonged stay in the ICU and invasive procedures, the patient is at risk for acquiring other nosocomial infections.

   Assessment and Plan
   61 yo F with metastatic breast cancer admitted with MSSA bacteremia,
   now with prolonged hospital course complicated by PCP with ARDS and
   chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, febrile neutropenia.
   1.) Fever: Recurrent fever today. Likely NOT related to cytogam
   infusion, concern is for infection.  Potential sources include PICC
   infection, PNA (although no significant change in secretions/CXR), UTI,
   sinuses.  No obvious skin source.
       -F/u Pan-Culture
       - PICC pulled
       -Serial abdominal exams given proximity of fever to PEG placement.
   Exam benign this AM.
    2.) Hematuria:  No further episodes yesterday
      -Monitor for now.
    3.) Respiratory Failure
      -Will diuresis today given CXR/exam - shoot for 1 liter negative
      - Now with trach/PEG
      - On A-C with pain meds tachypnea better controlled - no plan to
   wean
    4.) CMV Viremia:
        -Per ID, will continue on Foscarnet until VL is 0.
    5.) MSSA Bacteremia:  Vanco until [**6-10**]
    6.) FEN:  -Phos/K repletion on Foscarnet
                   -OK to use PEG
                   -Free water boluses in PEG for hypernatremia.
                   -Check ionized calcium

   Patient is critically ill
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 61-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer who has been admitted to the ICU with MSSA bacteremia. She has a prolonged hospital course complicated by pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic respiratory failure, CMV viremia, and febrile neutropenia.

The patient's current condition includes:

1. Fever: The patient has recurrent fever today, which is likely not related to the cytogam infusion. Potential sources of infection include PICC line infection, pneumonia, urinary tract infection (UTI), or sinuses. A pan-culture will be followed, and the PICC line will be pulled.

2. Hematuria: There have been no further episodes of hematuria yesterday. Monitoring will continue for now.

3. Respiratory Failure: The patient will undergo diuresis today due to worsening infiltrates on the chest X-ray. She will continue to be on assisted ventilation and will not be weaned off.

4. CMV Viremia: The patient will continue on Foscarnet until the viral load is zero, as per the Infectious Disease (ID) consultation.

5. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient will continue to receive Vancomycin until June 10th.

6. FEN: The patient's electrolytes need to be repleted, and it is okay to use percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. Free water"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient underwent tracheostomy placement and is currently on volume-assisted ventilation. She is being treated with foscarnet for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and Lasix for fluid management.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure due to ARDS and PCP pneumonia.
2. CMV infection with a decreasing viral load under foscarnet therapy.
3. Fever of unknown origin, possibly due to an ongoing infection.
4. Hypercalcemia, likely related to underlying malignancy.
5. Hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy for glycemic control.
6. Anemia requiring ongoing monitoring and management.
7. Pain secondary to clavicular and rib fractures, managed with fentanyl patch and IV fentanyl.
8. Anxiety and depression, managed with prn ativan.
9. Progressive metastatic breast cancer requiring supportive management and follow-up with hematology/oncology.
10. Malnutrition, managed with PEG placement and tube feeds.
11. Risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility.
12. Stress ulcer prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
13. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) prevention and management."

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She has been treated for PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, CMV infection, fever, hyperglycemia, anemia, pain from clavicular and rib fractures, anxiety/depression, metastatic breast cancer, and malnutrition. The patient has been started on tube feeds and is being closely monitored for her fluid status and electrolyte balance.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is already experiencing respiratory failure due to PCP pneumonia and ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function if not adequately managed.
2. CMV infection: The patient is being treated with foscarnet for CMV infection. If the treatment is not effective, there is a potential for the infection to worsen.
3. Fever: The patient's fever has not been resolved despite antibiotic therapy. Further evaluation and management are required to identify the underlying cause and prevent any potential complications.
4. Hyperglycemia: The patient has poorly controlled blood glucose levels. If left unmanaged, hyperglycemia can lead to various complications such as infections, poor wound healing, and increased risk of mortality.
5. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be closely monitored and managed appropriately. Severe anemia can result in inadequate oxygen"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a history of metastatic breast cancer, currently on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She now has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient underwent tracheostomy and is on volume-assisted ventilation. She is complaining of cough and requires suctioning. Her HCT is 19.1, and she will be transfused with 1 unit of red blood cells. The patient's CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy. She is also being monitored for fever, hyperglycemia, pain, anxiety/depression, breast cancer, and nutrition. The patient has a PICC line placed and is receiving various medications including fentanyl, famotidine, enoxaparin, and others.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome), which can lead to severe respiratory failure. Close monitoring and management of the patient's ventilation settings are crucial.
2. Anemia: The patient's HCT (hematocrit) level is 19.1%, indicating anemia. Transfusion of red blood cells is planned to address this issue.
3. CMV Infection: The patient is being treated for CMV (cytomegalovirus) infection with foscarnet therapy. Monitoring the CMV viral load is essential to assess the effectiveness of the"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 67-year-old female with a chief complaint of metastatic breast cancer. She is currently experiencing respiratory failure and has been unable to wean off the ventilator. The patient has a history of hematuria, CMV viremia, MSSA bacteremia, and renal failure. She is currently being treated with antibiotics, antivirals, and supportive care measures.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient's inability to wean off the ventilator indicates ongoing respiratory failure. This can lead to further complications such as pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), or barotrauma.
2. Hematuria: Although the patient had an episode of hematuria, it has since resolved. However, if it recurs or persists, it could indicate a urinary tract infection or other renal pathology.
3. CMV Viremia: The patient has been treated for CMV viremia with foscarnet, and the viral load is expected to be undetectable soon. However, if the viral load does not decrease or if there is a relapse, it could lead to further complications related to CMV infection.
4. MSSA Bacteremia: The patient has been treated for MSSA bacteremia and vancomycin was discontinued yesterday. If the infection persists or recurs, it may lead to sepsis or other complications related to MSSA infection.

","Summary:
The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She was treated for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's current conditions include respiratory failure, CMV infection, hypernatremia, anemia, hyperglycemia, pain from clavicular and rib fractures, anxiety/depression, progressive metastatic breast cancer, and PEG tube placement.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is still experiencing persistent respiratory failure despite treatment for PCP and ARDS. There is a risk of further deterioration in respiratory function.

2. CMV Infection: The patient has a CMV viral load of 2050 copies/ml, indicating an ongoing CMV infection. If left untreated or inadequately treated, this could lead to worsening of the patient's condition.

3. Hypernatremia: The patient has a high sodium level of 147, which may increase the risk of neurological complications such as seizures or cerebral edema if not managed appropriately.

4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is at 22.6, indicating anemia. This could contribute to fatigue, weakness, and compromised oxygen delivery to tissues.

5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has elevated blood glucose levels, which may increase the risk of infections and delay wound healing.

6. Pain Management: The patient has pain due to clavicular and rib fractures. Effective pain management is crucial to prevent further complications such as pneumonia or deep vein thrombosis.

7. Anxiety/Depression: The patient is experiencing anxiety and depression, which may impact her recovery and overall well-being.

8. Metastatic Breast Cancer: The patient's breast cancer is progressing and metastasized. The focus will be on providing supportive management and palliative care.

9. PEG Tube Placement: The patient has a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube for nutrition. Complications such as aspiration pneumonia or tube dislodgement should be monitored for.

10. Fluid Balance: The patient has positive fluid balance, which needs to be carefully managed to prevent fluid overload and related complications.

11. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at an increased risk for DVT due to immobility and malignancy. Prophylactic measures should be continued.

12. Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (VAP): The patient's prolonged mechanical ventilation increases the risk of developing VAP. Monitoring and appropriate antibiotic therapy will be necessary.

Overall, the patient's complex medical condition requires close monitoring and management of multiple potential complications to optimize her recovery and quality of life."

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 61-year-old female with a medical history of metastatic breast cancer on steroids, who presented with septic shock, altered mental status, and bacteremia. She also has PCP pneumonia and ARDS. The patient is currently receiving treatment for PCP with caspofungin and pentamidine, as well as steroids. Her CMV viral load is trending down with foscarnet therapy.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient has been treated for PCP pneumonia and ARDS. She may continue to experience respiratory failure if the treatment is not effective or if she develops any complications.
2. CMV: The patient's CMV viral load is currently at 2050 copies/ml. If this continues to increase or does not decrease significantly, it may indicate treatment failure and potential complications related to CMV infection.
3. Hypernatremia: The patient's sodium level is elevated at 147. If not managed properly, this can lead to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.
4. Anemia: The patient's Hct level is at 22.6, indicating anemia. If left untreated or unmanaged, this can lead to decreased oxygen delivery to tissues and potential organ dysfunction.
5. Hyperglycemia: The patient has hyperglycemia, which if not controlled, can increase the risk of infections and other complications.
6. Pain: The patient has secondary pain due to"
