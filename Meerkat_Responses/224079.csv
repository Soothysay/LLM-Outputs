   Assessment and Plan
   26yo woman with back abscess and first episode of DKA.
 DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS (DKA)
   Thought to be due to back abscess in setting of new diagnosis of
   diabetes.  Intra-abdominal process, ischemia less likely.
   -          anion gap now closed
   -          continue insulin gtt and D5 1/2NS while patient is NPO
   -          after extubating, assess patient
s ability to take POs and
   advance diet gently
   -          once eating, would start subcutaneous long-acting insulin
   and then stop insulin gtt 2 hours later
   -          would continue D5 1/2NS at 200cc/hr given persistent
   tachycardia
   -          monitor Q1H FS while on insulin gtt
   -          monitor lytes Q4H and replete K and phos as needed
   -          appreciate [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult
 RESPIRATORY FAILURE, ACUTE (NOT ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])
   Excellent RSBI this AM; anticipate that patient will no longer need
   ventilatory support given that her underlying process (extreme
   metabolic acidosis) is improving.
   -          continue to wean sedation and aim for extubation today if
   doing well
 WOUND INFECTION:
   -          f/u wound Cx from here and from OSH
   -          f/u imaging of upper back to confirm no gas in soft tissues
   -          appreciate surgery recommendations
   -          treating empirically with unasyn and vanc for broad coverage
   -          follow blood cultures
 LIVER FUNCTION ABNORMALITIES:  resolved; most likely from DKA
   -          monitor abdominal exam as sedation is weaned
   -          defer CT abdomen and pelvis unless patient clinically
   worsens or has pain on abdominal exam
 HYPOTHYROIDISM:
   -          continue levoxyl
   -      check TSH given tachycardia

   Code status: Full code
   Disposition: ICU
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 26-year-old woman with a history of diabetes who was admitted to the ICU for suspected respiratory failure and sepsis secondary to a back abscess. She was also diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is being treated with insulin and intravenous fluids.

The patient's current medical conditions include:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient has closed anion gap, indicating improvement, and is receiving insulin and intravenous fluids. After extubation, she will be assessed for her ability to take oral medications and advance her diet gradually.
2. Acute Respiratory Failure - The patient's RSBI is excellent, indicating that she may no longer need ventilatory support. Weaning of sedation will be continued, and extubation is planned for today if she does well.
3. Wound Infection - The patient's wound culture will be followed up from the current location and OSH. Imaging of the upper back will be performed to confirm no gas in the soft tissues. Broad coverage with Unasyn and vancomycin is being administered empirically, and blood cultures are being followed.
4. Liver Function Abnormalities - These have resolved and were most likely due to DKA. The patient's abdominal exam will be monitored as sedation is weaned, and a CT abdomen and pelvis will only be done if the patient clinically worsens or experiences pain on abdominal exam.
5. Hypothyroidism - The patient is currently on Levoxyl, and her TSH levels will be checked due to tachycardia.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Recurrence of DKA if insulin therapy is not managed properly.
2. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to prolonged mechanical ventilation.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism due to immobility and central venous catheters.
4. Wound infection or abscess formation due to inadequate antibiotic therapy or poor wound care.
5. Liver dysfunction or failure if the patient's condition worsens.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical response to treatment. Regular assessment and adjustment of insulin therapy, weaning of ventilatory support, and monitoring for potential complications will be crucial for the patient's recovery."

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese female admitted to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She is currently receiving insulin, antibiotics, and other medications. Her vital signs show tachycardia, tachypnea, and elevated blood pressure. She is on mechanical ventilation with CPAP/PSV mode and has an improved pH. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission, with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hyperglycemia. The flowsheet data indicates adequate fluid balance, respiratory support, and hemodynamic monitoring. The physical examination reveals an overweight-obese appearance, normal heart sounds, clear breath sounds, soft non-tender abdomen, and trace edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory results show elevated WBC count, decreased hemoglobin, prolonged PT/PTT, increased TCO2, decreased albumin, and abnormal liver function tests. The assessment and plan include management of DKA, respiratory failure, wound infection, and liver function abnormalities. The patient is also on prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's wound culture and blood cultures were obtained, indicating concern for possible infections. Given her immunocompromised state due to DKA and mechanical ventilation, she is at increased risk for developing hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

","The patient is currently in the ICU for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). They are being administered a continuous insulin drip and receiving nutrition. The patient's respiratory failure is also being managed, with plans for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and potential extubation if they appear to be doing well. A wound infection has been identified, and a follow-up CT scan is planned to check for any gas in the area, which may indicate an abscess. Liver function abnormalities are resolving, and it is expected that imaging will not be necessary once the patient is off sedation and extubated.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:

1. Hypoglycemia: Due to the administration of insulin, there is a risk of low blood sugar levels.

2. Hyperglycemia: Although the patient is currently in DKA, there is still a risk of high blood sugar levels due to their underlying diabetes.

3. Infection: The wound infection and the presence of an arterial line increase the risk of further infections.

4. Respiratory distress: The patient's acute respiratory failure could potentially worsen, leading to difficulties in breathing.

5. Liver dysfunction: Although the liver function abnormalities are resolving, there is still a risk of complications related to the liver.

6. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient is receiving prophylaxis for DVT, but there is still a risk of blood clots forming in the deep veins.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old overweight/obese female with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has been admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and insulin drip management. She underwent surgery, which was followed by wound infection concerns. There are also liver function abnormalities, but they are resolving. The patient's vital signs show fever, tachycardia, and tachypnea. Her arterial blood gas (ABG) indicates anion gap closing and improved pH on mechanical ventilation. The patient is receiving multiple IV medications including insulin, vancomycin, famotidine, propofol, and subcutaneous heparin. She has trace edema in both lower extremities and has not been assessed for skin, neurologic, or right radial pulse.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's surgical wound is suspected to have an infection. There is a plan for a back CT scan to look for gas, which could indicate an abscess or other complications.
2. Respiratory failure: The patient is currently on mechanical ventilation due to acute respiratory failure. If her blood gases improve during a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), she may be extubated.
3. Liver function abnormalities: Although the patient's liver function tests are resolving, close monitoring is recommended, especially when she is extubated and off sedation.

","Summary:
The patient is a 65-year-old individual admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has been receiving treatment for DKA, which includes insulin infusions and fluid resuscitation. They also have a wound infection and are being treated with antibiotics. The patient's thyroid function is abnormal, indicating hypothyroidism. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate between 112-127 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/76 mmHg to 139/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21-31 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. The patient is extubated and taking sips by evening, with a closed airway gap. Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels, slightly low potassium, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal ranges. The patient is on various medications, including famotidine, heparin sodium, and insulin.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Hypoglycemia: Insulin therapy used to treat DKA can lead to low blood sugar levels, especially if the insulin dosage is not carefully monitored.
2. Infection: The patient already has a wound infection, and there is a risk of developing additional infections due to the invasive lines and procedures in the ICU.
3. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Immobility and central venous catheters increase the risk of"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old woman who was admitted to the ICU for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has a new diagnosis of diabetes and also has a right upper back abscess. The cause of her diabetes is unclear, as she may have Type 1, Type 2, or possibly Flatbush diabetic. Her DKA has been treated with subcutaneous insulin and she is now advancing her diet as tolerated. Her wound infection is being covered with antibiotics until the sensitivities are available, and she will continue to have dressing changes as recommended by surgery. She also has tachycardia, infiltrates on chest X-ray and CT chest, and elevated liver function tests. She is being treated with levoxyl for hypothyroidism, which was previously normal. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Aspiration pneumonia: The patient is at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to her recent intubation at the outside hospital. This risk is further increased by the infiltrates seen on her chest X-ray and CT chest.
2. Pneumonia: The infiltrates on her chest X-ray and CT chest could indicate pneumonia, especially since she is not currently showing significant cough or fever.
3. Necrotizing fasciitis: Although the CT scan does not show evidence of necrotizing fasciitis, there is a mild amount of soft tissue stranding surrounding the area of the abscess. This suggests that there may be inflammation in the sub"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient was admitted to the ICU and received treatment for DKA, including insulin infusions and fluid resuscitation. The patient's arterial line was stopped, and they were successfully extubated without any complications.

The patient has a wound infection on their back, which was identified as being caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotics were started, and sensitivity testing is pending.

The patient's vital signs show tachycardia with a heart rate of 112 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 109/76 mmHg to 139/89 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 94%. The patient's temperature is within normal limits.

The patient's lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin levels, and normal platelet count. Liver enzymes and kidney function tests are within normal limits. Blood glucose levels are elevated, indicating uncontrolled diabetes.

Imaging studies reveal ill-defined opacities in the upper lobes of the lungs, suggestive of aspiration or pneumonia. A CT scan shows multifocal areas of consolidation in both lung fields, along with sub-6-mm foci of attenuation at the right apex. There is also a defect in the subcutaneous tissues of the midline right upper back with packing material inside, but no evidence of necrotizing fasciitis. Additionally"

","The patient is a 26-year-old woman admitted with very severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) requiring intubation due to acidosis. She has now improved significantly, is extubated, and is eating.

Potential medical complications that can arise from the information provided in the progress note include:

1. Infection: The patient has a neck abscess/wound infection and is currently on appropriate antibiotics. There is a need to follow up with sensitivities and discuss with surgery about potentially narrowing coverage. This indicates a risk of ongoing or recurrent infection.

2. Hypothyroidism: The patient has been checked for TSH to exclude iatrogenic hyperthyroidism. This suggests that there might be a concern about the patient's thyroid function being affected by medication or treatment.

3. Tachycardia: The patient has a rapid heart rate (tachycardia) which is likely related to hypovolemia. The healthcare team will attempt a significant volume challenge to address this issue. If there is no response, they will need to assess for other potential causes of tachycardia.

4. Atelectasis vs. Pneumonia: The patient's CT scan shows dependent pulmonary opacities, which could be indicative of atelectasis or pneumonia. If the patient develops fever, bandemia, or leukocytosis, the healthcare team may need to treat broadly for possible infection.

5. DKA: The patient has very severe DKA"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient, a 26-year-old woman, was admitted with very severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and required intubation due to acidosis. She has now significantly improved, is extubated, and is eating. The patient's medical history includes diabetes, neck abscess/wound infection, and hypothyroidism. She presented with fatigue, hyperglycemia, and anemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypothyroidism: This condition can lead to various complications, such as weight gain, fatigue, depression, and cold intolerance.
2. DKA: DKA is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar levels, ketones in the urine, and acidosis. It can result in dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and organ damage if not promptly treated.
3. Neck abscess/wound infection: Infections in the neck region can be serious and potentially lead to complications like airway obstruction, spread of infection to surrounding structures, or systemic infection.
4. Tachycardia: The patient's high heart rate may indicate hypovolemia, which can be a result of severe DKA and fluid loss. If not managed properly, it can lead to further complications like poor tissue perfusion and organ dysfunction.

Please note that the above assessment is based on the information provided in the progress note. Further evaluation and diagnostic tests may be necessary to determine the exact medical complications and their severity."

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old male admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a history of wound infection, hypothyroidism, and diabetes. 

24-hour events include starting nafcillin for MSSA wound infection, receiving additional fluid resuscitation due to tachycardia being fluid responsive, experiencing nausea and receiving ondansetron (Zofran), and receiving various antibiotics. 

Vital signs show sinus tachycardia, stable blood pressure, respiratory rate within normal range, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Hemodynamic monitoring shows a positive fluid balance of 412 mL over 24 hours. 

Laboratory results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, and normal creatinine levels. Other lab values are within normal range or not significantly abnormal.

Assessment and plan include diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), wound infection, and hypothyroidism. The patient is receiving regular insulin sliding scale for glycemic control, diabetic diet, prophylactic heparin for DVT, stress ulcer prophylaxis with an H2 blocker, and multi-lumen central venous catheter for medication administration.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA is a serious complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 65-year-old female admitted to the ICU with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient has a history of poor appetite and cough but denies any other significant symptoms. She has been started on nafcillin for MSSA wound infection. Her vital signs show sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 103 bpm and blood pressure ranging from 116/65 to 97/59 mmHg. The patient's respiratory rate is within normal limits, and her oxygen saturation is 94%. Fluid balance shows an input of 5,102 mL and output of 4,690 mL since midnight. The patient's labs indicate hyperglycemia, an elevated white blood cell count, and signs of infection. The patient's wound culture reveals moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus. The assessment and plan include DKA, wound infection, and hypothyroidism. ICU care includes nutrition, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, and prophylactic measures for DVT and stress ulcers.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): The patient is at risk for DVT due to prolonged immobility in the ICU. Prophylactic measures such as low molecular weight heparin have been initiated.
2. Wound Infection: The patient already has a confirmed MSSA infection in the wound, which needs to be treated appropriately with"

","Summary:
The patient is a 26-year-old woman who was admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). She has since been treated and her blood sugar levels have improved. The patient also has a wound infection caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), for which she is receiving nafcillin. She is currently in the ICU and is being monitored closely. The patient's tachycardia is slowly improving, and further investigation into potential causes is ongoing. She will be transferred to the floor once her condition stabilizes.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Wound infection: The patient's wound infection caused by MSSA needs to be closely monitored for any signs of worsening or spreading infection. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should be continued, and regular wound assessments should be performed.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although the patient's blood sugar levels have improved, there is still a risk of DKA recurrence due to her suspected Type 2 diabetes. Close monitoring of her blood glucose levels and prompt intervention if necessary are crucial.
3. Tachycardia: The patient's tachycardia may have been caused by the recent episode of DKA or another underlying condition. Continued monitoring of her heart rate and further investigation to determine the cause are necessary.
4. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): Given the patient's prolonged immobilization during her ICU stay, there is a risk of developing DVT."
