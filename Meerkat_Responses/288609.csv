   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   Embolic Stroke:  Patient presents with right gaze preference, aphasia
   and left sided paralysis.  Per neurology team, CTA is consistent with
   thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Per neurology he is not a
   candidate for TPA given his prior history of intracerebral hemorrhage
   and recent surgery.  He is also not a candidate for intra-aterial TPA
   or mechanical clot removal.  At present the patient appears to be
   protecting his airway and is alert.
   - labetalol titrate to SBP < 200 and > 160
   - will very cautiously administer lasix given pulmonary edema and allow
   blood pressure to autoregulate
   - aspirin 300 mg PR daily
   - patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous surgical
   staples in cranium
   - will keep HOB < 30 degrees or flat as tolerated per neurology
   - tylenol PRN to avoid hyperthermia
   - tight blood glucose control with insulin sliding scale and finger
   sticks with goal of glucose < 150
   - will check hemoglobin A1c and lipid panel for risk factor
   modification
   - q 1-2 hour neurologic checks
   - NPO
   - echocardiogram pending
   - carotid dopplers pending
   Pulmonary Edema:  Unclear etiology.  Most likely related to
   hypertension.  Per anesthesia records patient only received 800 cc IVF
   during procedure.  Currently satting well on 3L NC but exam concerning
   for harsh bilateral rales and tachypnea.
   - 20 mg IV lasix now and will titrate labetalol as needed
   - if signs of respiratory distress low threshold for intubation
   - repeat CXR in AM
   Hypertension:  Patient's blood pressures appear to have ranged form
   140s to 160s as an outpatient.  Unclear etiology of his profound
   hypertension today pre and post-operatively. Patient takes only
   atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - labetalol drip to maintain systolic pressures > 160 and < 200
   Atrial Fibrillation: Currently in sinus rhythm.  Not currently
   anticoagulated given hematuria and wet macular degeneration.  Now s/p
   likely embolic stroke.
   - monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 300 mg PR
   Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection.  Pathology pending.
   Unclear if diagnosis firmly established or presumptive.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation post-operatively
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes post-procedure
   Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
   Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.
   - iron studies
   - likely start oral iron supplementation
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, no IVF
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, previous hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), craniotomy, and recent diagnosis of bladder cancer. The patient underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder yesterday and subsequently had an ischemic stroke.

The patient is currently in the ICU and is unresponsive. He has been given Lasix IV and started on an intermittent labetalol drip to control blood pressure between 160 and 210. The patient is also receiving morphine sulfate for pain management.

Vital signs show a temperature of 36.4Â°C, heart rate of 66 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 127/42 mmHg to 215/123 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on a nasal cannula. The patient has fluid balance showing a negative balance of 647 mL since 12 AM.

The patient's physical examination reveals scleral edema, conjunctival injection, elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), poor dentition, right gaze preference, aphasia, and left-sided paralysis. Neurologic examination shows the patient responding to stimuli but not assessed further due to unresponsiveness.

Lab results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly elevated creatinine levels, and normal electrolyte levels. Imaging studies show a thrombus in the M2 segment of"

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who presented for transurethral bladder resection and post-operative developed left-sided hemi-paresis and eye deviation. The patient was found to have a thrombotic MCA (middle cerebral artery) lesion and is not a candidate for TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) or neurosurgical intervention. The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and has been off coumadin for several weeks.

The patient received a small dose of lasix and labetolol overnight. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature range of 35.7-36.4 degrees Celsius, heart rate range of 66-74 beats per minute, blood pressure range of 127-178/42-123 mmHg, respiratory rate range of 15-19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

The patient's flow sheet data shows a fluid balance of -647 mL and -1,577 mL since 12 AM. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device of a nasal cannula and has an ABG (arterial blood gas) result of 7.43/41/73.[**Numeric Identifier 218**]/28/2.

The patient's physical examination reveals genitourinary, cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, respiratory, abdominal, and neurologic assessments. The patient's labs and radiology results are also documented.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Thrombotic CVA (cerebrovascular accident): The patient already has a thrombotic MCA lesion and is not a candidate for TPA or neurosurgical intervention. This indicates that there may be ongoing neurological damage due to the thrombotic event.
2. Respiratory Distress: The patient is experiencing pulmonary edema likely secondary to hypertension. This condition can lead to further respiratory compromise and potential respiratory failure.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure readings indicate high blood pressure levels, which can increase the risk of further end-organ damage.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation and may continue to experience irregular heart rhythms, increasing the risk of clot formation and potential embolic events.
5. Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI): The patient may have had an associated AMI due to the respiratory distress and hypertension. This can lead to cardiac complications and further deterioration of the patient's condition."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA
   is consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently
   maintaining SBP per neuro recs, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor
   vitals. Echo performed yeserday awaiting final read, on preliminary
   shows pulmonary hypertension. Also will have carotid dopplers today.
   Neurology following. patient cannot receive MRI of the head given
   previous surgical staples in cranium
   - SBP < 200 and > 160, ASA 300 mg PO qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology
   - NPO
   - f/u echo final read
   - carotid dopplers this AM
   -f/u neurology recommendations
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated, currently on AC 450
   RR16 FIO2 40% PEEP 5. CXR this morning appears slightly improved than
   yesterday.
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
   #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   Also concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. Therefore, need to clarify with
   neurology if his BP goals need to be so high.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - telemetry
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria. This is likely etiology of his stroke. He went
   into AF overnight which did not break with 20mg IV lopressor total .
   Patient was started on PO metoprolol which did not resolve arrhythmia.
   Started on amiodarone this morning with improvement in HR. Would
   benefit from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia.
   Currently not candidate for further anticoagulation until resolution of
   hematuria.
   -amiodarone as written, monitor BP
   - ASA, heparin
   #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology for care
   recommendations while in ICU. Patient initially with clear urine but
   progressively more bloody overnight, restarted CBI.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
   #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
   #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - iron studies
   - likely start oral iron supplementation
   #FEN: TF per nutrition recs, IV fluids with care not to overload given
   pulmonary edema, replete electrolytes as needed especially K.
   #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

   MICU Attending Coverage Note
   I saw and examined patient and reviewed the relevant history and labs.
   I was physically present with the ICU team for the key parts of the
   services provided.  I agree with the note above, including assessment
   and plan.  I would emphasize and add the following:
   The patient remains on the ventialator, sedated, with evidence of right
   MCA stroke.  Last night he went into Afib and is now on Amiodarone for
   rate control.  Right IJ inserted.  For now neuro advises no anticoag
   except aspirin, and advises keeping SBP in 160-200 range.
   On exam: Tm= 100.7, p=107 and  irreg, BP=177/77, Sat=99% on vent.  On
   A/C at 40% with 5 Peep.  ABG
s fine.  He responds to tactile stimuli
   only, not verbal.  Left foot plantar reflex present. Lungs
 rhonchi
   and bibasilar crackles Abd soft
   Lab: CBC and lytes as above.  CK = 311 but MB normal (?brain CK). Trop
   decreasing CXR suggests Right pneumonia, but no current CHF
   Problems:
   1.       Bladder cancer
   2.       Right MCA stroke
   3.       Pulm htn on echo

The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presents post-operative from a transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset ischemic stroke. The patient's current condition includes embolic stroke, pulmonary edema, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, bladder cancer, macular degeneration, anemia, and poor nutritional status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Stroke: The patient has had a recent embolic stroke, and there is a risk of further neurological complications.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient has evidence of pulmonary edema, which can lead to respiratory distress and potential cardiac complications.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains elevated, posing a risk for cardiovascular events.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's ongoing atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to prevent thromboembolic events and maintain hemodynamic stability.
5. Bladder Cancer: The patient recently underwent transurethral resection of bladder cancer, and there is a risk of recurrence or progression of the disease.
6. Anemia: The patient's anemia needs to be addressed to improve oxygen carrying capacity and prevent further complications.
7. Malnutrition: The patient's poor nutritional status may contribute to delayed wound healing, infection, and overall poor recovery.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA is
   consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently on BP
   control with labetalol, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor vitals.
   Echo performed yeserday awaiting final read, on preliminary shows
   pulmonary hypertension. Also will have carotid dopplers today.
   Neurology following.
   - labetalol titrate to SBP < 200 and > 160
   - aspirin 300 mg PR daily
   - patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous surgical
   staples in cranium
   - will keep HOB < 30 degrees or flat as tolerated per neurology
   - tylenol PRN to avoid hyperthermia
   - q 1-2 hour neurologic checks
   - NPO
   - f/u echo final read
   - carotid dopplers this AM
   Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. Will follow CXR to
   monitor resolution of volume overload.
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - repeat CXR in AM
   Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - labetalol drip to maintain systolic pressures > 160 and < 200
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria. This is likely etiology of his stroke. He went
   into AF overnight which did not break with 20mg IV lopressor total .
   Patient was started on PO metoprolol which did not resolve arrhythmia.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to consider amiodarone given risk factors.
   -metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid
   - monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 300 mg PR
   Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection.  Pathology pending.
   Unclear if diagnosis firmly established or presumptive.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation post-operatively
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes post-procedure
   Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
   Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.
   - iron studies
   - likely start oral iron supplementation
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, no IVF
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presented post-operative from transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset ischemic stroke. The patient has several medical complications that require attention:

1. Embolic Stroke: The patient had an embolic stroke with a thrombus in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). He is currently being monitored for vital signs and is on blood pressure control with labetalol, aspirin, and an arterial line. An echocardiogram performed yesterday showed pulmonary hypertension, and carotid dopplers will be done today. Neurology follow-up is planned.

2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely has pulmonary edema, which may be related to pulmonary hypertension or flash pulmonary edema during the stroke event. He is intubated, and a chest X-ray will be monitored to track the resolution of volume overload. Lasix 20 mg IV will be given as needed, but blood pressure parameters will be closely monitored.

3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remained within the range set by neurology except during a period of atrial fibrillation while receiving lopressor. His current blood pressure medications include atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient. Labetalol will be administered to maintain systolic pressures >"

","Summary:
The patient is a 60-year-old male who was admitted to the ICU with arterial and multi-lumen lines in place. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.4Â°C, heart rate of 123 bpm, blood pressure of 120/56 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode. The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation. The patient's fluid balance shows an input of 1,027 mL and output of 2,370 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,343 mL. The patient's blood products transfused were 200 mL. The patient's respiratory support includes an endotracheal tube with CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow ventilation mode, set Vt of 450 mL, RR of 16 breaths per minute, PEEP of 5 cmH2O, FiO2 of 40%, RSBI of 106, PIP of 14 cmH2O, and plateau pressure of 13 cmH2O. The patient's arterial blood gas values show pH of 7.46, PaCO2 of 39 mmHg, HCO3- of 26 mEq/L, Na+ of 138 mEq/L, Cl- of 104 mEq/L, K+ of 3.6 mEq/L, and glucose of 121 mg/dL. The patient's physical examination is not assessed due to limited information provided. The patient's lab results indicate a WBC count of 11.6 K/uL, Hct of 30.8%, Plt of 215 K/uL, Cr of 1.2 mg/dL, Troponin-T of 0.10 ng/mL, and other lab values within normal range. The patient's assessment and plan include ICU care, nutrition, glycemic control, lines management, prophylaxis for DVT, stress ulcer, and VAP. The patient's code status is full code, and disposition is not mentioned. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): Due to the prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation, the patient is at risk for developing VAP.
2. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient's immobility and central venous catheter may increase the risk of developing DVT.
3. Stress ulcer: Prolonged ICU stay and use of certain medications may increase the risk of stress-related mucosal disease or stress ulcers.
4. Fluid imbalance: The negative fluid balance indicates ongoing losses that need to be addressed to maintain adequate hydration.
5. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is on the lower side, which may indicate inadequate perfusion and requires monitoring and appropriate interventions.
6. Atrial fibrillation: The patient's heart rhythm is atrial fibrillation, which requires monitoring and management to prevent complications such as stroke or heart failure.
7. Delirium: Prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay can increase the risk of delirium in critically ill patients."

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA is
   consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently on BP
   control with labetalol, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor vitals.
   Echo performed yeserday awaiting final read, on preliminary shows
   pulmonary hypertension. Also will have carotid dopplers today.
   Neurology following.
   - labetalol titrate to SBP < 200 and > 160
   - aspirin 300 mg PR daily
   - patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous surgical
   staples in cranium
   - will keep HOB < 30 degrees or flat as tolerated per neurology
   - tylenol PRN to avoid hyperthermia
   - q 1-2 hour neurologic checks
   - NPO
   - f/u echo final read
   - carotid dopplers this AM
   Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. Will follow CXR to
   monitor resolution of volume overload.
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - repeat CXR in AM
   Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - labetalol drip to maintain systolic pressures > 160 and < 200
   Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria. This is likely etiology of his stroke. He went
   into AF overnight which did not break with 20mg IV lopressor total .
   Patient was started on PO metoprolol which did not resolve arrhythmia.
   [**Month (only) 51**] need to consider amiodarone given risk factors.
   -metoprolol 12.5mg PO bid
   - monitor on telemetry
   - aspirin 300 mg PR
   Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection.  Pathology pending.
    Unclear if diagnosis firmly established or presumptive.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation post-operatively
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes post-procedure
   Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
   Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.
   - iron studies
   - likely start oral iron supplementation
   FEN: NPO for now, replete lytes, no IVF
   Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presents post-operative from a transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset ischemic stroke. The patient's current condition includes arterial line placement, multi-lumen catheter placement, and intubation due to pulmonary edema. He has been diagnosed with embolic stroke, likely related to atrial fibrillation. The patient is currently being monitored for vital signs, neurologic checks, and fluid balance. He is also being treated for pulmonary edema, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Stroke: The patient has already experienced an ischemic stroke, which could lead to further neurological complications such as weakness, speech difficulties, or cognitive impairment.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient is currently being treated for pulmonary edema, which can progress to respiratory failure if not managed appropriately.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully controlled to prevent further complications such as heart attack or stroke.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient's atrial fibrillation needs to be managed to reduce the risk of thrombus formation and potential embolic events.
5. Bladder Cancer: The patient underwent a transurethral resection for bladder cancer, and the pathology results are pending. There is a risk of recurrence"

   Chest x-ray -
   Right IJ catheter terminates in superior vena cava. Endotracheal tube
   terminates at the carina and needs to be pulled back at least 2 cm.
   Nasogastric tube terminates in the stomach. There are multifocal patchy
   airspace opacities throughout the lungs, unchanged, which could reflect
   aspiration or pneumonia. The heart is enlarged. There is superimposed
   mild
   congestive failure.
   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA
   is consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently
   maintaining SBP per neuro recs, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor
   vitals. Echo performed shows EF 45% which is much decreased from
   previous echo in [**2158**] when EF was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left
   systolic dysfunction which is consistent with ischemic event. Evidence
   of pulmonary hyptertenion. no evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers
   with 40% stenosis of right side, left side without significant
   stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous
   surgical staples in cranium
   - SBP < 200 and > 160, ASA 300 mg PR qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology, however with chest x-ray findings are
   concerning for aspiration pneumonia, would like to put head upright to
   prevent furthur aspiration
   - neurologic exam has not improved significantly since admission, no
   intervention was performed
   - maintain NPO for now, will need to readdress nutritional status soon
   - patient likely with MI prior to admission (enzymes on admission
   trended down) but new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and
   pulmonary hypertension
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -f/u neurology recommendations from today
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. CXR this morning
   appears to have evidence of pulmonary infiltrates as well as .
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
   - pressure support trial today then check ABG then goal to extubate
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   Also concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. Therefore, need to clarify with
   neurology if his BP goals need to be so high.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - telemetry
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks
   given presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit
   from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not
   candidate for further anticoagulation until resolution of hematuria.
   - patient started on PO metoprolol as well as amiodarone for persistent
   afib, currently in NSR
   - ASA PR
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment, still need
   input for rate controlling [**Doctor Last Name **] in the setting of persistently
   elevated blood pressure
    #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology for care
   recommendations while in ICU. Patient initially with clear urine but
   progressively more bloody overnight, restarted CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
    #FEN: tube feeds, replete electrolytes as needed.
    #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole

   previous echo in [**2158**] when EF was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left
   systolic dysfunction which is consistent with ischemic event. Evidence
   of pulmonary hyptertenion. no evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers
   with 40% stenosis of right side, left side without significant
   stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous
   surgical staples in cranium
   - SBP < 200 and > 160, ASA 325 mg PO qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology
   - neurologic exam has not improved significantly since admission, no
   intervention was performed
   - NPO
   - patient likely with MI prior to admission (enzymes on admission
   trended down) but new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and
   pulmonary hypertension
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -f/u neurology recommendations
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. CXR this morning
   appears ***************.
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   Also concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. Therefore, need to clarify with
   neurology if his BP goals need to be so high.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - telemetry
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks
   given presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit
   from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not
   candidate for further anticoagulation until resolution of hematuria.
   - patient started on PO metoprolol as well as amiodarone for persistent
   afib
   - ASA, heparin
    #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology for care
   recommendations while in ICU. Patient initially with clear urine but
   progressively more bloody overnight, restarted CBI.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presents post-operative from a transurethral resection of bladder cancer and has experienced a new onset ischemic stroke. The patient is currently intubated and being treated in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic Stroke: The patient has had a new onset ischemic stroke, which was confirmed by a CT angiography showing a thrombus in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery. The patient's neurologic exam has not improved significantly since admission.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely has pulmonary edema, possibly related to pulmonary hypertension or flash pulmonary edema during the stroke event. He is intubated and receiving Lasix as needed.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains within the range set by neurology, except during episodes of atrial fibrillation while receiving Lopressor. The patient takes atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient, but there is concern for an ischemic event due to EKG changes and elevated CK-MB levels.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had not been anticoagulated for three weeks due to presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. He would benefit from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA
   is consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently
   maintaining SBP per neuro recs, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor
   vitals. Echo performed shows EF 45% which is much decreased from
   previous echo in [**2158**] when EF was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left
   systolic dysfunction which is consistent with ischemic event. Evidence
   of pulmonary hyptertenion. no evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers
   with 40% stenosis of right side, left side without significant
   stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous
   surgical staples in cranium
   - SBP < 200 and > 160, ASA 300 mg PR qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology, however with chest x-ray findings are
   concerning for aspiration pneumonia, would like to put head upright to
   prevent furthur aspiration
   - neurologic exam has not improved significantly since admission, no
   intervention was performed
   - maintain NPO for now, will need to readdress nutritional status soon
   - patient likely with MI prior to admission (enzymes on admission
   trended down) but new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and
   pulmonary hypertension
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -f/u neurology recommendations from today
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. CXR this morning
   appears to have evidence of pulmonary infiltrates as well as .
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
   - pressure support trial today then check ABG then goal to extubate
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   Also concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. Therefore, need to clarify with
   neurology if his BP goals need to be so high.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - telemetry
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks
   given presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit
   from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not
   candidate for further anticoagulation until resolution of hematuria.
   - patient started on PO metoprolol as well as amiodarone for persistent
   afib, currently in NSR
   - ASA PR
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment, still need
   input for rate controlling [**Doctor Last Name **] in the setting of persistently
   elevated blood pressure
    #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology for care
   recommendations while in ICU. Patient initially with clear urine but
   progressively more bloody overnight, restarted CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Appreciate neurology recs.  Per neurology team, CTA
   is consistent with thrombus in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently
   maintaining SBP per neuro recs, ASA, and with arterial line to monitor
   vitals. Echo performed shows EF 45% which is much decreased from
   previous echo in [**2158**] when EF was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left
   systolic dysfunction which is consistent with ischemic event. Evidence
   of pulmonary hyptertenion. no evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers
   with 40% stenosis of right side, left side without significant
   stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of the head given previous
   surgical staples in cranium
   - SBP < 200 and > 160, ASA 325 mg PO qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology
   - neurologic exam has not improved significantly since admission, no
   intervention was performed
   - NPO
   - patient likely with MI prior to admission (enzymes on admission
   trended down) but new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and
   pulmonary hypertension
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -f/u neurology recommendations
   #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient is intubated. CXR this morning
   appears ***************.
   - 20 mg IV lasix as needed however monitor for above BP parameters
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology except for
   period of atrial fibrillation w/administration of lopressor- BPs down
   to 140s/70s.  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient.
   Also concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. Therefore, need to clarify with
   neurology if his BP goals need to be so high.
   - lasix 20 mg IV now for pulmonary edema
   - telemetry
    #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks
   given presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit
   from good heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not
   candidate for further anticoagulation until resolution of hematuria.
   - patient started on PO metoprolol as well as amiodarone for persistent
   afib
   - ASA, heparin
    #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology for care
   recommendations while in ICU. Patient initially with clear urine but
   progressively more bloody overnight, restarted CBI.
   - continue continuous bladder irrigation
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
    #FEN: TF per nutrition recs, replete electrolytes as needed especially
   K.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presented post-operative from a transurethral resection of the bladder for bladder cancer and has now developed a new onset ischemic stroke. The patient is currently intubated and in the ICU.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic Stroke: The patient has a thrombus in the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), indicating an embolic stroke. This requires ongoing monitoring and management of blood pressure, anticoagulation, and neurological assessment.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely has pulmonary hypertension and may be at risk for pulmonary edema. Close monitoring of respiratory status and fluid balance is necessary. Diuretics may be required for symptom management.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be carefully managed according to neurology recommendations. There is concern for an ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient had not been anticoagulated due to hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Good heart rate control is needed to avoid demand ischemia. The patient is currently on metoprolol and amiodarone for persistent atrial fibrillation.
5. Bladder Cancer: The patient recently underwent transurethral resection of the bladder and is awaiting pathology"

   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday called neurology as no new notes left in chart. Spoke with
   resident on-call [**Location (un) 41**] who spoke with chief. Reccomended re-imaging with
   repeat head CT for progression of stroke. After repeat imaging, spoke
   again with neurology who said that given size of stroke patient is not
   a candidate for anticoagulation at this time. Also said okay to come
   down on blood pressure goals to 160-180s.  Goal for extubation this AM
   - turn down propofol drip this morning and starting labetalol drip as
   needed for blood pressure management.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Per neurology team, CTA is consistent with thrombus
   in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently maintaining SBP per neuro
   recs, which as of [**8-29**] can be maintained between 160-180s systolic,
   continue ASA, and with arterial line to monitor vitals. Echo performed
   shows EF 45% which is much decreased from previous echo in [**2158**] when EF
   was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left systolic dysfunction which is
   consistent with ischemic event. Evidence of pulmonary hyptertenion. no
   evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers with 40% stenosis of right side,
   left side without significant stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of
   the head given previous surgical staples in cranium. repeat CT scan of
   the head [**8-29**] demonstrates large area of infarct which is confined to
   MCA territory.
   - SBP < 180 and > 160, usually propofol for sedation as well as blood
   pressure control, ASA 300 mg PR qd, HOB < 30 degrees or flat as
   tolerated per neurology, however with chest x-ray findings are
   concerning for aspiration pneumonia, would like to put head upright to
   prevent furthur aspiration, will need to clarify with neurology plan in
   regards to this today
   - no stroke intervention performed, neurologic function is somewhat
   improved, does move left foot intermittently and withdraws to pain,
   albeit inconcistently on left arm
   - difficult to assess full neurologic status given that intubated and
   sedated, however today plan for extubation will be better able to
   assess
   - weaning propofol this AM, using labetalol as needed to keep BP
   160-180s systolic
   - maintain NPO for now as likely extubation this AM, will need to
   readdress nutritional status soon
   - patient likely with previous myocardial insult and also some demand
   ischemia, new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and pulmonary
   hypertension
   - cardiology consult reccomendations to control blood pressure and also
   treat CAD
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -need to page neurology today to discuss plan of care with them again
    #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Patient lung exam sounds much improved
   today. Patient is intubated. Patient given IV lasix on admission to the
   unit for pulmonary hypertension however has not required much in the
   way of additional lasix in last day.
   - f/u CXR for resolution as pt is high risk of aspiration
   - pressure support trial today then check ABG then goal to extubate
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology. Periods of
   atrial fibrillation with RVR, attempted IV lopressor and also diltiazem
   drip (when heart rate was low). Currently off any rate controlling
   [**Doctor Last Name **].  Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient. Also
   concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. However, neurology wants to maintain
   goal blood pressure of 160-180s.
   - continue tight BP monitoring
   - labetalol as needed for blood pressure control
   - once extubated would restart b-blocker at home dose and titrate up as
   tolerated
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit from
   heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not candidate
   for further anticoagulation as evidence of large infarct on repeat CT
   scan.
   - on ASA 325 mg PO daily, not candidate for anticoagulation at this
   time given extent of stroke
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment - on asa and
   statin
    #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology.  Patient initially
   with clear urine but progressively more bloody overnight, restarted
   CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
    #FEN: holding tube feeds with goal for extubation today, replete
   electrolytes as needed.

   previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer and hematuria presents
   post-op from transurethral resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke.
   24 Hour Events:
   Yesterday called neurology as no new notes left in chart. Spoke with
   resident on-call [**Location (un) 41**] who spoke with chief. Reccomended re-imaging with
   repeat head CT for progression of stroke. After repeat imaging, spoke
   again with neurology who said that given size of stroke patient is not
   a candidate for anticoagulation at this time. Also said okay to come
   down on blood pressure goals to 160-180s.  Goal for extubation this AM
   - turn down propofol drip this morning and starting labetalol drip as
   needed for blood pressure management. Patient was extubated this
   morning without complication.

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Per neurology team, CTA is consistent with thrombus
   in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently maintaining SBP per neuro
   recs, which as of [**8-29**] can be maintained between 160-180s systolic,
   continue ASA, and with arterial line to monitor vitals. Echo performed
   shows EF 45% which is much decreased from previous echo in [**2158**] when EF
   was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left systolic dysfunction which is
   consistent with ischemic event. Evidence of pulmonary hyptertenion. no
   evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers with 40% stenosis of right side,
   left side without significant stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of
   the head given previous surgical staples in cranium. repeat CT scan of
   the head [**8-29**] demonstrates large area of infarct which is confined to
   MCA territory.
   - SBP < 180 and > 160, now off propofol for sedation,  using labetalol
   drip for blood pressure control, ASA 300 mg PR qd, HOB < 30 degrees or
   flat as tolerated per neurology, however with chest x-ray findings are
   concerning for aspiration pneumonia, would like to put head upright to
   prevent furthur aspiration, will need to clarify with neurology plan in
   regards to this today
   - no stroke intervention performed, neurologic function is somewhat
   improved, does move left foot intermittently and withdraws to pain,
   albeit inconcistently on left arm
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - will d/c labetalol drip today, start low dose beta blocker, and will
   lower blood pressure parameters now that 72+ hours out of stroke
   - unclear if functionally will be able to [**Last Name (LF) 1080**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need speech
   and [**First Name3 (LF) 1080**] evaluation and then pending this possible peg tube
   placement
   - patient likely with previous myocardial insult and also some demand
   ischemia, new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and pulmonary
   hypertension
   - cardiology consult reccomendations to control blood pressure and also
   treat CAD
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -follow-up new neuro notes
    #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Chest x-ray with much improved edema, and
   now exam much more clear with some wheezing. Patient now extubated.
   Patient given IV lasix on admission to the unit for pulmonary
   hypertension however has not required much in the way of additional
   lasix in last day.
   - continue to follow serial chest x-rays
   - start nebs for wheezing
   - check a post-extubation gas later this evening
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology. Periods of
   atrial fibrillation with RVR, attempted IV lopressor and also diltiazem
   drip. Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient. Also
   concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. However, neurology wants to maintain
   goal blood pressure of 160-180s.
   - as per neuro this morning, can again lower blood pressure goals to
   140-160s
   - d/c dilt drip, start low dose b-blocker with additional PRN as
   tolerated
   - continue tight BP monitoring
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit from
   heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not candidate
   for further anticoagulation as evidence of large infarct on repeat CT
   scan.
   - on ASA 325 mg PO daily, not candidate for anticoagulation at this
   time given extent of stroke
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment - on asa and
   statin
   - re-start beta blocker as above
   #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology.  Patient initially
   with clear urine but progressively more bloody overnight, restarted
   CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
     #FEN: will need speech and [**First Name3 (LF) 1080**] to evaluate whether patient can
   eat post stroke. If not, then will need peg and nutrition recs

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presented post-operative from a transurethral resection for bladder cancer and developed a new onset ischemic stroke. The patient's current condition is stable, and he has been extubated. He has been started on labetalol for blood pressure control and ASA for antiplatelet therapy. The patient's recent laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly decreased hemoglobin, and elevated creatinine levels. His imaging studies reveal evidence of pulmonary hypertension and a large area of infarct confined to the middle cerebral artery territory.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ischemic Stroke: The patient has already experienced an ischemic stroke, and there is a possibility of recurrent strokes due to his risk factors such as atrial fibrillation and carotid artery stenosis.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient's chest x-ray shows evidence of pulmonary edema, which could be related to pulmonary hypertension or a flash pulmonary edema during the stroke event. Monitoring and management of fluid balance will be crucial.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure needs to be closely monitored and managed according to neurology recommendations. There is a risk of further cerebrovascular events if the blood pressure is not controlled.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient has a history of atrial fibrillation"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 yo male with h/o A-fib now presenting post op from bladder resection
   with acute ischemic stroke to ICU.  He has had evolution of significant
   area of insult in right MCA distribution and has, although still
   impaired, some improved mental status and responsiveness allowing move
   to extubation this am.
   Respiratory Failure-
   -Extubated this am
   -Will need pulmonary toiled and npo status to minimze chances or
   re-intubation
   -Will need continued negative fluid balance today given change in
   pressures with extubation
   -Will need to trial bronchodilators to minimize contribution from
   bronchospasm
   -Levofloxacin course to be discontinued with negative cultures to date
   from respiratory standpoint
   Stroke-
   -Does appear embolic by distribution and history of A-fib
   -With follow up CT area of involvement is significant
   -Do have neuro input with advice to avoid systemic anticoagulation
   given risk of hemorrhagic evolution
   -npo, speech and swallow and will have to consider safe route for
   enteral feeding
   -ASA to continue for secondary prevention
   Hypertension-
   -Does have history and indications for maintenance of elevated
   pressures in the immediate post stroke period in the setting of a
   history of hypertension.  Given 48 hours of reasonable support will now
   move to maintain baseline blood pressure.
   -Favor po beta-blocker as possible

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male who presented to the ICU with a history of atrial fibrillation and acute ischemic stroke following a bladder resection surgery. The patient has shown some improvement in mental status and responsiveness, allowing for extubation this morning. However, there are several potential medical complications that need to be addressed.

1. Respiratory Failure:
   - The patient was extubated this morning and will need pulmonary toileting and NPO status to minimize the chances of re-intubation.
   - Continued negative fluid balance is necessary today given the change in pressures with extubation.
   - Trial bronchodilators should be used to minimize contribution from bronchospasm.
   - Levofloxacin course should be discontinued with negative cultures to date from respiratory standpoint.

2. Stroke:
   - The stroke appears to be embolic, given the distribution and history of atrial fibrillation.
   - Follow-up CT shows a significant area of involvement.
   - Neuro input advises against systemic anticoagulation due to the risk of hemorrhagic evolution.
   - The patient will be kept NPO, and speech and swallow will need to be considered for safe enteral feeding.
   - ASA should continue for secondary prevention.

3. Hypertension:
   - The patient has a history of hypertension and indications for maintaining elevated pressures in the immediate post-stroke period.
   - Blood pressure should now be stabilized at baseline levels.
   - A beta-block"

   24 Hour Events:
   -Neurology suggested yesterday re-starting warfarin and continue ASA.
   They believe risk for second stroke is higher due to AF/AFl, lying in
   bed with ASD, than worsening recent stroke with hemorrhage.
   -Patient was successfully extubated yesterday.
   -Patient had episodes with agitation and hypertension. Haldol did not
   help (1mg IV). Labetalol was given for HTN.
   -S&S saw him and failed bedside swallow test. Will re-evaluate today.
   If patient fails will need PEG for long-term nutrition.

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient's chief complaint is a stroke. The patient was previously extubated yesterday and had episodes of agitation and hypertension, which did not respond to Haldol. Labetalol was given for hypertension. The bedside swallow test failed, and the patient may require a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) for long-term nutrition.

The patient has no known drug allergies. They received Levofloxacin on 08/29/2162 at 06:18 PM, Pantoprazole on 08/30/2162 at 08:06 AM, Furosemide on 08/30/2162 at 03:51 PM, Heparin Sodium (prophylaxis) on 08/31/2162 at 06:00 AM, and Metoprolol on 08/31/2162 at 06:00 AM.

The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except as noted below.

Flowsheet data as of 08/31/2162 at 07:07 AM includes vital signs, hemodynamic monitoring, fluid balance, respiratory support, and lab results. The patient's vital signs are within normal range, with a temperature of 37.6 C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 138/50 mmHg to 190/75 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen"

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Per neurology team, CTA is consistent with thrombus
   in the M2 segment of the MCA.  Currently maintaining SBP per neuro
   recs, which as of [**8-29**] can be maintained between 160-180s systolic,
   continue ASA, and with arterial line to monitor vitals. Echo performed
   shows EF 45% which is much decreased from previous echo in [**2158**] when EF
   was 60-70%. Also echo with  regional left systolic dysfunction which is
   consistent with ischemic event. Evidence of pulmonary hyptertenion. no
   evidence of thrombus. carotid dopplers with 40% stenosis of right side,
   left side without significant stenosis. patient cannot receive MRI of
   the head given previous surgical staples in cranium. repeat CT scan of
   the head [**8-29**] demonstrates large area of infarct which is confined to
   MCA territory.
   - SBP < 180 and > 160, now off propofol for sedation,  using labetalol
   drip for blood pressure control, ASA 300 mg PR qd, HOB < 30 degrees or
   flat as tolerated per neurology, however with chest x-ray findings are
   concerning for aspiration pneumonia, would like to put head upright to
   prevent furthur aspiration, will need to clarify with neurology plan in
   regards to this today
   - no stroke intervention performed, neurologic function is somewhat
   improved, does move left foot intermittently and withdraws to pain,
   albeit inconcistently on left arm
   - continue serial neuro exams
   - will d/c labetalol drip today, start low dose beta blocker, and will
   lower blood pressure parameters now that 72+ hours out of stroke
   - unclear if functionally will be able to [**Last Name (LF) 1080**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] will need speech
   and [**First Name3 (LF) 1080**] evaluation and then pending this possible peg tube
   placement
   - patient likely with previous myocardial insult and also some demand
   ischemia, new evidence of regional systolic dysfunction and pulmonary
   hypertension
   - cardiology consult reccomendations to control blood pressure and also
   treat CAD
   - carotid dopplers without acute lesion
   -follow-up new neuro notes
    #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Chest x-ray with much improved edema, and
   now exam much more clear with some wheezing. Patient now extubated.
   Patient given IV lasix on admission to the unit for pulmonary
   hypertension however has not required much in the way of additional
   lasix in last day.
   - continue to follow serial chest x-rays
   - start nebs for wheezing
   - check a post-extubation gas later this evening
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology. Periods of
   atrial fibrillation with RVR, attempted IV lopressor and also diltiazem
   drip. Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient. Also
   concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. However, neurology wants to maintain
   goal blood pressure of 160-180s.
   - as per neuro this morning, can again lower blood pressure goals to
   140-160s
   - d/c dilt drip, start low dose b-blocker with additional PRN as
   tolerated
   - continue tight BP monitoring
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit from
   heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not candidate
   for further anticoagulation as evidence of large infarct on repeat CT
   scan.
   - on ASA 325 mg PO daily, not candidate for anticoagulation at this
   time given extent of stroke
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment - on asa and
   statin
   - re-start beta blocker as above
   #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology.  Patient initially
   with clear urine but progressively more bloody overnight, restarted
   CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
     #FEN: will need speech and [**First Name3 (LF) 1080**] to evaluate whether patient can
   eat post stroke. If not, then will need peg and nutrition recs
     #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole, subQ heparin

   24 Hour Events:
   -Neurology suggested yesterday re-starting warfarin and continue ASA.
   They believe risk for second stroke is higher due to AF/AFl, lying in
   bed with ASD, than worsening recent stroke with hemorrhage.
   -Patient was successfully extubated yesterday.
   -Patient had episodes with agitation and hypertension. Haldol did not

   Assessment and Plan
   85 year old male with PMHx of intermittent afib, previous cerebral
   bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria presents post-op from
   transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with new onset
   ischemic stroke
   #Embolic Stroke:  Patient with stroke in MCA. Improving rapidly; now
   recuperating movement on right side. Patient
s BP now ~160s, currently
   on ASA.
   -SBP target today 140-160
   -Start Warfarin home dose
   S&S eval today; may need NGT
   -F/u neuro recs
    #Pulmonary Edema: Likely related to pulmonary HTN vs. flash pulmonary
   edema during stroke event. Chest x-ray with much improved edema, and
   now exam much more clear with some wheezing. Patient now extubated.
   Patient given IV lasix on admission to the unit for pulmonary
   hypertension however has not required much in the way of additional
   lasix in last day.
   - continue to follow serial chest x-rays
   - start nebs for wheezing
   - check a post-extubation gas later this evening
    #Hypertension:  BPs remained within range set by neurology. Periods of
   atrial fibrillation with RVR, attempted IV lopressor and also diltiazem
   drip. Patient takes only atenolol 50 mg daily as an outpatient. Also
   concern for ischemic event given EKG changes and elevated CE which
   would likely suggest ischemia. However, neurology wants to maintain
   goal blood pressure of 160-180s.
   - as per neuro this morning, can again lower blood pressure goals to
   140-160s
   - d/c dilt drip, start low dose b-blocker with additional PRN as
   tolerated
   - continue tight BP monitoring
   #Atrial Fibrillation: Patient had not been anticoagulated x3weeks given
   presenting hematuria and wet macular degeneration. Would benefit from
   heart rate control to avoid demand ischemia. Currently not candidate
   for further anticoagulation as evidence of large infarct on repeat CT
   scan.
   - on ASA 325 mg PO daily, not candidate for anticoagulation at this
   time given extent of stroke
   - cardiology has been seeing patient, suspect that LV dysfunction from
   CAD, reccomending HTN management as well as CAD treatment - on asa and
   statin
   - re-start beta blocker as above
   #Bladder Cancer:  Now s/p transurethral ressection with pending
   pathology.  Will need to follow up with urology.  Patient initially
   with clear urine but progressively more bloody overnight, restarted
   CBI.
   - d/c continuous bladder irrigation for now, if grossly bloody again,
   would consider restarting as per urolgoy
   - follow with urology
   - repeat electrolytes
    #Macular Degneration:
   - continue eye drops
    #Anemia:  Patient's hematocrit is 33.2 with a MCV of 79 concerning for
   iron deficiency.  Likely secondary to patient
s long-standing hematuria
   but given history of malignancy (both bladder and colon ca) also may be
   playing a role.
   - started on oral iron for iron studies consistent with iron defiency
   anemia
     #FEN: will need speech and swallow to evaluate whether patient can
   eat post stroke. If not, then will need peg and nutrition recs
     #Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, pantoprazole, subQ heparin

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male with a medical history of intermittent atrial fibrillation, previous cerebral bleed, remote colon cancer, and hematuria. He presented post-op from transurethral bladder resection for bladder cancer with a new onset ischemic stroke. The patient's current conditions include embolic stroke, pulmonary edema, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and anemia. He is currently in the ICU and requires close monitoring and management of his conditions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Embolic Stroke: The patient has had an ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. It is important to continue monitoring his neurological status and ensure strict blood pressure control as per neurology recommendations.
2. Pulmonary Edema: The patient likely has pulmonary edema related to pulmonary hypertension or flash pulmonary edema during the stroke event. Close monitoring of respiratory status, serial chest x-rays, and nebs for wheezing are recommended.
3. Hypertension: The patient's blood pressure remains within the range set by neurology. However, there are periods of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Tight blood pressure monitoring and management with appropriate antihypertensive medications are necessary.
4. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is not a candidate for further anticoagulation due to the extent of the stroke. ASA 325 mg PO daily will be continued, and heart rate control should be maintained to avoid demand ischemia.

","Summary:
The patient is an 85-year-old male admitted to the ICU for respiratory failure and ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The patient has been extubated without event and retains significant deficits following the CVA. There is a modest improvement in alertness and responsiveness after extubation.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory Failure: The patient was initially intubated for respiratory failure, and although extubation was successful, there is a risk of recurrent respiratory failure due to ongoing respiratory compromise and aspiration precautions should be maintained.
2. CVA: The patient has retained significant deficits following the ischemic CVA, and ongoing monitoring and management are necessary. Speech and swallow evaluation should be repeated, and blood pressure should be controlled at baseline levels.
3. Atrial Fibrillation: The patient is currently in sinus rhythm but has a history of atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation should be avoided due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.
4. HTN: The patient's blood pressure needs to be controlled with IV medications in the ICU setting.

Other considerations include glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, line management, prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and vigilance for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)."
