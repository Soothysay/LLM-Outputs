","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of hyperglycemia and altered mental status. The patient has a history of diabetes type I, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, depression, and chronic extremity ulcer. The patient's insulin infusion was continued overnight, and the artificial gut was closed in the morning. The patient slept well and had no complaints. 

The patient has allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and latex. The last dose of antibiotics was infusions. The patient is currently on ICU medications and other medications for various conditions. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the following: 

- Respiratory support: The patient is on nasal cannula with SpO2 at 99%. 
- Neurologic: The patient responds appropriately, but movement, tone, and assessment were not evaluated. 

Flowsheet data shows stable vital signs with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/57 to 147/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and SpO2 at 99%. Fluid balance shows an intake of 4 mL in total and output of 1,200 mL in urine. 

The patient has a WBC count of 16.7 K/uL, Hct of 32.1%, Plt of 344 K/uL, Cr of 1.3/1.1 mg/dL, Troponin-T of 0.02 ng/mL, Glucose of 352/131 mg/dL, and other lab results within normal ranges. An imaging test revealed no acute process, with clear lung parenchyma and normal heart size. 

Assessment and Plan:
- The patient is diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and will receive half of their home dose of 75/25 insulin followed by discontinuation of insulin gtt. FSG is 124, and IVF will be changed to D5. Aggressive fluid rate will be continued until the patient takes good PO, then tapered down. Lytes check will be done every day, and potassium will be added to IVF if K drops below 4. An endocrinologist will be consulted.
- The patient's EKG changes are most likely hypovolemic demand strain, and the EKG will be rechecked today. Telemetry was unrevealing overnight, and cardiac enzymes were negative.
- Leukocytosis is resolving, likely related to DKA. Blood cultures will be followed up.
- Nausea/vomiting has resolved, likely due to DKA. Anti-emetics will be given as needed.
- Oral abscess will be treated with clindamycin 150mg qid (since [**3-28**]).
- Diabetes type I is fixed, and SS insulin"

","The patient's chief complaint is hyperglycemia and altered mental status. The patient has been diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which was managed by closing the arteriovenous (AV) shunt and administering half of the home dose of insulin. The patient's fluid balance shows a positive intake of 4 mL and output of 2,312 mL, indicating adequate hydration. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 36.6°C, heart rate of 86 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 140/57 to 147/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 17 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. 

The patient's lab results show elevated blood glucose levels at 352 mg/dL and a white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, suggesting an infection. The ECG shows ST depressions, but cardiac enzymes are negative, indicating no acute cardiac event. Imaging reveals clear lung parenchyma with no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 

The patient's assessment and plan include continuing aggressive fluid resuscitation, checking electrolytes regularly, and monitoring for signs of hypoglycemia after stopping the insulin infusion. The patient will be followed up by an endocrinologist for diabetes management. Additionally, the patient has leukocytosis, which is resolving, and an oral abscess being treated with clindamycin.

","Summary:
The patient is a well-nourished individual with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's medical history, social history, and review of systems are largely unchanged from admission, except for fatigue, blurry vision, conjunctival edema, dry mouth, cough, hyperglycemia, and no history of thyroid disease. The patient has allergies to penicillins, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and latex. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure and normal heart rate. The patient is receiving intravenous fluids and respiratory support through a nasal cannula. Physical examination reveals crackles in the bases of the lungs, an absent right radial pulse, absent left radial pulse, and an extremity ulcer. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose level, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level. The assessment and plan include resolving DKA, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, altered mental status, and chronic extremity ulcer. ICU care includes nutrition support, glycemic control with regular insulin sliding scale, prophylactic measures for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and stress ulcers, and ventilation-associated pneumonia (VAP) precautions.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Acute Renal Failure: The patient's elevated BUN and creatinine levels indicate a possible acute renal failure. This can be a life"

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 75-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient presented with an altered mental status, which was confirmed by his wife. A CT scan of the head showed no evidence of intracranial bleeding or other abnormalities, but there was a scalp hematoma at the vertex. The patient also had signs of dehydration and was found to have troponin leak, suggesting possible demand ischemia or NSTEMI. His blood glucose levels were significantly elevated. The patient was diagnosed with type I diabetes, altered mental status, hyponatremia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, oral abscess, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, DKA, acute renal failure, and chronic extremity ulcer.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Reoccurrence of DKA: The patient's high blood glucose levels indicate ongoing uncontrolled diabetes, which increases the risk of future episodes of DKA.
2. Cardiac Ischemia: The troponin leak and the presence of risk factors such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia suggest potential cardiac ischemia, which could lead to further complications like myocardial infarction.
3. Renal Dysfunction: The patient's history of acute renal failure indicates compromised kidney function. This may lead to chronic kidney disease and the need for dialysis in the future.
4. Foot Ulcer Complications: The patient has a chronic extremity ulcer"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). The patient's wife reports that he is not as sharp as usual since admission and has a scalp hematoma at the vertex. The patient has a history of diabetes, poor dentition, and chronic extremity ulcers. He is currently on heparin sodium, ASA, and BB medications. His review of systems is unchanged from admission, except for nausea and new T wave flattening in inferior leads. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.9°C, heart rate of 71 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 115/53 mmHg to 166/67 mmHg, respiratory rate of 15 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows normal sinus rhythm, and fluid balance is within normal limits. The patient is receiving respiratory support with an oxygen delivery device and has an ABG result of ///22/. Physical examination reveals well-nourished appearance, poor dentition, normocephalic head, crackles in the chest, soft and non-tender abdomen, and absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities. Neurological examination is not assessed due to patient's altered mental status. Lab results indicate elevated blood glucose levels, leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, and altered mental status. Imaging shows a scalp hematoma without evidence of hemorrhage"

","Summary of the Progress Note:
The patient is admitted to the ICU for DKA and is currently on mechanical ventilation due to respiratory failure. The patient has a history of type 1 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and an oral abscess. The patient's wife reported that he is not as sharp as usual since admission, and a CT scan of the head showed a scalp hematoma but no evidence of hemorrhage or other intracranial processes. The patient has leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and renal failure, which have all resolved. He also has chronic extremity ulcers and is being seen by podiatry. The patient's troponin levels are elevated, indicating possible cardiac involvement. He is being treated with heparin, ASA, and a beta-blocker.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Cardiac Complications: The patient's elevated troponin levels suggest possible cardiac involvement, which may indicate ischemia or a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Continuous monitoring and further evaluation are necessary to determine the extent of cardiac involvement and appropriate treatment.
2. Renal Failure: Although the patient's acute renal failure has resolved, there is still a risk of renal impairment due to previous episodes of DKA. Close monitoring of renal function and appropriate management are essential to prevent further complications.
3. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA): While the patient's current episode of DKA has resolved, he has"

","Summary:
The patient is a 71-year-old male with a chief complaint of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He has a history of type I diabetes with complications such as neuropathy, nephropathy, and gastroparesis. The patient presented to the emergency department with profound dehydration and was started on IV fluids. He received lasix for diuresis but had a net negative fluid balance of 116cc as of 11pm.

Assessment and Plan:
1. Troponin leak - Resolved, likely secondary to demand ischemia due to profound dehydration. EKG was reported as normal.
2. Diabetes, type I - Fixed and SS insulin coverage recommended, along with a diabetic diet. FSG every 2 hours but SSI only every 4 hours to avoid hypoglycemia.
3. Altered mental status (not delirium) - Recently oriented x3, not significantly altered. CT head negative for intracranial process.
4. Hyponatremia - Basilar crackles have resolved after administration of lasix. Net positive fluid balance over 9 liters since ED presentation, suggesting hypervolemic hyponatremia. Consider lasix and goal of negative 1000cc today.
5. Anemia - HCT 28 this AM, down from 39 on presentation. Historical baseline is 27-30. Continue guaiac stools.

","Summary:
The patient presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and is now in the ICU for close monitoring. The patient's blood glucose levels have been well-controlled with insulin therapy. There have been no new developments in the patient's condition since admission. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate ranging from 66-83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 103-165/43-96 mmHg, respiratory rate ranging from 13-25 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95%. The patient's hemodynamic monitoring shows a slight negative fluid balance over the past 24 hours.

Medical Complications:
1. Diabetes Type I: The patient has known neuropathy, nephropathy, and gastroparesis associated with diabetes type I. The management includes fixed and sliding-scale insulin coverage, along with dietary recommendations.

2. Troponin leak: The patient experienced a troponin leak, which was likely due to demand ischemia in the setting of profound dehydration. The EKG was reported as normal.

3. Hyponatremia: The patient has hyponatremia, which is likely hypervolemic due to the positive fluid balance since ED presentation. The goal is to administer lasix to achieve a negative fluid balance of 1000cc today and allow for autodiuresis towards eunatremia.

4. Anemia: The patient's HCT has decreased from 39 on presentation to 28"

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old Type I diabetic who presented to the ICU with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). They were not taking insulin due to feeling poorly. The patient was found to be acidotic, with high white blood cell count, and started on an insulin drip. The patient developed worsening nausea and chest pain, and an EKG showed flattening of the T-waves with slight troponin leak of 0.8. The patient was started on a heparin drip and is now stable.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): This is a serious complication of diabetes that occurs when there is a lack of insulin in the body, leading to high blood sugar levels and the production of ketones. DKA can cause metabolic acidosis, electrolyte imbalances, and dehydration.
2. Myocardial infarction (heart attack): The presence of chest pain and elevated troponin levels suggest the possibility of a heart attack. Troponin is a protein released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT): The patient has been on subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for DVT prophylaxis, indicating a concern for blood clot formation in the deep veins.
4. Acute renal failure: The patient's initial laboratory results showed elevated creatinine levels, which can be indicative of kidney dysfunction.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 63-year-old type I diabetic who presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) due to not taking insulin. The patient's condition was complicated by worsening nausea, chest pain (CP), EKG changes with Tw flattening, and slight troponin leak to 0.8. The patient was started on a heparin drip, and heparin was discontinued yesterday. Currently, the patient is stable and has been called out of the ICU.

The patient's medical history includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and chronic extremity ulcer. Review of systems revealed gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea. Vital signs include a temperature of 36.8°C, heart rate of 91 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 156/52 to 165/96 mmHg, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air.

Physical examination findings include well-nourished general appearance, normal cardiovascular examination, absent peripheral pulses in both lower extremities, clear breath sounds on respiratory examination, soft non-tender abdomen, warm skin, and attentive neurologic status.

Laboratory results show elevated blood glucose levels ranging from 56 to 237 mg/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.7 K/uL, anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.1 g/dL, elevated creatinine levels of 1.3 to 1.6 mg/dL, and improved troponin levels from 0.02 to 0.03. Other lab values are within normal limits.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - Resolved.
2. Hypoglycemia - Overnight hypoglycemia, reduce evening NPH by 2U.
3. Leukocytosis - No specific treatment indicated.
4. Metabolic acidosis - Resolved.
5. Acute renal failure - Resolved.
6. Altered mental status - Cleared.
7. Chronic extremity ulcer - Clean and almost healed.
8. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) - Troponins improved, outpatient stress test recommended.
9. Hypertension - Well-controlled.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) - The patient initially presented with DKA, which can lead to serious complications if not promptly treated. DKA occurs when there is a deficiency of insulin and an excess of ketones in the blood, leading to acidosis and dehydration.
2. Hypoglycemia - The patient experienced hypoglycemia overnight. Hypoglycemia can cause neurological symptoms, including confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness.
3. Leukocytosis - Elevated white blood cell count may indicate an infection or inflammation in the body.
4. Metabolic acidosis - The patient had metabolic acidosis, which can result in organ dysfunction and failure if not corrected.
5. Acute renal failure - The patient had acute renal failure, which can be life-threatening and may require dialysis.
6. Altered mental status - The patient initially had altered mental status, which could be due to various causes, including electrolyte imbalances, infection, or cerebral edema.
7. Chronic extremity ulcer - Although the patient's chronic extremity ulcer appears clean and almost healed, it can still pose a risk for infection and complications if not properly managed.
8. Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) - The patient had NSTEMI, which can lead to heart attack if not treated promptly. The patient should undergo further evaluation with an outpatient stress test to assess cardiac status.
