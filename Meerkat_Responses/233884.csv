","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with STEMI. He underwent drug-eluting stents placement in the RCA and now has evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for CABG.

Potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Cardiac complications: Given the patient's history of STEMI and left main disease, there is a risk of recurrent myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, or cardiac arrest.
2. Infection: As the patient is immunocompromised due to HIV, there is an increased risk of infections, including hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) or catheter-related bloodstream infections.
3. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE): The patient is on prophylactic heparin subq to prevent DVT, but there is still a risk of developing DVT or PE, especially due to prolonged immobilization in the ICU.
4. Medication side effects: Some medications, like metoprolol and atorvastatin, may have adverse effects that need to be monitored closely.
5. HIV-related complications: Although the patient is reportedly compliant with HAART, there is still a risk of opportunistic infections or progression of HIV-related illnesses.

It is important for the healthcare team to closely monitor the patient's cardiac status, administer appropriate antibiotic"

","Summary:
Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**], a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presented to the hospital with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) due to occlusion of the left main coronary artery and a distal branch of the right coronary artery. He underwent successful placement of three drug-eluting stents in the RCA. However, there is evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The patient is currently in the ICU, where he is being managed for his coronary artery disease (CAD).

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be required to address the left main disease.
2. The patient's HIV status and compliance with HAART should be closely monitored.
3. There is a risk of recurrent cardiac events, such as another heart attack or arrhythmias.
4. The patient may develop complications related to his stents, including restenosis or thrombosis.
5. Given the presence of risk factors for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the patient should be on prophylactic measures to prevent DVT.
6. Proper glycemic control is essential for the patient's overall management.
7. The patient's renal function needs to be monitored due to the use of certain medications.
8. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia ("

The patient was started on low-dose lisinopril based on the echo findings. They experienced wheezing and dyspnea, for which nebs and cough suppressants were prescribed. The patient also had pain at the groin site but the size of the hematoma remained unchanged. Their temperature was recorded as 99.5 degrees Celsius, which they stated was high for them. Allergies include codeine, nausea/vomiting, tetracycline, and rash/wheezing. The last dose of antibiotics given was cefazolin at 10:38 AM on 5/10/2153. The patient is currently on heparin sodium for prophylaxis since 12:00 AM on 5/11/2153. Other medications include ICU medications and other medications.

Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**], a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presented to the hospital with two episodes of chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI. He underwent stenting of the distal RCA and has evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for CABG. The patient is currently in the ICU where he experienced a hematoma in the right groin after a trans thoracic echo. His LVEF is reduced at 35% due to akinesis of the inferior free wall, hypokinesis of the inferior septum, and posterior wall. The patient is on various medications including aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and antiretrovirals. He also has a history of BPH, insomnia, and DVT prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient's immunocompromised status due to HIV increases the risk of infections. Monitoring for signs of infection, such as fever, increased white blood cell count, or new onset of symptoms, is important.
2. Bleeding: The patient developed a hematoma in the right groin after the trans thoracic echo. This could be a sign of bleeding tendency, possibly related to anticoagulant therapy. Monitoring for any signs of bleeding or oozing from the site is crucial.
3. Cardiac complications: The patient has a history of STEMI"

   Hypotension
   Some diarrhea overnight and CBC consistent with volume contraction

   or cardiogenic. No evidence of sepsis or infective cause. Describes
   some vagal symptoms also.
   - Fluids
   - Follow hematoma and CBC/other labs for contraction and expansion
   Groin Hematoma
   Non-pulsatile and without bruit, thus representing some hemorrhage into
   soft tissues. Was stable this morning and slightly worsened later in
   a.m. Hematocrit increased due to volume contraction so unable to
   evaluate bleed, but could not be large volume and palpation reveals
   smallish loss.
   - Follow groin hematoma size by marking
   - Follow hematocrit
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (150) and heparin given importance of Rx CAD,
   over reducing symptomatic, but non-serious, bleed.
   Cough
   Slightly worsened, per the patient. Upper respiratory tract infection
   was a likely inciting event for this AMI. We do not know what his CD4
   count is, so both typical and atypical infections are possible,
   modified by his continuance of Bactrim and acyclovir.

Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**], a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART, presented to the hospital with chest pain and was diagnosed with a STEMI. He underwent stenting of the RCA and has been admitted to the ICU. 

During his stay in the ICU, Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**] experienced several events. He developed a hematoma in the right groin after a trans thoracic echo, which was stable and monitored. The echo also showed reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% with focal akinesis. He was started on low-dose lisinopril based on the echo findings. He complained of wheezing and dyspnea, for which nebs and cough suppressants were prescribed. He reported pain at the groin site, but the size of the hematoma remained unchanged. His temperature increased slightly to 99.5°F, which he considered high for him. 

The patient's allergies include codeine, nausea/vomiting, tetracycline, and rash/wheezing. His last dose of antibiotics was cefazolin at [**2153-5-10**] 10:38 AM. He is currently receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and other ICU medications. 

Review of systems remains unchanged from admission except for the noted symptoms. The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature (T"

   Assessment
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**] is a 51 YOM with HIV on HAART who presented from his PCP's
   office with 2 episodes of chest pain in the last day and was found to
   have STEMI with 50% left main and total occlusion of distal branch of
   the RCA who is now s/p drug eluting stents to the RCA.
   Plan
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Now s/p DESs to distal RCA.  Has evidence of left main disease which is
   an indication for CABG.
   - Stop Integrillin
   -ASA 325 mg daily
   -clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   -f/u lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   -metoprolol 25 mg TID; consider change to succinate tomorrow
   -check echocardiogram
   -consider initiation of ACEi
   -check A1c
   -repeat ECG tomorrow
   -consider CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] c/s for elective CABG
   -smoking cessation counseling
   Hypotension
   Some diarrhea overnight and CBC consistent with volume contraction
   (concentration). Therefore likely due to hypovolemia, rather than bleed
   or cardiogenic. No evidence of sepsis or infective cause. Describes
   some vagal symptoms also.
   - Fluids
   - Follow hematoma and CBC/other labs for contraction and expansion
   Groin Hematoma
   Non-pulsatile and without bruit, thus representing some hemorrhage into
   soft tissues. Was stable this morning and slightly worsened later in
   a.m. Hematocrit increased due to volume contraction so unable to
   evaluate bleed, but could not be large volume and palpation reveals
   smallish loss.
   - Follow groin hematoma size by marking
   - Follow hematocrit
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (150) and heparin given importance of Rx CAD,
   over reducing symptomatic, but non-serious, bleed.
   Cough
   Slightly worsened, per the patient. Upper respiratory tract infection
   was a likely inciting event for this AMI. We do not know what his CD4
   count is, so both typical and atypical infections are possible,
   modified by his continuance of Bactrim and acyclovir.
   - Chest x-ray
   - Send sputum for culture and Gram stain
   - Consider AFBs if worsens
   HIV
   No recent CD4 counts in our records, but reportedly compliant with
   HAART.
   - continue Kaletra 50 mg  2 Tabs [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue Trizivir 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophy
   - continue acyclovir
   BPH
   - continue terazosin
   Insomnia
   - holding trazodone for now given arrhythmogenicity
   -DVT ppx with Heparin subq
   - bowel regimen - docusate
   - pain - tylenol PRN

","Summary of Progress Note:
- The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with STEMI.
- He underwent drug-eluting stents to the RCA due to total occlusion and has evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for CABG.
- The patient is currently experiencing hypotension, possibly due to volume contraction, and a non-pulsatile groin hematoma without bruit.
- His cough has slightly worsened, and a chest x-ray revealed a retrocardiac opacity, although it is somewhat ambiguous.
- The patient is on various medications including ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and heparin.
- He has a history of allergies to codeine, nausea/vomiting, tetracycline, rash, and wheezing.
- The patient's review of systems is unchanged from admission except for the mentioned symptoms.
- The patient's vital signs are as follows: temperature 37.6°C (99.6°F), heart rate 92 bpm (range 73-95), blood pressure 103/62 mmHg (range 71-137/86), respiratory rate 14 breaths per minute (range 10-22), oxygen saturation 96%, and heart rhythm is sinus tachycardia.
- The patient's weight is 65 kg, with a balance of -80 mL and a total intake/output of 1620 mL (520 mL PO, 1100 mL IVF, and 700 mL blood products).
- Physical examination reveals a well-dressed and oriented patient with no pallor or cyanosis, supple neck, no jugular venous distention, and a PMI located in the 5th intercostal space.
- There are no chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or kyphosis, and the patient's extremities show no edema or femoral bruits.
- The patient's lab results show an elevated troponin T level of 9.75 (above the reference range), slightly low hemoglobin of 46.0 g/dL, and normal platelet count of 176 K/uL.
- Imaging reveals a retrocardiac opacity on chest x-ray, and the ECG is not provided.
- The patient's plan includes stopping Integrillin, initiating ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and considering a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently low, indicating the possibility of ongoing hypotension. This may require further evaluation and management.
2. Groin Hematoma: The patient has a non-pulsatile groin hematoma without bruit, which may represent hemorrhage into the soft tissues. Monitoring the hematoma size and hematocrit levels is crucial.
3. Cough: The patient's cough has slightly worsened, and a chest x-ray revealed a retrocardiac opacity. Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate management.
4. Coronary Artery Disease: The patient has evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for CABG. Potential complications related to the procedure should be considered.
5. HIV: The patient's HIV status should be closely monitored, and adherence to HAART therapy should be assessed."

   Assessment
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**] is a 51 YOM with HIV on HAART who presented from his PCP's
   office with 2 episodes of chest pain in the last day and was found to
   have STEMI with 50% left main and total occlusion of distal branch of
   the RCA who is now s/p drug eluting stents to the RCA.
   Plan
   Cough, shortness of breath
   Based on physical exam is likely COPD flare, without focality
   suggestive of pneumonia. Therefore will await CD4 count to decide on
   atypical treatment and otherwise proceed with COPD Rx. Given present
   tachycardia, will hold albuterol for now. Given upper respiratory tract
   infection for last two weeks, shadow on CXR and low-grade fever, is
   likely [**2-27**] infection/PNA.

   - Mucomyst nebs
   - Continue Tessalon
   - Nasal canula
   - Prednisone 50 mg PO QD
   - Ceftriaxone 1g
   - Fluid resuscitation
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Now s/p DESs to distal RCA.  Has evidence of left main disease which is
   an indication for CABG.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   -clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   -f/u lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   -metoprolol 25 mg TID; consider change to succinate
   -Check echocardiogram
   -Start lisinopril 5 mg QD
   -Repeat ECG
   -Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] c/s for elective CABG as outpatient
   -Continue smoking cessation counseling
   Hypotension
   Some diarrhea overnight and CBC consistent with volume contraction
   (concentration). Therefore likely due to hypovolemia, rather than bleed
   or cardiogenic. No evidence of sepsis or infective cause. Describes
   some vagal symptoms also.
   - Fluids
   - Follow hematoma and CBC/other labs for contraction and expansion
   Groin Hematoma
   Non-pulsatile and without bruit, thus representing some hemorrhage into
   soft tissues. Was stable this morning and slightly worsened later in
   a.m. Hematocrit increased due to volume contraction so unable to
   evaluate bleed, but could not be large volume and palpation reveals
   smallish loss.
   - Follow groin hematoma size by marking
   - Follow hematocrit
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (150) and heparin given importance of Rx CAD,
   over reducing symptomatic, but non-serious, bleed.
   Cough
   Slightly worsened, per the patient. Upper respiratory tract infection
   was a likely inciting event for this AMI. We do not know what his CD4
   count is, so both typical and atypical infections are possible,
   modified by his continuance of Bactrim and acyclovir.
   - Chest x-ray
   - Send sputum for culture and Gram stain
   - Consider AFBs if worsens

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with a history of HIV on HAART who presented with two episodes of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. The patient underwent drug-eluting stents to the RCA. 

The patient's current conditions include cough, shortness of breath, hypotension, groin hematoma, and coronary artery disease. 

The potential medical complications that can arise include:
1. Pneumonia: The patient's symptoms of cough, low-grade fever, and a shadow on the chest X-ray suggest a possible infection, which could progress to pneumonia if not treated appropriately.
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): Although there is no direct evidence of diabetes in the provided information, DKA can occur in individuals with uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
3. Hypotension: The patient's blood pressure is consistently in the high 90s systolic, indicating a potential for ongoing hypotension.
4. Coronary artery disease (CAD): The patient has evidence of left main disease, indicating a need for CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting). This suggests a potential risk of recurrent myocardial infarction or unstable angina.
5. Groin hematoma: The patient has a non-pulsatile groin hematoma that has slightly worsened. This may indicate ongoing bleeding or a risk of infection.

It is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, administer appropriate treatments for the"

   Cardiology Teaching Physician Note
   On this day I saw, examined and was physically present with the
   resident / fellow for the key portions of the services provided. I
   agree with the above note and plans.
   I would add the following remarks:
   History
   Day 3 post inferoposterior MI.  Echo has shown EF 30-35%. New complaint
   of dyspnea, cough and wheezing.
   Physical Examination
   JVP approximately 10-12 cm.
   Lungs with decreased air movement and bilateral wheezing.
   Heart: Distant sounds, PMI displaced inferior; No murmur or gallop
   Extremities: No edema
   Medical Decision Making
   Cardiac status stable post MI.  New dyspnea most likely secondary to
   COPD exacerbation with possible acute infection.  Will follow-up CXR
   today, add antibiotic coverage, steroids pending CD40 count,
   bronchodilators.  ID consult if not improving.
   Have considered heart failure cause with possibility of post MI mitral
   regurgitation but no murmur or other clinical evidence.  Will repeat
   echo if not improving.

","Summary:
The patient is a 63-year-old male with a chief complaint of chest pain and a diagnosis of STEMI. The patient has been experiencing dyspnea and was given IV steroids, standing nebs, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin for suspected community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). However, there may be consideration for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAp) if no clinical improvement is seen. The patient developed abdominal hematomas from subQ heparin and was taken off prophylactic hep, with pneumoboots placed instead. 

The patient's allergies include codeine, nausea/vomiting, tetracycline, rash, and wheezing. The last doses of antibiotics given were cefazolin on 05/10/20XX at 10:38 AM and ceftriaxone on 05/12/20XX at 09:00 AM.

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 36.9°C (98.5°F), heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 120/73 mmHg to 92/52 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on a nasal cannula. The patient is in sinus rhythm.

Fluid balance shows a total input of 3,396 mL with an output of 2,800 mL, resulting in a balance of 596 mL. The patient is"

 PAIN CONTROL (ACUTE PAIN, CHRONIC PAIN)
 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Assessment
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**] is a 51 YOM with HIV on HAART who presented from his PCP's
   office with 2 episodes of chest pain in the last day and was found to
   have STEMI with 50% left main and total occlusion of distal branch of
   the RCA who is now s/p drug eluting stents to the RCA.
   Plan
   Cough, shortness of breath
   Based on physical exam is likely COPD flare, however new focality
   suggestive of pneumonia. Therefore will await CD4 count to decide on
   atypical treatment and otherwise proceed with COPD Rx. Given present
   tachycardia, will hold albuterol for now. Given upper respiratory tract
   infection for last two weeks, shadow on CXR and low-grade fever, is
   likely [**2-27**] infection/PNA.
   - Ipratropium nebs
   - Mucomyst nebs
   - Continue Tessalon
   - Nasal canula
   - Prednisone 50 mg PO QD
   - Ceftriaxone 1g
   - Azithromycin
   - Fluid resuscitation
   Coronary Artery Disease
   Now s/p DESs to distal RCA.  Has evidence of left main disease which is
   an indication for CABG.
   - ASA 325 mg daily
   -clopidogrel 75 mg daily
   -f/u lipid profile; atorvastatin 80 mg daily
   -metoprolol 25 mg TID; consider change to succinate
   -Check echocardiogram
   -Start lisinopril 5 mg QD
   -Repeat ECG
   -Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] c/s for elective CABG as outpatient
   -Continue smoking cessation counseling
   Hypotension
   Some diarrhea overnight and CBC consistent with volume contraction
   (concentration). Therefore likely due to hypovolemia, rather than bleed
   or cardiogenic. No evidence of sepsis or infective cause. Describes
   some vagal symptoms also.
   - Fluids
   - Follow hematoma and CBC/other labs for contraction and expansion
   Groin Hematoma
   Non-pulsatile and without bruit, thus representing some hemorrhage into
   soft tissues. Was stable this morning and slightly worsened later in
   a.m. Hematocrit increased due to volume contraction so unable to
   evaluate bleed, but could not be large volume and palpation reveals
   smallish loss.
   - Follow groin hematoma size by marking
   - Follow hematocrit
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (150) and heparin given importance of Rx CAD,
   over reducing symptomatic, but non-serious, bleed.
   Cough
   Slightly worsened, per the patient. Upper respiratory tract infection
   was a likely inciting event for this AMI. We do not know what his CD4
   count is, so both typical and atypical infections are possible,
   modified by his continuance of Bactrim and acyclovir.
   - Chest x-ray
   - Send sputum for culture and Gram stain
   - Consider AFBs if worsens
   HIV
   No recent CD4 counts in our records, but reportedly compliant with
   HAART.
   - continue Kaletra 50 mg  2 Tabs [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue Trizivir 1 tab [**Hospital1 **]
   - continue bactrim prophy
   - continue acyclovir
   BPH
   - continue terazosin
   Insomnia
   - holding trazodone for now given arrhythmogenicity

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART who presented with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI with occlusion of the RCA. The patient underwent drug-eluting stents to the RCA. 

The patient is currently experiencing shortness of breath and cough, which is likely due to a COPD flare-up or pneumonia. There is also a concern for possible pneumonia given the upper respiratory tract infection, low-grade fever, and shadow on the chest X-ray.

The patient has a history of coronary artery disease and now requires coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) due to evidence of left main disease. The plan includes ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and smoking cessation counseling.

The patient also has hypotension, which may be due to volume contraction. The groin hematoma is stable and non-pulsatile without bruit, suggesting hemorrhage into the soft tissues. 

The patient's HIV status is being managed with HAART therapy, and there is a need for further evaluation of the CD4 count to guide treatment decisions. 

Potential medical complications that can arise include worsening of COPD flare-up or pneumonia, cardiac complications related to coronary artery disease, and potential infections due to immunocompromised state. Close monitoring and appropriate management are necessary to address these potential complications."

 CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD, ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE)
   Assessment
   Mr. [**Known lastname 12636**] is a 51 YOM with HIV on HAART who presented from his PCP's
   office with 2 episodes of chest pain in the last day and was found to
   have STEMI with 50% left main and total occlusion of distal branch of
   the RCA who is now s/p drug eluting stents to the RCA.
   Plan
   Cough, shortness of breath
   Based on physical exam is likely COPD flare, however new focality
   suggestive of pneumonia. Therefore will await CD4 count to decide on
   atypical treatment and otherwise proceed with COPD Rx. Given present
   tachycardia, will hold albuterol for now. Given upper respiratory tract
   infection for last two weeks, shadow on CXR and low-grade fever, is
   likely [**2-27**] infection/PNA.

   Coronary Artery Disease
   Now s/p DESs to distal RCA.  Has evidence of left main disease which is
   an indication for CABG.

   -Start lisinopril 5 mg QD
   -Repeat ECG
   -Consider CT [**Doctor First Name 91**] c/s for elective CABG as outpatient
   -Continue smoking cessation counseling
   Hypotension
   Some diarrhea overnight and CBC consistent with volume contraction
   (concentration). Therefore likely due to hypovolemia, rather than bleed
   or cardiogenic. No evidence of sepsis or infective cause. Describes
   some vagal symptoms also.
   - Fluids
   - Follow hematoma and CBC/other labs for contraction and expansion
   Groin Hematoma
   Non-pulsatile and without bruit, thus representing some hemorrhage into
   soft tissues. Was stable this morning and slightly worsened later in
   a.m. Hematocrit increased due to volume contraction so unable to
   evaluate bleed, but could not be large volume and palpation reveals
   smallish loss.
   - Follow groin hematoma size by marking
   - Follow hematocrit
   - Continue ASA, Plavix (150) and heparin given importance of Rx CAD,
   over reducing symptomatic, but non-serious, bleed.
   Cough
   Slightly worsened, per the patient. Upper respiratory tract infection
   was a likely inciting event for this AMI. We do not know what his CD4
   count is, so both typical and atypical infections are possible,
   modified by his continuance of Bactrim and acyclovir.
   - Chest x-ray
   - Send sputum for culture and Gram stain

","Summary:
The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART who presented with chest pain and was found to have a STEMI. He underwent stenting of the RCA and has a history of coronary artery disease. The patient also has symptoms suggestive of pneumonia, possibly related to an upper respiratory tract infection. He has developed abdominal hematomas from subQ heparin and is being monitored closely. His current medications include aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, lisinopril, and continuing HAART therapy. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 80 bpm, blood pressure of 120/73 mmHg, respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on nasal cannula. The patient's blood cultures are pending, and imaging shows persistent patchy left retrocardiac opacity that could reflect atelectasis or focal pneumonia. The patient's pain is controlled, and he is receiving appropriate treatment for COPD flare and suspected pneumonia. The plan includes continued therapy for coronary artery disease, monitoring of the groin hematoma, and evaluation for potential CABG surgery in the future."

","Based on the provided medical progress note, here is a summary of the patient's health progress in the ICU:

The patient is a 51-year-old male with HIV on HAART who presented with two episodes of chest pain and was found to have a STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction). He underwent drug-eluting stents to the RCA (right coronary artery) due to 50% occlusion. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease (CAD), for which he is prescribed medications such as ASA, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, and lisinopril.

The patient is currently being treated for pneumonia, as evidenced by symptoms like cough and shortness of breath, as well as findings on the chest X-ray. He is receiving ipratropium nebs, Mucomyst nebs, Tessalon pearls, prednisone, ceftriaxone, and azithromycin.

The patient also has a groin hematoma, which was stable initially but worsened later in the morning. His hematocrit increased due to volume contraction, making it difficult to evaluate the extent of bleeding. The plan includes monitoring the hematoma size, hematocrit levels, and performing an ultrasound to rule out any leaking hematoma. The patient is also on ASA and Plavix (150) for antiplatelet therapy.

Regarding his HIV status, the patient is reportedly compliant with HAART therapy, but"
