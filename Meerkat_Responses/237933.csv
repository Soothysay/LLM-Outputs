   Disposition:
","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was transferred to the MICU from another hospital for management of acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's current condition includes altered mental status, hypoxia, acute right foot ischemia, acute on chronic renal failure, decompensated systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure, recent myocardial infarction with stent placement, lower extremity ulcers, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypercholesterolemia/hypertension/peripheral vascular disease, gout, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).

Potential medical complications that can arise based on the patient's conditions include:
1. Worsening renal failure leading to further electrolyte imbalances and fluid overload.
2. Progressive congestive heart failure exacerbation, resulting in pulmonary edema and respiratory distress.
3. Development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to immobilization and underlying hypercoagulable state.
4. Complications related to diabetes such as hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
5. Cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction"

The patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was transferred to the MICU from another hospital for the management of acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Altered mental status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to worsening uremia, as it is temporally related. Other considerations include PRES, encephalitis, and TTT/HUS, although they are less likely.
2. Hypoxia: The patient's hypoxia is likely due to volume overload from renal failure. She has been unresponsive to lasix, and her condition may improve after hemodialysis (HD).
3. Acute right foot ischemia: The patient has stable but cool extremities with minimal pulses. Further evaluation is needed, and vascular consultation is required.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The etiology of the patient's acute renal failure is unclear. Urine electrolytes suggest a pre-renal etiology, but BUN/creatinine and potassium levels indicate worsening renal function. A renal biopsy may be necessary at some point.

","Summary of the progress note:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and renal transplant. She was admitted to the ICU due to worsening mental status, which was initially thought to be secondary to uremic encephalopathy. The patient underwent an angiogram for concern of left lower extremity ischemia but experienced increased somnolence during the procedure and was unable to complete it. The patient is currently on multiple medications including NAC, lactulose, Core, Colace, tacrolimus, protonix, Cellcept, synthroid, hydralazine, iron, ASA, Plavix, and prednisone.

Potential medical complications:
1. Neurological complications: The patient has persistent altered mental status, which can be attributed to uremia. Other considerations include occult infection, PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome) in the setting of tacrolimus, and tacrolimus toxicity (with normal level). Further evaluation is needed, including blood cultures, urinalysis, urine cultures, and possibly an MRI or EEG if the patient does not improve after initiation of hemodialysis.
2. Ischemic right foot: The patient had an attempted angiogram for ischemic right foot, but it was aborted due to her mental status. She is currently on a heparin drip. If there are any signs of worsening ischemia, the patient may need further evaluation by vascular medicine. Considering her"

","Based on the provided information, the patient has multiple medical complications. Here are the potential medical complications that can arise:

1. Altered mental status: The patient is experiencing an altered mental state, which is likely related to worsening uremia (kidney failure). Other possible causes include PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), encephalitis, TTT/HUS (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome), although they are less likely.

2. Hypoxia: The patient has unexplained hypoxia despite being on therapeutic coumadin and heparin. This may be due to volume overload from renal failure or pulmonary hypertension.

3. Acute right foot ischemia: The patient has minimal pulses in the left lower extremity, suggesting critical limb ischemia. Immediate re-evaluation after hemodialysis is recommended.

4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's BUN/Creatinine and potassium levels indicate worsening renal function. Further evaluation, such as a renal biopsy, is necessary to determine the etiology.

5. Decompensated systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure: The patient's BNP level of 12,000+ suggests severe heart failure. Holding on Lasix and considering hemodialysis in the morning are part of the management plan.

6. Recent myocardial infarction with stent placement: The patient has a history of recent myocardial infar"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yoF with h/o renal transplant; admitted with worsening renal failure
   and transferred to ICU for worsening encephalopathy.
   1.       Hypoxemia:  Transient worsening hypoxemia overnight in setting
   of being supine and rolling.  CXR indicative of only mild volume
   overload.  Other possibilities include an aspiration event (slight
   crackles at the right base), unlikely to be pulmonary embolism in
   setting of therapeutic INR and transient worsening of hypxoxemia.
   -Dialysis today
   - Will consider chest CT if unimproved
   2.       Encephalopathy:  currently unclear etiology; possible
   component of uremic encephalopathy.  Now with new fevers and persistent
   AMS.
   - LP
   - MRI (w/o gadolinium)
   - d/c narcotics; trial of narcan
   3.       Infection:
   - Initiate antibiotics while awaiting LP:
   vancomycin/ceftriaxone/ampicillin/acyclovir
   - Check differential
   - f/u cultures
   - EBV/CMV/BK virus
   - Send fungal studies: B-glucan/galactomannan
   4.  Vascular:  cool right lower extremity
   - hold heparin for possible LP
   - Send hypercoaguability evaluation

   Disposition : Remains in ICU, critically ill
   Total time spent:  35minutes
","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant admitted to the ICU for worsening renal failure and encephalopathy. She underwent dialysis for ultrafiltration yesterday and experienced desaturation while rolling overnight, requiring nasal oxygen. She also had a fever overnight, and cultures were obtained. The patient has allergies to codeine, nausea/vomiting, phenegran (promethazine HCl), Tylenol (oral) (DM HB/Pseudoephed/Acetamin/Cp), quinolones, oxycodone, enalapril, and unknown medications. She is currently on various infusions and medications including lactulose, core, colace, simvastatin, synthroid, hydralazine, Fe, insulin sliding scale, ASA, plavix, cellcept, and tacrolimus.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.1 C (100.6 F), heart rate of 67 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 128/27 to 156/50 mmHg, respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 98% on 4 liters of nasal cannula. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus rhythm. Fluid balance shows an intake of 372 mL and output of 139 mL, resulting in a negative balance of 1,128 mL. The patient's ABG results indicate a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 32, PaO2 of 58, and HCO3- of 20 mEq/L. Her lung function is compromised, as evidenced by crackles at the right base on chest examination.

Laboratory results reveal a hemoglobin level of 7.8 g/dL, leukocyte count of 10.9 K/uL, platelet count of 186 K/uL, creatinine level of 3.6 mg/dL, troponin-T level of 0.06, total CO2 of 21, glucose level of 122 mg/dL, and elevated levels of PT/PTT/INR. Other lab values show elevated lactic acid, LDH, and liver enzymes. Blood cultures are pending, and urinalysis indicates trace leukocytes and bacteria. Chest X-ray shows elevated right hemidiaphragm and perihilar fullness, without focal consolidation.

Assessment and plan:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced transient worsening hypoxemia overnight, which could be due to being supine and rolling. The CXR indicates only mild volume overload, making pulmonary embolism unlikely. Other possibilities include aspiration, but this is not confirmed. The patient will undergo dialysis today, and a chest CT may be considered if there is no improvement.
2. Encephalopathy: The patient has worsening encephalopathy of unclear etiology, possibly related to uremic encephalopathy. New fevers"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant who was admitted with worsening renal failure and transferred to the ICU for worsening encephalopathy. She has had several medical issues overnight, including hypoxemia while rolling, febrile with cultures obtained, and a cool right lower extremity. The patient is currently on multiple medications and has various lab abnormalities.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient experienced transient worsening hypoxemia overnight, which could be due to factors such as being supine and rolling, aspiration event, or pulmonary embolism. Further investigation, including a chest CT, may be necessary if the patient's condition does not improve.
2. Encephalopathy: The cause of the patient's encephalopathy is unclear, with possible components of uremic encephalopathy. Additional tests, such as a lumbar puncture (LP) and MRI (without gadolinium), may be needed to determine the underlying cause. The patient's narcotics should be discontinued, and narcan should be considered.
3. Infection: The patient has developed fevers, and infection is a concern. Empirical antibiotics have been initiated while awaiting the results of the LP. It is important to check the differential, follow up with cultures, and also test for EBV/CMV/BK virus and fungal studies.
4. Vascular issue: The patient has a cool right lower extremity, which may indicate a"

   Disposition:
","Based on the provided information, the patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities including chronic kidney disease post-deceased donor renal transplant, coronary artery disease post-myocardial infarction/stents, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was transferred to the hospital for management of acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient's current condition includes:
1. Respiratory failure: The patient is on supplemental oxygen and has an ABG indicating respiratory acidosis. The CXR shows pulmonary engorgement consistent with elevated pulmonary venous pressure, but no other significant findings.
2. Altered mental status: The patient is unresponsive and has a history of worsening uremia. Other possible causes like PRES, encephalitis, TTT/HUS are less likely. Further investigations such as EEG, CSF analysis, and imaging are pending.
3. Acute right foot ischemia: The patient has minimal pulses in her left lower extremity and coolness in the right foot. Vascular consultation is planned post hemodialysis.
4. Acute on chronic renal failure: The patient's BUN/Creatinine ratio and potassium levels suggest worsening renal function. Renal ultrasound with dopplers was normal, and a renal biopsy may be necessary at some point.
5. Decompensated systolic/diastolic congestive heart failure:"

","Based on the provided information, there are several potential medical complications that can arise in this patient's case:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing acute respiratory failure, which may be caused by factors such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's hypoxia and decreased respiratory rate indicate a need for close monitoring and intervention.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient is presenting with an altered mental status, which could be due to various causes including uremia (kidney failure), encephalitis, or other metabolic disturbances. Further investigation, such as an EEG, is needed to determine the underlying cause.

3. Diabetic Complications: The patient has a history of type II diabetes mellitus, which increases the risk of complications like diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemia, or hypoglycemia. Close monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential.

4. Decubitus Ulcer: The patient has a pre-existing decubitus ulcer, which may worsen due to immobility and pressure on certain areas. Proper skin care and regular repositioning are necessary to prevent further complications.

5. Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD): The patient has a history of PVD with critical limb ischemia, putting them at risk for tissue necrosis or amputation if blood flow is not adequately restored. Vascular consultation and re-evaluation are recommended.

6. Renal Failure: The patient is experiencing acute renal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, currently admitted to the ICU with encephalopathy and renal failure. She has been febrile, required increased oxygen, and experienced crackles at the right base with bronchial breath sounds on physical examination. The patient is on multiple medications including antibiotics, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and other medications for various conditions. Her vital signs show a fever, high blood pressure, and increased respiratory rate. She is also receiving heparin drip for suspected R LE ischemia. The patient's lab results indicate elevated WBC, Cr, and TropT levels, as well as decreased Hct and Plt levels. The CXR reveals engorgement of vessels, pulmonary edema, and increased opacity in the right lower lobe.

Potential medical complications that can arise:
1. Infection: The patient's symptoms of fever, increased WBC count, and crackles in the lungs suggest a possible infection, which may require broad-spectrum antibiotics. The CXR findings are more concerning for a developing pneumonia, potentially due to aspiration.
2. Renal failure: The patient's history of renal transplant and acute on chronic renal failure indicate compromised renal function. The elevated creatinine level further supports this.
3. Neurological complications: Encephalopathy is present, and the patient is somnolent but responsive to voice. Further evaluation with EEG and f/u MRI read"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, currently experiencing encephalopathy and renal failure. She has been febrile, required increased oxygen, and showed crackles at the right base with bronchial breath sounds on physical examination. Her labs indicate elevated creatinine and potassium levels, as well as leukocytosis. Chest X-ray revealed engorgement of vessels, pulmonary edema, and increased opacity in the right lower lobe. She is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected septicemia and possible hospital-acquired pneumonia (HCAP). Other conditions being managed include neurologic encephalopathy, right lower extremity ischemia, cardiovascular disease, and hypoxemia.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Sepsis/Infectious Disease: The patient's fevers, leukocytosis, and chest X-ray findings suggest an infectious etiology. If not appropriately managed, there is a risk of progression to sepsis or septic shock.
2. Pneumonia: Given the pulmonary edema and increased opacity in the right lower lobe on the chest X-ray, the patient may have developed pneumonia. If not treated effectively, this could lead to worsening respiratory status.
3. Neurologic Complications: The patient's encephalopathy needs further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. If left untreated, it could result in neurological decline.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease post deceased donor renal transplant, coronary artery disease post myocardial infarction/stents, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted for acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure. She is currently in the ICU with several ongoing medical issues.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: Possible right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient has not improved with hemodialysis fluid removal. A CT chest without contrast, TTE with bubble study, and sputum culture should be considered.
2. Altered mental status: Likely related to worsening uremia as it is temporally related. No signs of infection. No focal neurologic signs but has been supratherapeutic in heparin. Other considerations include PRES, encephalitis, TTT/HUS although all less likely.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure.

The patient has been on various treatments and medications, including antibiotics (vancomycin and cefepime), antivirals (acyclovir), heparin sodium infusion, lansoprazole, and others. She also received hemodialysis sessions.

Potential Medical Complications:

1. Respiratory Failure: The patient is experiencing respiratory failure, which may be due to possible right lower lobe pneumonia. This has not improved with hemodialysis and fluid removal. Further interventions, such as a TTE with bubble study, CT torso without IV contrast, and sputum culture, may be necessary.

2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status is likely related to worsening uremia. Other considerations include PRES, encephalitis, TTT/HUS, but these are less likely. EEG findings were non-specific, and further monitoring and evaluation are needed.

3. Acute Right Foot Ischemia: The patient has minimal pulses in her left lower extremity and is cool to touch. A vascular re-evaluation post hemodialysis is planned.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant who was admitted with renal failure. She is now experiencing altered mental status (AMS) and bacteremia. The patient has undergone several interventions, including blood cultures, hemodialysis (HD), and antibiotic administration. She is currently on multiple medications for various conditions. The patient's vital signs indicate a fever, elevated heart rate, and low blood pressure. Her respiratory support includes oxygen delivery through an aerosol-cool device, with a SpO2 of 94%. The physical examination reveals clear lungs, regular heart rhythm, and minimal edema. Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, creatinine levels, and liver enzymes. Blood cultures have been positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCs). The assessment and plan include addressing hypoxemia, infection, and neurologic status. The patient is being treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and is undergoing further evaluation for potential sources of infection. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's low oxygen saturation levels may indicate respiratory distress or impaired gas exchange. This could be due to pneumonia (PNA), aspiration, or volume overload. Monitoring and adjusting FiO2 levels, along with addressing any underlying causes, will be important in managing this condition.

2. Infection (ID): The patient's fevers and elevated white blood cell count suggest bacteremia. The presence of GPCs in clusters indicates a possible infection caused by St"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, admitted with renal failure and now presenting with altered mental status and bacteremia. She has been treated with multiple antibiotics and is currently on cefipime and vancomycin. The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 38.4°C, blood pressure ranging from 126/46 to 145/83 mmHg, heart rate between 63-83 bpm, respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 94%. Her laboratory results indicate anemia with a hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.0 K/uL, thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 142 K/uL, and elevated creatinine levels. The patient's EEG shows triphasic waves, suggesting an unclear etiology for her altered mental status.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxemia: The patient's respiratory rate is elevated, and her oxygen saturation is below normal, indicating a possible respiratory infection or aspiration event. The physician plans to downtitrate her FiO2 if possible and perform a chest CT to further evaluate the situation.

2. Infectious Disease (ID): The patient has fevers and leukocytosis, suggesting a potential bacterial infection. Although her initial chest X-ray was clear, subsequent development of bacteremia with GPCs in clusters"

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acute worsening of renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, decubitus ulcer, peripheral vascular disease with critical limb ischemia, and acute renal failure. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient has a possible right lower lobe pneumonia, which may not have improved with hemodialysis and fluid removal. Further evaluation is needed.
2. Altered mental status: This is likely related to worsening uremia, as it is temporally related. Other considerations include PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome), encephalitis, TTP/HUS (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome), although these are less likely. EEG monitoring has been started.
3. Anemia and thrombocytopenia: Both conditions are down-trending recently. Occasional schistocytes on smear suggest TTP/HUS, but further evaluation is needed.
4. Acute right foot ischemia: The patient has minimal pulses in the left lower extremity, indicating potential ischemia. V"

   - CT torso shows RLL pneumonia
   - Vanc/cefepime for possible PNA x8 days
   - sputum culture if productive sputum
   - hypercoag w/u with APLAb negative
   # Altered mental status: Likely related to worsening uremia as it is
   temporally related. No signs of infection. No focal neurologic signs
   but has been supratherapeutic in heparin. Not hypercarbic.  Other
   considerations are PRES, encephalitis, TTT/HUS although all less
   likely.  CT Head negative for any acute process.  LFTs not elevated. LP
   and MRI unrevealing. TSH normal enough. Flu negative
   - EEG with non-specific findings.  Consulted neuro and started 24 hour

","Summary of Progress Note:
The patient is a 66-year-old woman with multiple comorbidities, including chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, insulin-dependent diabetes, and diastolic congestive heart failure. She was admitted to the ICU for acutely worsening renal failure and decompensated diastolic congestive heart failure. The patient has been diagnosed with respiratory failure, altered mental status, diabetes mellitus type II, decubitus ulcer, peripheral vascular disease, renal failure, and coronary artery disease.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Hypoxia: The patient may develop worsening respiratory failure due to possible right lower lobe pneumonia.
2. Altered Mental Status: The patient's altered mental status could be related to worsening uremia, and other considerations include PRES, encephalitis, TTP/HUS, and HSV encephalitis.
3. Anemia/Thrombocytopenia: The patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia may be due to nosebleeds or could indicate TTP/HUS.
4. Acute Right Foot Ischemia: The patient has minimal pulses in the left lower extremity and may develop acute right foot ischemia.
5. Acute on Chronic Renal Failure: The patient's renal function is worsening, and the etiology is unclear. A renal biopsy may be necessary.

","Summary:
The patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant, admitted with renal failure and altered mental status. She has developed hypoxemia, fevers, and chest CT with right lower lobe pneumonia. The patient required an insulin drip for hyperglycemia and is currently on multiple medications including Plavix, Synthroid, ASA, Prednisone, Cellcept, Hydralazine, Tacrolimus, Colace, Vitamin, and Epogen.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infectious Disease: The patient has evidence of pneumonia (right lower lobe consolidation and small pleural effusion) on chest CT. She is febrile and has an elevated white blood cell count. It is important to continue vancomycin/cefipime for pneumonia and await HSV PCR results.
2. Neurological: The patient presents with persistent encephalopathy. An EEG will be performed to evaluate for non-convulsive status. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is negative, and viral studies are pending.
3. Anemia: The patient's hemoglobin concentration is decreasing, and there is a possibility of hemolysis. It is recommended to check hemolysis labs, smear for schistocytes, perform a guaiac stool test, groin ultrasound for hematoma, and consider blood transfusion if necessary.
4. Renal: The patient has worsening renal failure. Monitoring of fluid balance, electrolytes, and kidney"

   Assessment and Plan
   66yoF s/p renal transplant, admitted with worsening renal failure and
   altered mental status.
   1.  ID:  Evidence of PNA, though not clear this was the primary source
   as it is possible she aspirated during her MRI.  WBC improving, remains
   intermittently febrile.
   - Continue vancomycin/cefipime for PNA
   - Continue acyclovir awaiting HSV PCR
   2.  Neuro:  Persistent encephalopathy.
   - Getting EEG today to evaluate for non-convulsive status
   - LP negative; await viral studies.
   - Neuro service following.
   3.  Anemia:  HCT decreasing; abd CT without evidence of RP bleed
   yesterday.  Does have R groin hematoma.
   - check hemolysis labs, smear for schistocytes
   - guaiac stool
   - Groin ultrasound for hematoma
   - Transfuse

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 66-year-old female with a history of renal transplant admitted with renal failure and altered mental status. She developed hypoxemia, fevers, and chest CT with right lower lobe pneumonia (RLL PNA). The patient required an insulin drip for hyperglycemia and is currently on multiple medications including Plavix, Synthroid, ASA, Prednisone, Cellcept, Hydralazine, Tacrolimus, Colace, Vitamin, and Epogen.

The patient's vital signs show a temperature of 37.2°C (98.9°F), heart rate of 65 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 110/37-129/57 mmHg, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99%. She is on a 35% oxygen delivery device.

Physical examination reveals rhonchi on the right side of the chest, regular heart rhythm, and no significant findings in the abdomen or extremities. Laboratory results indicate elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and elevated creatinine level. Other lab values such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and liver enzymes are within normal limits.

The patient's chest CT shows RLL PNA with consolidation and a small pleural effusion. Microbiology tests indicate one bottle of cerebrospinal fluid (CNS) culture taken on October 30th, which is pending"
