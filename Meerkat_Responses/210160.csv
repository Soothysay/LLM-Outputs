   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 TID PO (on carvedilol as an outpatient)
   - Continue aspirin 325mg
   # PUMP:  Most recent echo at OSH showed an EF that was unchanged from
   prior (~30%).  No known etiology for depressed EF.  Lungs appear clear
   on CXR.
   - Restarted losartan at home dose
   - Lasix 20mg QD to continue volume loss prior to extubation
   - Metoprolol, as above
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on metoprolol.
   - Continue with metoprolol
   - Will need eval for ICD pending neurologic assessment
   # Pulmonary.  Pt. intubated on AC, overbreathing the vent 3/16 times.
   ABG nearly wnl, some Aa gradient remains.   Also some concern re:
   Aspiration PNA vs. Pneumonitis.  RSBI 96.
   -          Continue Zosyn x 3 more days.
   -          Continue diuresis
   -          Frequent suctioning.
   -          Attempt extubation later today
   # NEURO:  Improved significantly since arrival (see above for exam
   findings).  Will consider Neurology consult with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 285**]
   to further evaluate anoxic brain injury.
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.
   - Guaiac stools
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Improved to Na 141 w/ free water.  Continue OG
   feedigs.  .
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Persistent, likely peri-code, but will work-up any
   fevers with culutures, UA.  Pt. afebrile so far.  CXR with possible LLL
   infiltrate, likely aspiration pneumonitis.
   -          If has PNA, most likely aspiration; given intibation and
   continued Aa gradient, will continue pip/tazo for now (see above).
   FEN: 1.5L fluid restriction.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Since admission, she has shown significant improvement in her neurological status and is now more responsive. She required frequent suctioning of secretions from her trachea and was noted to be climbing to the side of the bed. She had 13 spontaneous breaths per minute while on ventilator support. 

Vital signs are stable with a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure of 134/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100% on FiO2 of 50%. She is receiving heparin sodium for prophylaxis and piperacillin/tazobactam (Zosyn) for suspected aspiration pneumonia or pneumonitis. 

Her lab results show a white blood cell count of 13.0 K/uL, hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL, blood glucose of 137 mg/dL, and potassium of 4.1 mEq/L. Her ABG results indicate a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 322. 

The patient has no known drug allergies and has received piperacillin/t"

   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.
   - Transition from IV metoprolol to PO (on carvedilol as an outpatient)
   - Treat with aspirin 325mg daily while unsure if this event was
   ischemic in nature
   # PUMP:  Most recent echo at OSH showed an EF that was unchanged from
   prior (~30%).  No known etiology for depressed EF.  Lungs appear clear
   on CXR.
   - Restart losartan at home dose
   - Lasix PRN; will need to ensure she is dry before extubation
   - Metoprolol, as above
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on metoprolol.
   - Continue with metoprolol
   - Will need eval for ICD pending neurologic assessment
   # NEURO:  Appears to have improved slightly from OSH evaluation to now
   (withdraws to pain; [**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN, following some minor commands with tracknig
   of eyes)
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.
   - Given that this is unlikely to be an ischemic arrest, will favor not
   transfusing to >30.
   - Given transfusion today, will defer checking iron studies but will
   add on a retic ct
   - Guaiac stools
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Will give free water via OG.
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely peri-code, but will work-up any fevers with
   culutures, UA.  CXR with possible LLL infiltrate; did have multifocal
   opacities on chest CT which may have represented aspiration.  Was being
   treated with vanco/unasyn and azithro.
   - If has PNA, most likely aspiration; therefore will cover with
   pip/tazo for now.  No recent hospitalizations before arrest so no clear
   need for MRSA coverage with vancomycin

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Continue metoprolol 12.5 TID PO (on carvedilol as an outpatient)
   - Continue aspirin 325mg
   # PUMP:  Most recent echo at OSH showed an EF that was unchanged from
   prior (~30%).  No known etiology for depressed EF.  Lungs appear clear
   on CXR.
   - Restart losartan at home dose
   - Lasix PRN; will need to ensure she is dry before extubation
   - Metoprolol, as above
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on metoprolol.
   - Continue with metoprolol
   - Will need eval for ICD pending neurologic assessment
   # NEURO:  Appears to have improved slightly from OSH evaluation to now
   (withdraws to pain; [**Name8 (MD) 24**] RN, following some minor commands with tracknig
   of eyes)
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.
   - Given that this is unlikely to be an ischemic arrest, will favor not
   transfusing to >30.
   - Given transfusion today, will defer checking iron studies but will
   add on a retic ct
   - Guaiac stools
   # HYPERNATREMIA:  Will give free water via OG.
   # LEUKOCYTOSIS:  Likely peri-code, but will work-up any fevers with
   culutures, UA.  CXR with possible LLL infiltrate; did have multifocal
   opacities on chest CT which may have represented aspiration.  Was being
   treated with vanco/unasyn and azithro.
   - If has PNA, most likely aspiration; therefore will cover with
   pip/tazo for now.  No recent hospitalizations before arrest so no clear
   need for MRSA coverage with vancomycin

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting in the ICU after a ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient is currently intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation.

From the 24-hour events section, it is mentioned that the patient has improved significantly, with increased responsiveness and ability to follow minor commands. The patient required frequent suctioning of secretions from the trachea. The patient also showed spontaneous breathing efforts over the ventilator.

The vital signs are within normal limits, with a temperature of 37.7Â°C (99.9Â°F), heart rate of 58 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 134/61 to 131/81 mmHg, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is sinus bradycardia.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on a ventilator in CMV/ASSIST/AutoFlow mode with a set tidal volume of 550 mL and respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute. The peak inspiratory pressure is 27 cmH2O, plateau pressure is 20 cmH2O, and compliance is 36.7 cmH2O/mL. The patient's SpO2 is maintained at 100%.

The physical examination reveals no acute distress, coughing, and a gag reflex intact. Cardiovascular examination shows a hyperdynamic precordium, S4"

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting to the ICU after a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She was transferred from another hospital where she had undergone an echocardiogram showing left ventricular cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 30%, moderate diastolic dysfunction, mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, and mild pulmonary hypertension.

The patient's recent events in the ICU include being restarted on Lasix 20 mg and having her inferior vena cava (IJ) line removed. She failed a spontaneous breathing trial due to copious secretions and was given a scopolamine patch. A neurology consult is planned in the morning, regardless of her current condition. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 37.5Â°C (99.5Â°F), heart rate of 83 bpm, blood pressure ranging from 150/59 to 157/85 mmHg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Her rhythm is sinus.

Her laboratory results show normal white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count, but elevated creatinine and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The echocardiogram findings remain unchanged from admission.

The patient's assessment and plan include respiratory failure, altered mental status, and cardiac arrest. She is being managed with various medications, such as metoprolol, aspirin, and losart"

","Based on the provided progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient has been experiencing several medical complications and events during her stay in the ICU.

1. Failed spontaneous breathing trial: The patient failed her breathing trial due to copious secretions and was given a scopolamine patch to manage these secretions. This indicates respiratory distress and difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation.

2. Neurological evaluation: The patient's neurological status has shown significant improvement since admission but remains unchanged from yesterday. A neuro consult has been placed to further evaluate for anoxic brain injury.

3. Fluid balance: The patient has a positive fluid balance of 404 mL since 12 AM, indicating that more fluid is being given to her than she is excreting. This can contribute to fluid overload and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.

4. Hemodynamic monitoring: The patient's blood pressure is relatively stable, with a range of 150/59-157/85 mmHg. However, the heart rate is on the higher end of normal at 83 bpm. The heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

5. Oxygenation: The patient's oxygen saturation is consistently above 95% on supplemental oxygen.

6. Laboratory results: The patient's white blood cell count is slightly elevated at 13.0 K/uL, indicating a possible infection. Other laboratory values,"

   Echo [**2137-11-12**]: The left atrium is elongated. Left ventricular wall
   thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is moderate to severe
   global left ventricular hypokinesis (LVEF = 30 %) with somre preserved
   contraction of the basal inferolateral and anterolateral walls. Tissue
   Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
   (PCWP>18mmHg). Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
   consistent with Grade II (moderate) LV diastolic dysfunction. Right
   ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic
   valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
   excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are
   structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to
   moderate ([**12-12**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary
   artery systolic hypertension. There is an anterior space which most
   likely represents a fat pad.
   IMPRESSION: Global left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Moderate diastolic
   dysfunction with elevated filling pressures. Mild to moderate mitral
   regurgitation. Mild pulmonary hypertension.
   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on carvedilol, sinus.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - ICD as above.
   # Pulmonary.  Failed RSBI yesterday, this morning with copious
   secretions, agitation.  Concern that pt will not be able to protect
   airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would like her to
   be reintubated if extubation fails.
   - Continue Zosyn for now, given concern for PNA with GNR in sputum
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - does not appear to be in pulmonary edema, will continue with home
   Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   # NEURO:  Improved significantly since arrival (see above for exam
   findings), but is unchanged from yesterday.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 285**] to further evaluate anoxic brain injury, Neurology will see.
   - f/u neuro consult
   - f/u EEG
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on carvedilol, sinus.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - ICD as above.
   # Pulmonary.  Failed RSBI yesterday, this morning with copious
   secretions, agitation.  Concern that pt will not be able to protect
   airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would like her to
   be reintubated if extubation fails.
   - Continue Zosyn for now, given concern for PNA with GNR in sputum
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - does not appear to be in pulmonary edema, will continue with home
   Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   # NEURO:  Improved significantly since arrival (see above for exam
   findings), but is unchanged from yesterday.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 285**] to further evaluate anoxic brain injury, Neurology will see.
   - f/u neuro consult
   - f/u EEG
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; recieved one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   FEN: 1.5L fluid restriction; start tube feeds today with IVF for

   Disposition:
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation. 

The patient's vital signs include a temperature of 37.7Â°C, heart rate of 63 beats per minute, blood pressure of 124/51 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient's heart rhythm is currently sinus rhythm.

The patient's neurological status appears unchanged, with occasional follow commands and withdrawal from pain. An MRI of the head has been recommended to assess for any anoxic brain injury. The patient's EEG results are pending.

The patient's lab results show normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and magnesium. However, the patient's glucose level is elevated at 161 mg/dL. Other lab values, including liver function tests and kidney function tests, are within normal limits.

The patient's fluid balance shows a positive fluid intake of 1,783 mL and output of 1,620 mL since midnight, resulting in a fluid balance of +163 mL. The patient's urine output has been good, with a total output of 1,620 mL since midnight.

The patient's respiratory support includes being on CPAP/PSV mode with a tidal"

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting to the ICU after a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She is currently experiencing difficulty extubating and has unchanged neurologic status, sometimes following commands and at times not. The patient has an ejection fraction of 30% and is classified as Class II heart failure at baseline. There is no indication for a beta-blocker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at this time. The patient also has iron deficiency anemia and received one unit of packed red blood cells (pRBC) at OSH. Fluid restriction and tube feeds are initiated for nutritional support. Prophylactic measures include deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention with subcutaneous heparin and stress ulcer prophylaxis.

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Ventricular fibrillation: The patient had a previous episode of ventricular fibrillation, which can potentially recur if not properly managed.
2. Extubation difficulty: The patient is experiencing difficulty extubating, which may lead to airway compromise if not addressed promptly.
3. Neurologic impairment: The patient's neurologic status is unchanged, and she sometimes follows commands but does not appear to follow commands consistently. This could indicate ongoing brain injury or other neurological issues.
4. Heart failure: The patient has a reduced ejection fraction of 30% and is classified as Class II heart failure. This puts her at"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this will likely not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.  Now
   on carvedilol, sinus.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - ICD as above.
   # Pulmonary.  Failed RSBI yesterday, this morning with copious
   secretions, agitation.  Concern that pt will not be able to protect
   airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would like her to
   be reintubated if extubation fails.
   - Continue Zosyn for now, given concern for PNA with GNR in sputum
   - f/u sputum cultures
   - does not appear to be in pulmonary edema, will continue with home
   Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams

   findings), but is unchanged from yesterday.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
   [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 285**] to further evaluate anoxic brain injury, Neurology will see.

   to w/ up further.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She is currently on mechanical ventilation and has been experiencing difficulty extubating. Her neurologic status appears unchanged, with occasional follow-up commands and no purposeful movements. She has an ejection fraction of 30% and is in diastolic and systolic heart failure. The etiology of her heart failure is unknown. She is on carvedilol, lasix, and losartan for heart failure management. She also has a history of ventricular fibrillation, which was successfully shocked back into sinus rhythm. There are concerns about her ability to protect her airway if extubated, so reintubation is planned if extubation fails. She has anemia and is being monitored for further evaluation. Fluid restriction and tube feeds have been initiated. Prophylaxis measures include DVT and stress ulcer prophylaxis. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Respiratory complications: Given the patient's difficulty in extubating and the presence of copious secretions, there is a risk of respiratory failure if she is reintubated.
2. Cardiovascular complications: The patient's ejection fraction is low (30%), indicating reduced cardiac function. This puts her at risk for further cardiac events such as arrhythmias or heart failure exacerbation.
3. Neurological complications: The patient's neurologic status is"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # Pulmonary.  The patient continues to have copious secretions.
   Concern that pt will not be able to protect airway if extubated.
   Discussed with family, and they would like her to be reintubated if
   extubation fails.   Today is the 7^th day the patient has the
   endotracheal tube; will try to extubate the patient tomorrow as she had
   tube feeds overnight; will stop the tube feeds after midnight and do a
   trial during rounds tomorrow.  If she fails the trial will consider
   getting a trach/PEG.
   - Continue Zosyn for now, given concern for PNA with GNR in sputum; f/u
   speciation
   - does not appear to be in pulmonary edema, will continue with home
   Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation and long-term plan
   determination.
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.
   Continues to be in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD as above.
   # NEURO:  Improved significantly since arrival, but is unchanged from
   yesterday.  Contact[**Name (NI) **] Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 285**] to further evaluate anoxic
   brain injury.  Neurology saw the patient yesterday and felt that she
   will likely continue to
   - Appreciate neuro consult, will f/u recs
   - Is to have MRI of her brain today.
   - f/u EEG
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this does not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; received one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.  Hct stable today at 25.8.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   FEN: continue tube feeds today with IVF for maintenance (D5 1/2NS)
   ACCESS: PIV X 1, arterial line; will have PICC placed due to likely
   long term access requirement.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   CODE: Full code for now, continued discussion with family
   DISPO: CCU until extubation.

","Summary of Progress Note:

The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy (CM) who presented to the ICU after experiencing ventricular fibrillation (vfib) arrest. The patient was successfully resuscitated and transferred to the ICU for further management. Since admission, the patient has been on mechanical ventilation and has been challenging to extubate. Neurologically, the patient's status remains unchanged, with occasional responsiveness and withdrawal from pain. 

The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a heart rate ranging from 63-76 bpm, blood pressure between 124/51-68 mmHg, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. The patient is currently on multiple medications, including lasix, scopolamine, propofol, and heparin.

Laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, slightly low hemoglobin level, and normal platelet count. Blood glucose levels have been fluctuating between 122-162 mg/dL. Other lab values, such as creatinine, potassium, and liver enzymes, are within normal range.

Assessment and Plan:

1. Pulmonary: The patient continues to have copious secretions, and there is concern about the ability to protect the airway if extubated. The family has agreed to reintubation if extubation fails. The plan is to attempt extubation tomorrow after stopping tube feeds overnight. If unsuccessful"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # Pulmonary.  The patient continues to have copious secretions but
   appears to be oral secretions.  Concern that pt will not be able to
   protect airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would
   like her to be reintubated if extubation fails.   Today is the 8^th day
   the patient has the endotracheal tube; will have SBT today for possible
   extubation.  If she fails the trial will consider getting a trach/PEG.
   - Change Zosyn to Ceftriaxone today given sputum sensitivities
   - continue with home Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   - extubate today
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation and long-term plan
   determination.
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.
   Continues to be in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD as above.
   # NEURO: Per neurology team, pt has no evidence of diffuse hypoxic
   injury and would expect some degree of continued recovery.  F/U with
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**] as outpatient.
   - per neuro, use Haldol for agitation, on PRN Haldol
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**]
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this does not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; received one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.  Hct stable today at 24.3.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   FEN: continue tube feeds today with IVF for maintenance (D5 1/2NS)
   ACCESS: PIV X 1, arterial line; will have PICC placed due to likely
   long term access requirement.
   PROPHYLAXIS:

   DISPO: CCU until extubation.
","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting on transfer after a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She is currently intubated and experiencing difficulty extubating. Neurological status appears unchanged, with occasional follow-up commands and disorganized background on EEG indicating widespread encephalopathy. The patient has increased signal in both thalami on MRI, likely due to subacute changes from hypoxia. 

She continues to have copious secretions but appears to be oral secretions. There is concern that she may not be able to protect her airway if extubated. The family has agreed to reintubation if extubation fails. The patient will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial today for possible extubation. If she fails the trial, tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be considered. 

The patient's heart failure is consistent with both diastolic and systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 30%. She has class II heart failure at baseline, so a biventricular pacing device is not needed. The etiology of heart failure is unknown. No indication for spironolactone is needed. Digoxin was considered but the patient was felt to be in compensated heart failure at this time, so no need to start it.

","The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiac arrest who presented to the hospital after experiencing ventricular fibrillation. She was initially intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation but has now been successfully extubated. The patient's neurologic status is slowly improving, and she is showing signs of recovery.

The patient's current vital signs include a temperature of 38.3Â°C (101Â°F), heart rate of 79 beats per minute, blood pressure of 132/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97% on 50% FiO2. Her heart rhythm is sinus rhythm with occasional bigeminy.

Laboratory results show leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14,000 cells/mmÂ³, elevated C-reactive protein level of 25.3 mg/dL, and increased lactate dehydrogenase level of 256 IU/L. Blood cultures have grown gram-negative rods and budding yeast with pseudohyphae. Sensitivity testing indicates that the isolate is sensitive to ceftriaxone.

The patient's pulmonary status is improving, and she has been successfully extubated. Sputum culture showed enterobacter cloacae, which is sensitive to zosyn. Therefore, the antibiotic was changed accordingly.

The patient has a history of heart failure with an ejection fraction of 30%, but no specific etiology has been identified"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now with difficulty extubating.  Neurologic status appears
   unchanged; pt sometimes follows commands and at times does not.
   # Pulmonary.  The patient continues to have copious secretions but
   appears to be oral secretions.  Concern that pt will not be able to
   protect airway if extubated.  Discussed with family, and they would
   like her to be reintubated if extubation fails.   Today is the 8^th day
   the patient has the endotracheal tube; will have SBT today for possible
   extubation.  If she fails the trial will consider getting a trach/PEG.
   - Change Zosyn to Ceftriaxone today given sputum sensitivities
   - continue with home Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily
   - stop propofol prior to neuro exams
   - extubate today
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c pending Neuro evaluation and long-term plan
   determination.
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.
   Continues to be in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD as above.
   # NEURO: Per neurology team, pt has no evidence of diffuse hypoxic
   injury and would expect some degree of continued recovery.  F/U with
   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**] as outpatient.
   - per neuro, use Haldol for agitation, on PRN Haldol
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**]
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this does not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 12.5mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; received one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.  Hct stable today at 24.3.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   FEN: continue tube feeds today with IVF for maintenance (D5 1/2NS)
   ACCESS: PIV X 1, arterial line; will have PICC placed due to likely
   long term access requirement.
   PROPHYLAXIS:
   -DVT ppx with SC heparin
   CODE: Full code for now, continued discussion with family
   DISPO: CCU until extubation.
","Summary of the Progress Note:
- The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiac myopathy (CM) who presented after experiencing a ventricular fibrillation (vfib) arrest. 
- She is currently in the ICU, intubated and on invasive ventilation. 
- The patient had difficulty extubating yesterday and was given haloperidol (Haldol) as needed for agitation. 
- Her neurological status remains unchanged, with occasional follow-up commands and withdrawal from pain. 
- The patient continues to have copious oral secretions, raising concerns about airway protection if extubated. 
- The family has agreed to reintubation if extubation fails. 
- The patient will undergo a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) today for possible extubation. If unsuccessful, a tracheostomy (trach) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may be considered. 
- Zosyn was changed to Ceftriaxone due to sensitivities. 
- The patient remains febrile. 
- Other medications include pantoprazole (Protonix), labelol, heparin sodium (prophylaxis), and haloperidol (Haldol). 
- The patient's vital signs are stable, with a temperature of 38.3Â°C, heart rate of 79 bpm, blood pressure of 132/60 mmHg, respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 97%. 
- The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 481 mL. 
- The patient's lab results indicate leukocytosis, slightly elevated creatinine, and normal electrolyte levels. 
- Assessment and plan include ongoing monitoring, potential extubation trial, and consideration for trach/PEG if unsuccessful. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Airway compromise: The patient's copious secretions raise concerns about protecting her airway if she is extubated. If she is unable to clear her secretions effectively, it may lead to respiratory distress or failure.
2. Neurological impairment: The patient's neurological status is still uncertain, with occasional follow-up commands and withdrawal from pain. There is a risk of further neurological deterioration, which could impact her ability to breathe independently and increase the risk of respiratory complications.
3. Infection: Despite being on antibiotics, the patient remains febrile. This suggests a possible ongoing infection, which could lead to sepsis and respiratory complications if it spreads to the lungs.
4. Fluid imbalance: The patient's fluid balance shows a negative balance of 481 mL. This indicates a potential fluid deficit, which could contribute to hypotension and decreased organ perfusion.
5. Medication reactions/allergies: Although no known drug allergies are reported, there is always a risk of medication reactions or allergies that could manifest as respiratory complications."

   Chief Complaint:
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.
   24 Hour Events:
   The patient neurologically remains similar to yesterday.  She can
   follow some commands and speak sometimes, but not consistently.  EP
   evaluated her for ICD and want to wait until she has more neurologic
   recovery before proceeding with ICD placement.  Her TSH was checked and
   was 1.6.  Her carvedilol was increased to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for htn.  Her
   antibiotics were stopped.  Speech and swallow saw the patient and
   recommended thin liquids and soft consistency solids with supervision,
   meds crushed with apple sauce.  Also rec'ed a cognitive-linguistic eval
   and tx here and in rehab as able.  She was called out to the floor, but
   didn't get a room.  It was decided to given her a standing baby ativan
   dose at night for sleep and to discuss a possible standing haldol dose
   for her with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**].  She got OOB to the chair today.

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now extubated.  Neurologic status slowly improving.
   # Pulmonary/Fevers.  The patient was extubated successfully.  Her
   oxygen requirement has remained stable on 3L.  Sputum Cx w.
   enterobacter cloacae sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) 2696**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Zosyn changed to [**First Name3 (LF) **];
   however she had received 10 days of antibiotics total.  This species
   has been known to grow resistant to 3^rd gen ceph, so will monitor
   fever curve and Cx, repeat sputum if necessary.   Patient had a
   low-grade fever of 100.4 yesterday, no growth from recent cultures so
   far.  Patient developed diarrhea yesterday, cdiff pending.  U/A from
   [**11-17**] negative.
   - Patient has received 10 days of antibiotics so will dc her
   antibiotics today.
   - F/u culture data, c.diff, and monitor for fevers off antibiotics.
   - continue with home Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily to decrease secretions
   - CIS
   - Continue chest PT prn
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.  Changed to labetalol IV for BP control as not
   tolerating PO, but now pt. able to take PO meds, thus carvedilol was
   restarted.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Increase carvedilol to 25 mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c; will touch base with EP as to the timing of
   this.
   # HTN. Pt continues w/ systolic BPs 140-160s.  Goal is SBP 130 or less
   to reduce afterload and improve forward flow.
   - Increase Carvedilol to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better control of her

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after a ventricular fibrillation arrest. She is currently extubated and shows slow neurological improvement. The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, with a blood pressure of 163/57 mmHg and heart rate of 90 bpm. She is receiving various medications including carvedilol for hypertension, heparin for prophylaxis, and pantoprazole for stress ulcer. The patient has received a total of 10 days of antibiotics and is being monitored for any signs of infection. Further evaluation and follow-up are recommended for her heart failure, anemia, and agitation. 

Potential Medical Complications:
1. Infection: The patient has been on antibiotics for an extended period, which increases the risk of antibiotic-associated complications such as Clostridium difficile (C. diff) infection. Monitoring for diarrhea and checking for C. diff toxin levels would be important.
2. Heart Failure: The patient has evidence of both diastolic and systolic heart failure with an ejection fraction (EF) of 30%. It is crucial to optimize her heart failure management with medications such as losartan, Lasix, and carvedilol.
3. Hypertension: The patient's systolic blood pressure remains elevated, indicating uncontrolled hypertension. Adjustments in her antihypertensive regimen may be necessary.
4. Arrhythmias: Despite"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now extubated.  Neurologic status slowly improving.
   # Neuro: The patient is slowly improving.  Her MRI did show subacute
   changes likely from a hypoxic event. Neuro is following and feels that
   further recovery is likely.
   - Per neuro, use Haldol for agitation, on PRN Haldol; will add a
   standing qhs dose to decrease agitation at night so she can sleep.
   - Appreciate neuro consult, will f/u recs.
   - Speech evaluation and therapy
   - PT/OT
   - Plan is for patient to follow up as an outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**]
   # Pulmonary:  The patient was extubated successfully a few days ago.
   Her oxygen requirement has remained stable on 3L-4L.  Sputum Cx w.
   enterobacter cloacae sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) 2696**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Zosyn changed to [**First Name3 (LF) **];
   however she had received 10 days of antibiotics yesterday so her
   antibiotics were stopped.  She has been afebrile off her antibiotics.
   - F/u culture data, c.diff, and monitor for fevers off antibiotics.
   - continue with home Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily to decrease secretions
   - CIS
   - Continue chest PT prn
   - Will check a CXR in a day or two to ensure she is not having silent
   aspiration (per swallow consult recs).
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.
   - Losartan 100 mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Continue carvedilol 25 mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c; EP prefers to wait for further neurological
   recovery before proceeding.  Appreciate EP consult, will f/u recs.
   # HTN. Pt continues w/ systolic BPs 130-150s.  Goal is SBP 130 or less
   to reduce afterload and improve forward flow.
   - Continue increased Carvedilol dose at 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better control of
   her hypertension.
   - Will increase her losartan to 100 mg daily for better control.
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.
   Continues to be in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Carvedilol 25 mg  PO BID
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD as above.
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this does not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 25 mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; received one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.  Hct stable today at 28.5 (from 26.6).
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   # Agitation
 Patient slept throughout the night.
   - Sleep hygiene:  TV off after 10pm, maintain patient awake throughout
   the day, OOB to chair as tolerated during the day
   - Haldol standing dose qhs.
   - Ativan prn after haldol if needed for sleep.
   FEN: cardiac diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids with
   supervision.
   -  Appreciate swallow consult, will f/u recs.

","Based on the information provided in the progress note, the patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing ventricular fibrillation arrest. The patient's neurological status has shown slight improvement over the past day. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure ranging from 114/53 mmHg to 170/95 mmHg, heart rate between 72-90 bpm, respiratory rate of 22-36 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 95% on a nasal cannula. The patient is currently in sinus rhythm.

The patient has received various treatments and interventions, including antibiotics for a suspected infection (enterobacter cloacae), carvedilol for hypertension and heart failure, Lasix for fluid management, and heparin for DVT prophylaxis. The patient's laboratory results indicate normal values for white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. However, the patient's troponin-T levels remain elevated at 2.

The patient's physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities, with clear lungs, normal heart sounds, and no edema or cyanosis in the extremities. Neurologically, the patient is alert and oriented to person and place, but not time. She moves all extremities spontaneously and to command, but there is some confusion.

The patient's plan of care includes ongoing monitoring"

   Assessment and Plan
   64F with history of idiopathic CM presenting on transfer after vfib
   arrest.  Now extubated.  Neurologic status slowly improving.
   # Pulmonary/Fevers.  The patient was extubated successfully.  Her
   oxygen requirement has remained stable on 3L.  Sputum Cx w.
   enterobacter cloacae sensitive to [**Last Name (LF) 2696**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] Zosyn changed to [**First Name3 (LF) **];
   however she had received 10 days of antibiotics total.  This species
   has been known to grow resistant to 3^rd gen ceph, so will monitor
   fever curve and Cx, repeat sputum if necessary.   Patient had a
   low-grade fever of 100.4 yesterday, no growth from recent cultures so
   far.  Patient developed diarrhea yesterday, cdiff pending.  U/A from
   [**11-17**] negative.
   - Patient has received 10 days of antibiotics so will dc her
   antibiotics today.
   - F/u culture data, c.diff, and monitor for fevers off antibiotics.
   - continue with home Lasix of 20mg PO qday
   - scopolamine patch daily to decrease secretions
   - CIS
   - Continue chest PT prn
   # PUMP:  Echo is consistent with both diastolic and systolic heart
   failure with an EF of 30%.    Per OP provider, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] has Class II HF at
   baseline, thus no BiV pacer needed.   Etiology of heart failure is
   unknown. No indication for spironolactone.  Digoxin was considered but
   pt was felt to be in compensated HF at this time and no need to start
   at this point.  Changed to labetalol IV for BP control as not
   tolerating PO, but now pt. able to take PO meds, thus carvedilol was
   restarted.
   - Losartan 50mg PO qday
   - Lasix 20mg QD maintenance
   - Increase carvedilol to 25 mg PO BID
   - Will get ICD before d/c; will touch base with EP as to the timing of
   this.
   # HTN. Pt continues w/ systolic BPs 140-160s.  Goal is SBP 130 or less
   to reduce afterload and improve forward flow.
   - Increase Carvedilol to 25 mg [**Hospital1 **] for better control of her
   hypertension.
   - Will monitor and if still elevated tomorrow increase her losartan to
   100 mg daily.
   # RHYTHM:  Vfib noted on EMS tracings.  Shocked back into sinus.
   Continues to be in normal sinus rhythm on telemetry.
   - Carvedilol 25 mg  PO BID
   - Monitor on telemetry.
   - ICD as above.
   # NEURO: Per neurology team, pt has no evidence of diffuse hypoxic
   injury and would expect some degree of continued recovery.  Pt. slowly
   improving.  F/U with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**] as outpatient.
   - per neuro, use Haldol for agitation, on PRN Haldol, QTc 466; will
   discuss whether a standing dose is needed.
   - f/u Neuro recs
   - outpatient with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**]
   # CORONARIES:  No known CAD with cardiac cath in [**7-17**] showing no flow
   limiting lesions.   Given this does not require catheterization.
   - Carvedilol 25 mg PO BID
   - no aspirin because coronaries are clean
   # ANEMIA:  Known to have iron deficiency anemia; received one unit of
   pRBC at OSH.   HCT stable, pt asymptomatic, since unlikely ischemic in
   origin will not transfuse.  Retic hypoproliferative.  Fe studies as OP
   to w/ up further.  Hct stable today at 26.6.
   - Guaiac stools
   - will hold on transfusion as pt does not have ischemic cardiac
   disease, hemodynamics stable.  Continue to monitor
   # Agitation
 Patient slept throughout the night.
   - Sleep hygiene:  TV off after 10pm, maintain patient awake throughout
   the day, OOB to chair as tolerated during the day
   - Haldol prn; will discuss with neurology to see if a standing dose
   should be written.
   - Ativan qhs for sleep.
   FEN: cardiac diet of thin liquids and soft consistency solids with
   supervision.
   -  Appreciate swallow consult, will f/u recs.

","Summary:
The patient is a 64-year-old female with a history of idiopathic cardiomyopathy who presented to the ICU after experiencing ventricular fibrillation. She has shown slight neurological improvement over the past day. The patient's TSH level was checked and came back normal. Her carvedilol dosage was increased to 25 mg for hypertension management. Antibiotics were stopped as she has received a total of 10 days of treatment. The patient was evaluated by speech and swallow specialists, recommending thin liquids and soft solids with supervision. Medications should be crushed with apple sauce. A cognitive-linguistic evaluation and treatment plan were recommended for both inpatient and outpatient settings. The patient was called out to the floor but did not get a room. It was decided to give her a standing baby Ativan dose at night for sleep and discuss a possible standing Haldol dose with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 285**]. She successfully transitioned from being extubated to using a nasal cannula for oxygen delivery. Her ABG results are pending. The patient is oriented to person and partially to place, but not time. She responds to commands, moves all extremities spontaneously and to command, and can answer basic questions but remains confused. The patient's vital signs are stable, with a blood pressure range of 163/57-170/95 mmHg. She has been experiencing low-grade fever, and sputum cultures have shown sensitivity to [**"
